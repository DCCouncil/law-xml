    <text>The collection of any or all of the amount of the assessment may be stayed by filing with the Mayor a bond in an amount, equal to 150% of the amount to be stayed, and with sureties as the Mayor may approve, conditioned upon the payment of the amount (together with interest accruing thereon) for which the collection is stayed. The taxpayer shall have the right to waive the stay at any time in respect to the whole or any part of the amount covered by the bond, and if, as a result of the waiver, part of the assessment covered by the bond is paid, the bond shall, at the request of the taxpayer, be proportionately reduced. If a part of the assessment is abated, the bond shall, at the request of the taxpayer, be proportionately reduced.</text>
