      <text>A licensee whose license has been expired for at least 6 months shall be treated as a new applicant and not as an applicant for renewal, unless otherwise provided by applicable law. If the new applicant conducted business during the 6 months after the expiration date of the license without complying with the renewal procedures pursuant to this section, the applicant shall be deemed to have conducted business without a license and shall be liable for any and all fees and fines applicable to conducting business without a license. A new application for a license shall not be processed until all applicable fines and fees have been paid.</text>
