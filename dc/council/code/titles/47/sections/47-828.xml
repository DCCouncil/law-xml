    <annotation type="Effect of Amendments">The 2013 amendment by <law-cite doc="D.C. Law 19-317">D.C. Law 19-317</law-cite> substituted “not more than the amount set forth in [§ <cite path="§22-3571.01">22-3571.01</cite>]” for “not more than $10,000”.</annotation>
    <annotation type="Emergency Legislation">For temporary (90 days) amendment of this section, see § 286(d) of the Criminal Fine Proportionality Emergency Act of 2013 (D.C. Act 20-45, April 1, 2013,  60 DCR 5400, 20 DCSTAT 1300).</annotation>
    <annotation type="References in Text">“The 1st section of the Act of March 3, 1881 (§ <cite path="§47-211">47-211</cite>),” referred to in this section, appears identical with the original. However, the citation to § <cite path="§47-211">47-211</cite> appears to be erroneous, as that section is based on § 14 of 28 Stat. 285, approved August 14, 1894, rather than the 1881 Act.</annotation>
