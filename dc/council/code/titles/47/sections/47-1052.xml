The proceeds shall be applied towards the delinquent PILOT, including interest and penalties thereon; provided, that the proceeds from the sale shall be applied first toward any delinquent water and sewer charges, and then toward any delinquent litter control nuisance fines, in accordance, respectively with §§ <cite path="§34-2407.02">34-2407.02</cite> and <cite path="§34-2110">34-2110</cite>, and § <cite path="§8-807">8-807</cite>).
