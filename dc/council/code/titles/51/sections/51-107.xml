      <text>An individual’s “weekly benefit amount” shall be an amount equal to one twenty-sixth (computed to the next higher multiple of $1) of his total wages for insured work paid during that quarter of his base period in which such total wages were highest, with such other following limitations. The Director shall determine annually a maximum weekly benefit amount by computing 66 2/3% of the average weekly wage paid to employees in insured work, and shall on or before January 1st of the calendar year in which it shall be effective announce by publication in at least 1 newspaper of general circulation in the District, the maximum weekly benefit amount so determined. Such computation shall be made by determining total wages reported as paid for insured work by employers in each 12-month period ending June 30th and dividing said total wages by a figure resulting from 52 times the average of mid-month employment reported by employers for the same period. For the period from March 30, 1962, to December 31, 1962, the maximum weekly benefit amount shall be determined and announced by the Director in accordance with the foregoing formula on the basis of wages and employment in the 12-month period ending June 30, 1961. The maximum weekly benefit amount so determined and announced for a calendar year shall apply only to those claims filed in that year qualifying for maximum payment under the foregoing formula. All claims qualifying for payment at the maximum weekly benefit amount shall be paid at the maximum weekly benefit amount in effect when the benefit year to which the claim relates was first established, notwithstanding a change in said amount for a subsequent calendar year. If the maximum weekly benefit amount is not a multiple of $1, then said maximum weekly benefit amount shall be computed to the next multiple of $1.</text>

Any such certification by the Director shall be accompanied by a recommended maximum weekly benefit amount which shall not be less than the maximum weekly benefit amount then in effect and which shall become the maximum weekly benefit amount for the next calendar year, unless the Council passes a resolution disapproving the Director’s recommendation within 45 days after its receipt.</text>

      <text>If a claimant satisfies the above except that he received wages over the amount necessary to become eligible for maximum benefits, in the quarter in which his wages were the highest, then the additional wages received in such quarter shall not be considered in determining eligibility. Notwithstanding the provisions of paragraph (1)(C) of this subsection, any otherwise qualified individual, the total amount of whose wages during such period is less than the amount required to have been received during such period under such paragraph, may qualify for benefits, if the difference between the amounts so required to have been received and the total amount of his wages during such period does not exceed $70, but the amount of his weekly benefit, as computed under subsection (b) of this section, shall be reduced by $1 if such difference does not exceed $35, or by $2 if such difference is more than $35. Wages received by an individual in the period intervening between the end of his last base period and the beginning of his last benefit year shall not be available for benefit purposes in a subsequent benefit year unless he has, subsequent to the commencement of such last benefit year, performed services for which he received wages for employment as defined in this subchapter, in an amount equal to at least 10 times the weekly benefit amount for which he qualifies in such last benefit year. Benefits payable to an individual with respect to a week shall be reduced by any amount received or applied for with respect to such week as a retirement pension or annuity under a public or private retirement plan or system provided, or contributed to, by any base period employer; except that no reduction shall be made under this sentence for any amount received under title II of the Social Security Act. For benefit years beginning on or after July 1, 2004, benefits payable to an individual who applied for or is receiving a retirement pension or annuity under a public or private retirement plan or system provided or contributed to by any base period employer shall, under duly prescribed regulations, be reduced (but not below zero) by the prorated weekly amount of such retirement pension or annuity which is reasonably attributable to such week, provided that the claimant has not made contributions to the pension or annuity. An amount received with respect to a period other than a week shall be prorated by weeks. When an individual’s weekly benefit amount is reduced by a pension, the individual’s maximum weekly benefit amount shall be deducted from his total amount of benefits determined pursuant to subsection (d) of this section. Benefits payable to an individual with respect to a week shall be reduced by the amount of wages received in lieu of notice of dismissal, defined as dismissal payments that the employer is not legally required to make.</text>

    <text>In addition to the benefits payable under the foregoing subsections of this section, each eligible individual who is unemployed in any week shall be paid with respect to such week $5 for each dependent relative, but not more than $20 shall be paid to an individual as dependent’s allowance with respect to any 1 week of unemployment nor shall any weekly benefit which includes a dependent’s allowance be paid in the amount of more than the established maximum benefit amount. An individual’s number of dependents shall be determined as of the day with respect to which he first files a valid claim for benefits in any benefit year, and shall be fixed for the duration of such benefit year. The dependent’s allowance is not to be taken into consideration in calculating the claimant’s total amount of benefits in subsection (d) of this section; provided, however, that this section shall not apply to claims for benefit years commencing on or after January 5, 1997.</text>

The amount of the dependent’s allowance paid to an individual shall not be charged to the individual account of an employer. The number of dependents of an individual shall be determined as of the day with respect to which the individual first files a valid claim for benefits in any benefit year and shall remain fixed for the duration of the benefit year.
