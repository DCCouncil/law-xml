Execution may issue for the enforcement of the judgment or decree, notwithstanding the attachment, but the money collected upon the execution shall be paid into court to abide the event of the proceedings in attachment and applied as the court directs.</text>

    <text>An attachment may be levied upon money or property of the defendant in the hands of the marshal. It binds the money or property from the time of service, and is a legal excuse to the officer for not paying or delivering the same as he would otherwise be bound to do.</text>
