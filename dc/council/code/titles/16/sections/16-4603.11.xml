    <text>If the court, upon the testimony of the petitioner or other witness, finds that the child is imminently likely to suffer serious physical harm or be removed from the District, it may issue a warrant to take physical custody of the child.

    <text>A warrant to take physical custody of a child is enforceable throughout the District.

If required by exigent circumstances of the case, the court may authorize law enforcement officers to make a forcible entry at any hour.</text>
