  <heading>Sealing and inspection of records and papers.</heading>
  <text>From and after the filing of the petition, records and papers in adoption proceedings shall be sealed.

Such records and papers shall, upon written application to the court, be unsealed and provided to the Child Fatality Review Committee for inspection if the adoptee is deceased and inspection of the records and papers is necessary for the discharge of the Committee’s official duties. The clerk of the court shall keep a separate docket for adoption proceedings.</text>
