The appointment of a personal representative shall constitute an Order for unsupervised administration, unless the Order specifically provides for supervised administration as provided in section 20-402. In no event, however, shall the appointment of a personal representative be delayed pending the Court’s decision with regard to whether the administration will be supervised or unsupervised.</text>
