The Order set forth the functions of the Chief Clerk’s section and abolished the previously existing office. This Order was issued pursuant to Reorganization Plan No. 5 of 1952.

Organization Order No. 8, dated April 18, 1968, revoked Organization Order No. 153 to the extent the same was inconsistent with Organization Order No. 8. Commissioner’s Order No. 69-614, dated November 13, 1969, provided in part that the Metropolitan Police Department shall continue in existence, headed by a Chief of Police who shall be responsible for the functions of said Department as previously established and constituted by Organization Order No. 153, as amended.</annotation>
