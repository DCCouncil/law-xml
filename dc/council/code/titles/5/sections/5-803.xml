    <text>If, at any time during a member’s conditional retirement, the Metropolitan Police Department finds that the allegations of serious misconduct are not sustained or are unfounded, the matter shall be deemed to be closed and the member’s pension rights and accrued benefits shall be paid retroactive to the date on which the member initially retired or resigned from the Metropolitan Police Department.</text>

    <text>If the Metropolitan Police Department sustains the allegations of serious misconduct, the disciplinary process shall proceed as if the member in conditional retirement continued to be a member of the Metropolitan Police Department.
