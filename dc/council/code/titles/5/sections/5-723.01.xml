          <text>If the benefit of a member begins before age 62, the defined benefit dollar limit applicable to the member at the earlier age shall be an annual benefit payable in the form a straight life annuity beginning at the earlier age that is the actuarial equivalent of the defined benefit dollar limit applicable to the member at age 62 (adjusted for participation of fewer than 10 years, if applicable) computed using a 5% interest rate and the applicable mortality table designated by the Secretary of the Treasury from time to time pursuant to section 417(e)(3) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986.
