    <para>
      <num>(1)</num>

The Commission may require the public utility to submit any additional information that, in the Commission’s judgment, is needed to satisfy the requirements set forth in subsection (a) of this section or to enable the Commission to make its decision concerning the reasonable safety and adequacy of the proposed facility.</text>
