    <text>The Bonds shall not constitute an indebtedness of the District. The Bonds are not general obligations of the District and are not secured by a pledge of or involve the faith and credit or the taxing power of the District. The Bonds are the special limited obligations of the District payable solely from the DDOT Underground Electric Company Infrastructure Improvement Property. Nothing contained in the Bonds, or in the related financing documents and closing documents, shall create an obligation on the part of the District to make payments with respect to the Bonds from sources other than the DDOT Underground Electric Company Infrastructure Improvement Revenue. The Bonds do not constitute lending of the public credit for private undertakings as prohibited in § <cite path="§1-206.02">1-206.02</cite>(a)(2).</text>
