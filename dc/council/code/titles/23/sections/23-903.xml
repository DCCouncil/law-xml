  <heading>“Fresh pursuit” defined.</heading>
  <text>For purposes of this chapter, the term “fresh pursuit” shall include fresh pursuit as defined by the common law, also the pursuit of a person who has committed a felony or one who the pursuing officer has reasonable grounds to believe has committed a felony. It shall also include the pursuit of a person who the pursuing officer has reasonable grounds to believe has committed a felony, although no felony has actually been committed, if there is reasonable ground for believing that a felony has been committed. Such term shall not necessarily imply an instant pursuit, but pursuit without unreasonable delay.</text>
