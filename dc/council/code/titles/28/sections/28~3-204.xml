    <text>“Indorsement” means a signature, other than that of a signer as maker, drawer, or acceptor, that alone or accompanied by other words is made on an instrument for the purpose of (i) negotiating the instrument, (ii) restricting payment of the instrument, or (iii) incurring indorser’s liability on the instrument, but regardless of the intent of the signer, a signature and its accompanying words is an indorsement unless the accompanying words, terms of the instrument, place of the signature, or other circumstances unambiguously indicate that the signature was made for a purpose other than indorsement. For the purpose of determining whether a signature is made on an instrument, a paper affixed to the instrument is a part of the instrument.</text>

    <text>If an instrument is payable to a holder under a name that is not the name of the holder, indorsement may be made by the holder in the name stated in the instrument or in the holder’s name or both, but signature in both names may be required by a person paying or taking the instrument for value or collection.</text>

    <text type="Uniform Commercial Code Comment">1. Subsection (a) is a definition of “indorsement,” a term which was not defined in former Article 3. Indorsement is defined in terms of the purpose of the signature. If a blank or special indorsement is made to give rights as a holder to a transferee the indorsement is made for the purpose of negotiating the instrument. Subsection (a)(i). If the holder of a check has an account in the drawee bank and wants to be sure that payment of the check will be made by credit to the holder’s account, the holder can indorse the check by signing the holder’s name with the accompanying words “for deposit only” before presenting the check for payment to the drawee bank. In that case the purpose of the quoted words is to restrict payment of the instrument. Subsection (a)(ii). If X wants to guarantee payment of a note signed by Y as maker, X can do so by signing X’s name to the back of the note as an indorsement. This indorsement is known as an anomalous indorsement ( Section 3-205(d)) and is made for the purpose of incurring indorser’s liability on the note. Subsection (a)(iii). In some cases an indorsement may serve more than one purpose. For example, if the holder of a check deposits it to the holder’s account in a depositary bank for collection and indorses the check by signing the holder’s name with the accompanying words “for deposit only” the purpose of the indorsement is both to negotiate the check to the depositary bank and to restrict payment of the check.</text>
    <text type="Uniform Commercial Code Comment">The “but” clause of the first sentence of subsection (a) elaborates on former  Section 3-402. In some cases it may not be clear whether a signature was meant to be that of an indorser, a party to the instrument in some other capacity such as drawer, maker or acceptor, or a person who was not signing as a party. The general rule is that a signature is an indorsement if the instrument does not indicate an unambiguous intent of the signer not to sign as an indorser. Intent may be determined by words accompanying the signature, the place of signature, or other circumstances. For example, suppose a depositary bank gives cash for a check properly indorsed by the payee. The bank requires the payee’s employee to sign the back of the check as evidence that the employee received the cash. If the signature consists only of the initials of the employee it is not reasonable to assume that it was meant to be an indorsement. If there was a full signature but accompanying words indicated that it was meant as a receipt for the cash given for the check, it is not an indorsement. If the signature is not qualified in any way and appears in the place normally used for indorsements, it may be an indorsement even though the signer intended the signature to be a receipt. To take another example, suppose the drawee of a draft signs the draft on the back in the space usually used for indorsements. No words accompany the signature. Since the drawee has no reason to sign a draft unless the intent is to accept the draft, the signature is effective as an acceptance. Custom and usage may be used to determine intent. For example, by long-established custom and usage, a signature in the lower right hand corner of an instrument indicates an intent to sign as the maker of a note or the drawer of a draft. Any similar clear indication of an intent to sign in some other capacity or for some other purpose may establish that a signature is not an indorsement. For example, if the owner of a traveler’s check countersigns the check in the process of negotiating it, the countersignature is not an indorsement. The countersignature is a condition to the issuer’s obligation to pay and its purpose is to provide a means of verifying the identity of the person negotiating the traveler’s check by allowing comparison of the specimen signature and the countersignature. The countersignature is not necessary for negotiation and the signer does not incur indorser’s liability. See Comment 2 to  Section 3-106.</text>
    <text type="Uniform Commercial Code Comment">The last sentence of subsection (a) is based on subsection (2) of former  Section 3-202. An indorsement on an allonge is valid even though there is sufficient space on the instrument for an indorsement.</text>
    <text type="Uniform Commercial Code Comment">2. Assume that Payee indorses a note to Creditor as security for a debt. Under subsection (b) of  Section 3-203 Creditor takes Payee’s rights to enforce or transfer the instrument subject to the limitations imposed by Article 9. Subsection (c) of  Section 3-204 makes clear that Payee’s indorsement to Creditor, even though it mentions creation of a security interest, is an unqualified indorsement that gives to Creditor the right to enforce the note as its holder.</text>
    <text type="Uniform Commercial Code Comment">3. Subsection (d) is a restatement of former  Section 3-203.  Section 3-110(a) states that an instrument is payable to the person intended by the person signing as or in the name or behalf of the issuer even if that person is identified by a name that is not the true name of the person. In some cases the name used in the instrument is a misspelling of the correct name and in some cases the two names may be entirely different. The payee may indorse in the name used in the instrument, in the payee’s correct name, or in both. In each case the indorsement is effective. But because an indorsement in a name different from that used in the instrument may raise a question about its validity and an indorsement in a name that is not the correct name of the payee may raise a problem of identifying the indorser, the accepted commercial practice is to indorse in both names. Subsection (d) allows a person paying or taking the instrument for value or collection to require indorsement in both names.</text>
