    <text type="Uniform Commercial Code Comment">2. Effectiveness of Mis-Indexed Records. This section provides that the filing office’s error in mis-indexing a record does not render ineffective an otherwise effective record. As did former  Section 9-401, this section imposes the risk of filing-office error on those who search the files rather than on those who file.</text>
