  <heading>Secured party not obligated on contract of debtor or in tort.</heading>
  <text>The existence of a security interest, agricultural lien, or authority given to a debtor to dispose of or use collateral, without more, does not subject a secured party to liability in contract or tort for the debtor’s acts or omissions.</text>

      <text>1. Source. Former  Section 9-317.</text>
      <text>2. Nonliability of Secured Party. This section, like former  Section 9-317, rejects theories on which a secured party might be held liable on a debtor’s contracts or in tort merely because a security interest exists or because the debtor is entitled to dispose of or use collateral. This section expands former  Section 9-317 to cover agricultural liens.</text>
