    <text type="Uniform Commercial Code Comment"><strong>Changes:</strong> Revised to reflect leasing practices and terminology. Note that in the analogue to subsection (2) ( Section 2-611(2)) the adjective “justifiably” modifies demanded. The adjective was deleted here (as it was in Section 2A-401) as unnecessary, implying no substantive change.</text>
