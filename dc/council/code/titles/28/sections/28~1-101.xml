    <text type="Editor's Notes">Section 39(a) of <cite doc="D.C. Law 15-354">D.C. Law 15-354</cite> provided that Title 28 is designated Title 28 of the District of Columbia Official Code.</text>
    <text type="Editor's Notes"><cite doc="D.C. Law 19-299">D.C. Law 19-299</cite> amended this article in its entirety, substituting present §§ <cite path="§28:1-101">28:1-101</cite> through 28:1-310 for former §§ <cite path="§28:1-101">28:1-101</cite> through 28:1-208. Although similar in many respects to former Article 1, the statute sections in the revised Article are sufficiently different that a detailed explanation of the changes was impracticable; however, where possible, the historical citations from the former sections have been transferred to the new, similar sections. Where appropriate, annotations to former sections have also been retained under corresponding sections in the amended article.</text>
