    <text type="Uniform Commercial Code Comment">This section states the duty of a bank handling a documentary draft for a customer. “Documentary draft” is defined in  Section 4-104. The duty stated exists even if the bank has bought the draft. This is because to the customer the draft normally represents an underlying commercial transaction, and if that is not going through as planned the customer should know it promptly.</text>
