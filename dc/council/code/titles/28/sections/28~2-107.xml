    <text type="Uniform Commercial Code Comment"><strong>Prior Uniform Statutory Provision:</strong> See Section 76, Uniform Sales Act on prior policy; Section 7, Uniform Conditional Sales Act.</text>
    <text type="Uniform Commercial Code Comment"><strong>Purposes:</strong> 1. Subsection (1). Notice that this subsection applies only if the timber, minerals or structures “are to be severed by the seller“. If the buyer is to sever, such transactions are considered contracts affecting land and all problems of the Statute of Frauds and of the recording of land rights apply to them. Therefore, the Statute of Frauds section of this Article does not apply to such contracts though they must conform to the Statute of Frauds affecting the transfer of interests in land.</text>
    <text type="Uniform Commercial Code Comment">2. Subsection (2). “Things attached” to the realty which can be severed without material harm are goods within this Article regardless of who is to effect the severance. The word “fixtures” has been avoided because of the diverse definitions of this term, the test of “severance without material harm” being substituted.</text>
    <text type="Uniform Commercial Code Comment">The provision in subsection (3) for recording such contracts in within the purview of this Article since it is a means of preserving the buyer’s rights under the contract of sale.</text>
    <text type="Uniform Commercial Code Comment">3. The security phases of things attached to or to become attached to realty are dealt with in the Article on Secured Transactions (Article 9) and it is to be noted that the definition of goods in that Article differs from the definition of goods in this Article.</text>

    <text type="Uniform Commercial Code Comment">Reason for 1972 Change [Laws 1977, Ch. 452]</text>
    <text type="Uniform Commercial Code Comment">Several timber-growing states have changed the 1962 Code to make timber to be cut under a contract of severance goods, regardless of the question who is to sever them. The section is revised to adopt this change. Financing of the transaction is facilitated if the timber is treated as goods instead of real estate. A similar change is made in the definition of “goods” in  Section 9-105. To protect persons dealing with timberlands, filing on timber to be cut is required in Part 4 of Article 9 to be made in real estate records in a manner comparable to fixture filing.</text>
