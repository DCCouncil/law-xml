    <text type="Uniform Commercial Code Comment">3. “Control” of Commodity Contracts. This section, as did former  Section 9-115(1)(e), contains provisions relating to control of commodity contracts which are analogous to those in  Section 8-106 for other types of investment property.</text>
    <text type="Uniform Commercial Code Comment">4. Securities Accounts and Commodity Accounts. For drafting convenience, control with respect to a securities account or commodity account is defined in terms of obtaining control over the security entitlements or commodity contracts. Of course, an agreement that provides that (without further consent of the debtor) the securities intermediary or commodity intermediary will honor instructions from the secured party concerning a securities account or commodity account described as such is sufficient. Such an agreement necessarily implies that the intermediary will honor instructions concerning all security entitlements or commodity contracts carried in the account and thus affords the secured party control of all the security entitlements or commodity contracts.</text>
