  <heading>Insecurity: adequate assurance of performance.</heading>
  <para>
    <num>(a)</num>
    <text>A lease contract imposes an obligation on each party that the other’s expectation of receiving due performance will not be impaired.</text>
  </para>
  <para>
    <num>(b)</num>
    <text>If reasonable grounds for insecurity arise with respect to the performance of either party, the insecure party may demand in writing adequate assurance of due performance. Until the insecure party receives that assurance, if commercially reasonable the insecure party may suspend any performance for which he or she has not already received the agreed return.</text>
  </para>
  <para>
    <num>(c)</num>

  </para>
  <para>
    <num>(d)</num>

    <text type="Uniform Commercial Code Comment"><strong>Changes:</strong> Revised to reflect leasing practices and terminology. Note that in the analogue to subsection (3) ( Section 2-609(4)), the adjective “justified” modifies demand. The adjective was deleted here as unnecessary, implying no substantive change.</text>
