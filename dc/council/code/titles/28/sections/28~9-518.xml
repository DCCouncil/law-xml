    <text type="Uniform Commercial Code Comment">2. Correction Statements. Former Article 9 did not afford a nonjudicial means for a debtor to correct a financing statement or other record that was inaccurate or wrongfully filed. Subsection (a) affords the debtor the right to file a correction statement. Among other requirements, the correction statement must provide the basis for the debtor’s belief that the public record should be corrected. See subsection (b). These provisions, which resemble the analogous remedy in the Fair Credit Reporting Act,  15 U.S.C. § 1681i, afford an aggrieved person the opportunity to state its position on the public record. They do not permit an aggrieved person to change the legal effect of the public record. Thus, although a filed correction statement becomes part of the “financing statement,“ as defined in  Section 9-102, the filing does not affect the effectiveness of the initial financing statement or any other filed record. See subsection (c).</text>
    <text type="Uniform Commercial Code Comment">This section does not displace other provisions of this Article that impose liability for making unauthorized filings or failing to file or send a termination statement (see  Section 9-625(e)), nor does it displace any available judicial remedies.</text>
    <text type="Uniform Commercial Code Comment">3. Resort to Other Law. This Article cannot provide a satisfactory or complete solution to problems caused by misuse of the public records. The problem of “bogus” filings is not limited to the UCC filing system but extends to the real-property records, as well. A summary judicial procedure for correcting the public record and criminal penalties for those who misuse the filing and recording systems are likely to be more effective and put less strain on the filing system than provisions authorizing or requiring action by filing and recording offices.</text>
