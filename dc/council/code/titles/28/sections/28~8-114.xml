  <para>
    <num>(1)</num>
    <text>Unless specifically denied in the pleadings, each signature on a security certificate or in a necessary indorsement is admitted.</text>
  </para>
  <para>
    <num>(2)</num>
    <text>If the effectiveness of a signature is put in issue, the burden of establishing effectiveness is on the party claiming under the signature, but the signature is presumed to be genuine or authorized.</text>
  </para>
  <para>
    <num>(3)</num>
    <text>If signatures on a security certificate are admitted or established, production of the certificate entitles a holder to recover on it unless the defendant establishes a defense or a defect going to the validity of the security.</text>
  </para>
  <para>
    <num>(4)</num>

    <text type="Uniform Commercial Code Comment">This section adapts the rules of negotiable instruments law concerning procedure in actions on instruments, see  Section 3-308, to actions on certificated securities governed by this Article. An “action on a security” includes any action or proceeding brought against the issuer to enforce a right or interest that is part of the security, such as an action to collect principal or interest or a dividend, or to establish a right to vote or to receive a new security under an exchange offer or plan of reorganization. This section applies only to certificated securities; actions on uncertificated securities are governed by general evidentiary principles.</text>
