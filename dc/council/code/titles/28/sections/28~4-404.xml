    <text type="Uniform Commercial Code Comment">This section incorporates a type of statute that had been adopted in 26 jurisdictions before the Code. The time limit is set at six months because banking and commercial practice regards a check outstanding for longer than that period as stale, and a bank will normally not pay such a check without consulting the depositor. It is therefore not required to do so, but is given the option to pay because it may be in a position to know, as in the case of dividend checks, that the drawer wants payment made.</text>
    <text type="Uniform Commercial Code Comment">Certified checks are excluded from the section because they are the primary obligation of the certifying bank ( Sections 3-409 and  3-413). The obligation runs directly to the holder of the check. The customer’s account was presumably charged when the check was certified.</text>
