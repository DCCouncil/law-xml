    <annotation type="Editor's Notes">Former § <cite path="§28:7-105">28:7-105</cite>, concerning construction against negative implication, was derived from Dec. 30, 1963, 77 Stat. 719, Pub. L. 88-243, § 1. The 2013 revision of this article deleted former § <cite path="§28:7-105">28:7-105</cite>, a statute that provided that courts could apply a rule from Parts 2 and 3 by analogy to a situation not explicitly covered in the provisions on warehouse receipts or bills of lading when it was appropriate. Per the official commentary appearing under § <cite path="§28:7-101">28:7-101</cite>: “this is, of course, an unexceptional proposition and need not be stated explicitly in the statute. Thus former  Section 7-105 has been deleted. Whether applying a rule by analogy to a situation is appropriate depends upon the facts of each case.”</annotation>

    <text type="Uniform Commercial Code Comment"><strong>Purpose:</strong> 1. This section allows for documents of title issued in one medium to be reissued in another medium. This section applies to both negotiable and nonnegotiable documents. This section sets forth minimum requirements for giving the reissued document effect and validity. The issuer is not required to issue a document in an alternative medium and if the issuer chooses to do so, it may impose additional requirements. Because a document of title imposes obligations on the issuer of the document, it is imperative for the issuer to be the one who issues the substitute document in order for the substitute document to be effective and valid.</text>
    <text type="Uniform Commercial Code Comment">2. The request must be made to the issuer by the person entitled to enforce the document of title ( Section 7-102(a)(9)) and that person must surrender possession or control of the original document to the issuer. The reissued document must have a notation that it has been issued as a substitute for the original document. These minimum requirements must be met in order to give the substitute document effect and validity. If these minimum requirements are not met for issuance of a substitute document of title, the original document of title continues to be effective and valid.  Section 7-402. However, if the minimum requirements imposed by this section are met, in addition to any other requirements that the issuer may impose, the substitute document will be the document that is effective and valid.</text>
    <text type="Uniform Commercial Code Comment">3. To protect parties who subsequently take the substitute document of title, the person who procured issuance of the substitute document warrants that it was a person entitled under the original document at the time it surrendered possession or control of the original document to the issuer. This warranty is modeled after the warranty found in  Section 4-209.</text>
