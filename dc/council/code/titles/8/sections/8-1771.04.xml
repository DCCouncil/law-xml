  <heading>New and revised standards.</heading>
  <text>The Mayor may adopt rules to establish increased efficiency standards for the products listed in § <cite path="§8-1771.02">8-1771.02</cite> or efficiency standards for products not specifically listed in § <cite path="§8-1771.02">8-1771.02</cite> if he or she determines that increased efficiency standards would serve to promote energy conservation in the District of Columbia; provided, that no new or increased efficiency standards shall become effective in less than one year following the adoption of the rule establishing the efficiency standard; provided further, that a substantially identical standard shall have been adopted by statute or regulation in Maryland or Virginia. The Mayor may apply for a waiver of federal preemption in accordance with federal procedures under section 325 of the Energy Policy and Conservation Act, approved December 22, 1975 (89 Stat. 923; 42 U.S.C. § 6295  ), for state efficiency standards for any product regulated by the federal government.</text>
