      <text>The procedures that DDOE shall use to establish and approve site or property-specific standard based on the assessments of health and environmental risks at a property. The standards may rely on engineering or institutional controls protective of public health, welfare and the environment. DDOE may designate and publish the particular engineering controls it deems as protective of public health, welfare and the environment in specified circumstances; and may designate the circumstances as containing presumptive remedies, taking into account the type of hazardous substances on the contaminated property and the proposed use of the property. Applicants claiming presumptive remedies shall not be required to conduct a risk assessment prior to the approval of a cleanup action plan.</text>
