    <text>If an application for a renewal license, along with a license renewal fee of $200, has been filed with the Superintendent [Commissioner] at least 30 days before the expiration of the license in force, such license shall continue in full force and effect either until the issuance by the Superintendent [Commissioner] of the renewal license applied for or until 5 days after the Superintendent [Commissioner] has refused to issue the renewal license and has given notice of such refusal to the applicant.  Except for the fee, the requirements for the issuance of a renewal license shall be the same as the requirements for the issuance of the initial license.  If the Superintendent [Commissioner] denies the applicant the authority to operate at a particular location, the operation of business at that particular location shall cease 5 days after the Superintendent [Commissioner] has refused to issue a renewal license to cover the location and has given notice of such refusal to the applicant.</text>
