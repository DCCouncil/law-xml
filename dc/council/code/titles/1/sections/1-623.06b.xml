The term  “earnings” also includes commissions, bonuses, and the  cash value of all payments and benefits received in any form other  than cash. Commissions and bonuses earned before disability but received  during the time the employee is receiving workers’ compensation  benefits do not constitute earnings that must be reported.</text>
