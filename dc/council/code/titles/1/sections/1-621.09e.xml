    <text>The Office of the Chief Financial Officer shall engage an independent qualified public accountant to conduct an annual audit of the Fund in accordance with generally accepted auditing standards. The examination shall involve such tests of the books and records of the Fund as are considered necessary by the accountant.

The opinion by the independent qualified public accountant shall be made a part of the annual report required pursuant to §  1-621.09f. In offering the opinion, the accountant may rely on the correctness of any actuarial matter certified to by an enrolled actuary if the accountant so states this reliance.</text>
