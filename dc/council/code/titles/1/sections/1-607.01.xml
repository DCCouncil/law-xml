  <para>
    <num>(c)</num>
    <text>If an employee’s religious beliefs require the employee to take time off from work during certain periods of the workday or workweek, the employee may elect to make up the time off, rather than to charge the time off to leave, in accordance with the procedures established under subsections (d) and (e) of this section.</text>

    <num>(d)</num>
    <text>An employee who makes an election pursuant to subsection (c) of this section shall, if the need to take time off is foreseeable, request an adjustment of his or her work schedule and obtain supervisory approval of the adjustment at least 10 days before taking time off from work. A request to adjust a work schedule may be disapproved if it is demonstrated that the adjustment would clearly interfere with the efficient conduct of the activities of the entity of the District government for which the employee works.</text>
