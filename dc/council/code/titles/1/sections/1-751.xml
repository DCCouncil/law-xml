    <heading>Filing of claim for benefits. —</heading>
    <text>For the purposes of this section, a claim is a request for a benefit by a participant or beneficiary of any of the Funds. A claim is filed when the procedure established by the Board for the initiation of claims has been met. Until such procedure has been established, a claim shall be deemed filed when a written communication is made by a claimant (or the claimant’s authorized representative) which is reasonably calculated to bring the claim to the attention of the Board and the written communication is received by the Board.</text>

    <para>
      <num>(3)</num>
      <text>If written notice of the denial of a claim is not furnished in accordance with paragraph (2) of this subsection within a reasonable time, the claimant shall be deemed to have exhausted his or her administrative remedies for the purpose of instituting proceedings for relief in the Superior Court for the District of Columbia, unless the claimant chooses to avail himself or herself of the procedures set forth in subsection (d) of this section.</text>

      <text>For the purposes of paragraphs (2) and (3) of this subsection, a reasonable period of time shall be no more than 90 calendar days after receipt of the claim by the Board, unless special circumstances require an extension of time for processing the claim. If such an extension of time for processing is required, written notice of the extension shall be furnished to the claimant prior to the termination of the initial 90-calendar-day period. In no event shall such extension exceed a period of 90 calendar days from the end of such initial period. The written notice of extension shall indicate the special circumstances requiring an extension of time and the date by which the Board expects to render the final decision.</text>

    <heading>Review. —</heading>

      <num>(1)</num>
      <text>The Board shall establish and maintain a procedure for each Fund, by which a claimant or his or her duly authorized representative has reasonable opportunity to appeal a denied claim to the Board, and under which full and fair review of the claim and its denial may be obtained. Every such procedure shall include, but not be limited to, provisions that permit a claimant or his or her duly authorized representative to:</text>

        <text>Request a review upon written application to the Board;</text>

        <text>Submit issues and comments in writing.</text>
      </para>
    </para>
    <para>
      <num>(2)</num>
      <text>Such procedures may establish a limited period within which a claimant must file any request for review of a denial claim. Such time limits must be reasonable and related to the nature of the benefit which is the subject of the claim and to other attendant circumstances. In no event may such a period expire less than 60 calendar days after receipt by the claimant or written notification of the denial of a claim.</text>

      <text>A decision by the Board or his or her designees shall be made no later than 90 calendar days after the Board’s receipt of a request for review, unless special circumstances require an extension of time for processing, in which case a decision shall be rendered as soon as possible, but not later than 120 calendar days after receipt of a request for review. If such an extension of time for review is required because of special circumstances, written notice of the extension shall be furnished to the claimant prior to the commencement of the extension.</text>
    </para>
    <para>
      <num>(4)</num>
      <text>The decision on review shall be in writing and shall be written in a manner calculated to be understood by the claimant.

    <heading>Reasonableness. —</heading>
