Code, sec. 1-299.4(c) [§ 1-315.04]).</text>

    <annotation type="Mayor's Statement">
      <text>The Unclaimed Property Unit of the Audit, Compliance and Investigation Administration of the Department of Finance and Revenue is responsible for the collection and maintenance of all abandoned tangible and intangible personal property reported and delivered to the Mayor for safekeeping and fiscal growth of the District of Columbia pursuant to the Uniform Disposition of Unclaimed Property Act of 1980, as amended, effective March 5, 1981 (D.C. Law 3-160; D.C. Code, sec. 42-201 [§ 41-101] et seq.). In addition, the Unclaimed Property Unit is required to attempt to locate and return the unclaimed property to the rightful owner.</text>
      <text>To date, the Unclaimed Property Unit has collected approximately $47 million and has returned approximately $4 million to the rightful owners. As a result, over $42 million have been contributed to the fiscal development of the District of Columbia since the creation of the program.</text>
      <text>I am committed to the most efficient operation of the District government. To this end, I submit herewith, Reorganization Plan No. 1 of 1992 that would transfer the functions of administering the District of Columbia's unclaimed property program from the Department of Finance and Revenue to the Office of the District of Columbia Controller within the Office of Financial Management. The Reorganization Plan would transfer the entire Unclaimed Property Unit, including its staff of seven persons, its property, records and funding to the Office of the District of Columbia Controller.</text>
      <text>To enhance the efficiency of the District government's operation, the reorganization would align the Unclaimed Property Unit with the Office of the District of Columbia Controller, the office within the District government that is responsible for the financial management of the District and that maintains the official accounts of the District.</text>
      <text>The Unit's current alignment within the Department of Finance and Revenue does not conform to the Department's general mission: tax administration. Although the unclaimed property program produces revenue for the District, it is not a tax program. Instead, it is more appropriately characterized first, as a financial management and fiduciary service which the District renders to persons who have abandoned their property within our jurisdiction and then second, as a program that generates revenue for the District. Consequently, it is more efficient to place the program in the office that is charged with the management and control of the District's financial affairs.

      <text>1 Only 12 other states in the country have their unclaimed property programs within their Departments of Finance and Revenue or Departments of Revenue, while 25 states administer their programs through their Treasury Departments or Controller's Offices.</text>
