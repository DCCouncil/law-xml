    <heading>Purpose for the Reorganization Plan</heading>
    <text>Pursuant to the Governmental Reorganization Procedures Act of 1981 this represents the Reorganization Plan for the Office of Risk Management (Plan). The Plan would establish the Office of Risk Management (Office), state the purpose of the Office, state the duties of the Chief Risk Officer and state the authority and functions of the Office.</text>
    <text>The Plan would transfer responsibility for the District of Columbia's public sector disability compensation program, public sector safety and health management program, claims for unliquidated damages filed against the District government and the risk management aspects affecting the safety and physical security of District government facilities to the newly established Office.</text>
    <text>The Plan would also provide for the Office to purchase insurance for the benefit of the District, place administration of the Settlements and Judgments Fund within the Office subject to the financial management of the District's Chief Financial Officer and repeal the authority of the Office of the Corporation Counsel [now Attorney General for the District of Columbia] to settle claims against the District of Columbia under Part III, A, subsections 1 and 2 of Reorganization Order 50, as amended (June 26, 1953). In addition, the Plan would establish a Risk Management Council and effectively repeal all reorganization plans and executive orders in conflict with the Plan.</text>
