    <text>The provisions of this section shall become effective on January 1, 1980, and shall apply to all employees, including employees described in § <cite path="§1-602.04">1-602.04</cite>, of a particular occupational group who are represented by a labor organization which has been granted exclusive recognition under this chapter by the Board. The determination of an appropriate unit for the purpose of negotiations concerning compensation shall not require a request from a labor organization. In determining appropriate bargaining units for negotiations concerning compensation, the Board shall authorize broad units of occupational groups so as to minimize the number of different pay systems or schemes. The Board may authorize bargaining by multiple employer or employee groups as may be appropriate.</text>
