    <annotation type="Change in Government">This section originated at a time when local government powers were delegated to a Board of Commissioners of the District of Columbia (see Acts Relating to the Establishment of the District of Columbia and its Various Forms of Governmental Organization in Volume 1). Section 401 of Reorganization Plan No. 3 of 1967 (see Reorganization Plans in Volume 1) transferred all of the functions of the Board of Commissioners under this section to a single Commissioner. The District of Columbia Self-Government and Governmental Reorganization Act, 87 Stat. 818, § 711 ( D.C. Code, § <cite path="§1-207.11">1-207.11</cite>), abolished the District of Columbia Council and the Office of Commissioner of the District of Columbia. These branches of government were replaced by the Council of the District of Columbia and the Office of Mayor of the District of Columbia, respectively. Accordingly, and also pursuant to § 714(a) of such Act ( D.C. Code, § <cite path="§1-207.14">1-207.14</cite>(a)), appropriate changes in terminology were made in this section.</annotation>
    <annotation type="Transfer of Functions">All functions of the Commissioner of Public Buildings and of the Commissioner of Public Roads were transferred to the Administrator of General Services, and the Public Roads Administration, to be known as the Bureau of Public Roads, was transferred to the General Services Administration by § 103(a) of the Act of June 30, 1949, 63 Stat. 380. The office of the Commissioner of Public Buildings was abolished by § 103(b) of that Act. The Bureau of Public Roads was transferred to the Department of Commerce to be administered by the Commissioner of Public Roads subject to the direction and control of the Secretary of Commerce under the provisions of 1949 Reorganization Plan No. 7, § 1, 14 F.R. 5228, 63 Stat. 1070. The Commissioner of Public Roads was redesignated the Federal Highway Administrator by the Act of August 3, 1956, 70 Stat. 990, ch. 937, § 2. Section 3(f)(4) of the Department of Transportation Act provided for the transfer of the office of Federal Highway Administrator to and continuation within the Department of Transportation under the title of Director of Public Roads. Section 3(e) of the same Act established within the Department of Transportation a Federal Highway Administration, headed by an Administrator. A Public Buildings Service, under the direction of a Commissioner, was established December 11, 1949, by the Administrator of General Services, to supersede the abolished Public Buildings Administration. All functions of all other officers of the Department of the Interior and all functions of all agencies and employees of such Department were, with 2 exceptions, transferred to the Secretary of the Interior, with power vested in him to authorize their performance or the performance of any of his functions by any of such officers, agencies, and employees, by 1950 Reorganization Plan No. 3, §§ 1 and 2, 15 F.R. 3174, 64 Stat. 1262.</annotation>
