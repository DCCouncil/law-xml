The CFO shall establish one or more separate tax increment allocation accounts within the General Fund of the District of Columbia for the deposit and application of Available Sales Tax Revenues and Available Real Property Tax Revenues from each TIF Area. Monies shall be transferred from such accounts at the times and in the amounts required pursuant to financing documents relating to any Bonds. Monies held or to be held in a tax allocation account may be used to (1) pay debt service on Bonds, (2) pay other costs due and payable under the applicable financing documents, and (3) to pay any other costs or expenses permitted by this subchapter. Monies in a tax allocation account or in any fund or account established under any financing documents may be pledged as security for the payment of debt service on Bonds.</text>
