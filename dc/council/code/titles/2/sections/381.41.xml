  <heading>New contracts with costs exceeding existing contracts.</heading>
  <text>The Mayor shall not enter into any new contract for goods or services the cost of which exceeds the cost of an existing contract for the same goods or services, when the current contractor is willing to continue to provide the goods or services at the price of the existing contract, as long as the contractor is providing satisfactory service; nor shall the Mayor extend any existing contract for any amount over the price agreed to in the existing contract. Nothing contained in this section shall prohibit the Mayor from putting a contract out for bid for a lower price.</text>
