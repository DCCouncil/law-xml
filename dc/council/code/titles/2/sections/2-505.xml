The publication or service required by this subsection of any notice shall be made not less than 30 days prior to the effective date of the proposed adoption, amendment, or repeal, as the case may be, except as otherwise provided by the Mayor or the agency upon good cause found and published with the notice.</text>

Any such emergency rule shall forthwith be published and filed in the manner prescribed in subchapter III of this chapter.
