The Board shall update each operating budget and supplement from time to time as the Board receives information requiring material changes to such operating budget or supplement. Operating budgets and supplements shall not require the prior approval of the members. Each operating budget and supplement shall be effective upon delivery to the members of record, or the later effective date set forth in the budget or supplement. For purposes of this section, a material change is a change where major programmatic activity not anticipated in a previously approved plan is undertaken or that involves a reallocation of more than 10% of the anticipated revenues in a budget year.</text>
