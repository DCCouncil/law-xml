The Mayor may from time to time adjust the rates of reimbursement for such care by issuing rules pursuant to subchapter I of Chapter 5 of Title 2, and by filing a copy of proposed rate changes with the Council of the District of Columbia at least 30 days before their effective date. The 30-day period for Council review shall not include days that pass during a recess of the Council. The rates of reimbursement under the D.C. Medical Charities program in effect for the fiscal year ending September 30, 1985, shall thereafter remain in effect until adjusted by the Mayor in accordance with this section.</text>
