    <text>The Interstate Commission shall promulgate reasonable rules to effectively and efficiently achieve the purposes of this compact. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if the Interstate Commission exercises its rulemaking authority in a manner that is beyond the scope of the purposes of this chapter or the powers granted pursuant to this chapter, then such exercise by the Interstate Commission shall be invalid and have no force or effect.</text>

The court shall give deference to the actions of the Interstate Commission consistent with applicable law and shall not find the rule to be unlawful if the rule represents a reasonable exercise of the Interstate Commission’s authority.</text>
