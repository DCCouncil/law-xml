    <text>Except as otherwise provided in this section or § <cite path="§50-1541.28">50-1541.28</cite>, a security interest in a vessel may be perfected only by delivery to the Harbor Master of an application for a certificate of title that identifies the secured party and otherwise complies with § <cite path="§50-1541.06">50-1541.06</cite>. The security interest is perfected on the later of delivery to the Harbor Master of the application and the applicable fee or attachment of the security interest under § <cite path="§28:9-203">28:9-203</cite>.</text>

    <text>If the interest of a person named as owner, lessor, consignor, or bailor in an application for a certificate of title delivered to the Harbor Master is a security interest, the application sufficiently identifies the person as a secured party. Identification on the application for a certificate of title of a person as owner, lessor, consignor, or bailor is not by itself a factor in determining whether the person’s interest is a security interest.</text>

    <text>If a secured party assigns a perfected security interest in a vessel, the receipt by the Harbor Master of a statement providing the name of the assignee as secured party shall not be required to continue the perfected status of the security interest against creditors of and transferees from the original debtor. A purchaser of a vessel subject to a security interest that obtains a release from the secured party indicated in the files of the Harbor Master or on the certificate of title takes free of the security interest and of the rights of a transferee unless the transfer is indicated in the files of the Harbor Master or on the certificate of title.</text>
