The guide shall list emission levels and average miles-per-gallon standards that will allow the District to achieve its taxicab fleet greenhouse gas reduction goal. The guide shall identify available funding sources and incentives for fuel-efficient and alternative-fuel vehicles. The Commission shall post the guide on its website and shall distribute the guide at no charge to taxicab operators. The Commission shall reevaluate and update the guide each year. The Commission may provide grants to owners of licensed taxicabs operating in the District to offset the cost of replacing an expired vehicle with an alternative-fuel vehicle as established by rulemaking. The Commission may issue rules and regulations to implement this section.”</annotation>
