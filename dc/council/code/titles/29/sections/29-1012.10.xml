    <text>Upon application by a dissolved limited cooperative association that has published a notice under § <cite path="§29-1012.09">29-1012.09</cite>, the Superior Court may determine the amount and form of security to be provided for payment of claims against the association that are contingent, have not been made known to the association, or are based on an event occurring after the effective date of dissolution, but that, based on the facts known to the association, are reasonably anticipated to arise after the effective date of dissolution.
