  <heading>Perfection of rights; right to withdraw.</heading>
  <para>
    <num>(a)</num>
    <text>A shareholder that receives notice pursuant to § <cite path="§29-311.12">29-311.12</cite> and that wishes to exercise appraisal rights shall sign and return the form sent by the corporation and, in the case of certificated shares, deposit the shareholder’s certificates in accordance with the terms of the notice by the date referred to in the notice pursuant to § <cite path="§29-311.12">29-311.12</cite>(b)(2)(B). In addition, if applicable, the shareholder shall certify on the form whether the beneficial owner of such shares acquired beneficial ownership of the shares before the date required to be set forth in the notice pursuant to § <cite path="§29-311.12">29-311.12</cite>(b)(1). If a shareholder fails to make this certification, the corporation may elect to treat the shareholder’s shares as after-acquired shares under § <cite path="§29-311.15">29-311.15</cite>. Once a shareholder deposits that shareholder’s certificates or, in the case of uncertificated shares, returns the signed forms, that shareholder loses all rights as a shareholder, unless the shareholder withdraws pursuant to subsection (b).</text>

    <text>A shareholder that has complied with subsection (a) of this section may nevertheless decline to exercise appraisal rights and withdraw from the appraisal process by so notifying the corporation in writing by the date set forth in the appraisal notice pursuant to § <cite path="§29-311.12">29-311.12</cite>(b)(2)(E). A shareholder that fails to so withdraw from the appraisal process may not thereafter withdraw without the corporation’s written consent.</text>
