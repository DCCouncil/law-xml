  </para>
  <para>
    <num>(h)</num>
    <text>A partner that wrongfully dissociates before the expiration of a definite term or the completion of a particular undertaking shall not be entitled to payment of any portion of the buyout price until the expiration of the term or completion of the undertaking, unless the partner establishes to the satisfaction of the court that earlier payment will not cause undue hardship to the business of the partnership. A deferred payment shall be adequately secured and bear interest.</text>
  </para>
  <para>
    <num>(i)</num>
    <text>A dissociated partner may maintain an action against the partnership, pursuant to § <cite root="29-604.05">29-604.05</cite>(b)(2)(B), to determine the buyout price of that partner’s interest, any offsets under subsection (c) of this section, or other terms of the obligation to purchase. The action shall be commenced within 120 days after the partnership has tendered payment or an offer to pay or within one year after written demand for payment if no payment or offer to pay is tendered. The court shall determine the buyout price of the dissociated partner’s interest, any offset due under subsection (c) of this section, and accrued interest, and enter judgment for any additional payment or refund. If deferred payment is authorized under subsection (h) of this section, the court shall also determine the security for payment and other terms of the obligation to purchase. The court may assess reasonable attorneys’ fees and the fees and expenses of appraisers or other experts for a party to the action, in amounts the court finds equitable, against a party that the court finds acted arbitrarily, vexatiously, or not in good faith. The finding may be based on the partnership’s failure to tender payment or an offer to pay or to comply with subsection (g) of this section.</text>
