    <text>If it appears to the court that the best interests of creditors, policyholders, and the public so require, the court may issue an order to liquidate in whatever terms it shall deem appropriate. The filing or recording of the order with the Clerk of the Superior Court of the District of Columbia or the recorder of deeds of the District of Columbia shall impart the same notice as a deed, bill of sale, or other evidence of title duly filed or recorded with that recorder of deeds would have imparted.</text>
