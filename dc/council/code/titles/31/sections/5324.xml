The authority of the societies and all societies hereafter licensed, may thereafter be renewed annually, but in all cases to terminate on the succeeding March 1.

For each such license or renewal the society shall pay the Commissioner a fee of $50. A duly certified copy or duplicate of the license shall be prima facie evidence that the licensee is a fraternal benefit society within the meaning of this chapter.</text>
