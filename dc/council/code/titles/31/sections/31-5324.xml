The authority of the societies and all societies hereafter licensed, may thereafter be renewed annually, but in all cases to terminate on the succeeding March 1. However, a license so issued shall continue in full force and effect until a renewal of the license has been specifically refused.  For each such license or renewal the society shall pay the Commissioner a fee of $50. A duly certified copy or duplicate of the license shall be prima facie evidence that the licensee is a fraternal benefit society within the meaning of this chapter.</text>
