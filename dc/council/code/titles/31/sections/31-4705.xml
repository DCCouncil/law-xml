In the case of contracts issued prior to the operative date of § <cite path="§31-4705.03">31-4705.03</cite>, such option shall provide that if the contract, after having been in force for 3 full years, shall, by its terms, lapse or become forfeited because any stipulated payment to the company shall not have been made, the reserve on such contract, computed according to the standard adopted by said company in accordance with this chapter, shall, after deducting one fifth of the said entire reserve, and any indebtedness to the company under the contract, be applied as a net single payment, according to said standard, for the purchase of a paid-up annuity or pure endowment contract, which may be nonparticipating and which shall be payable by the company under the same terms and conditions, except as to amount, as the original contract. For contracts issued prior to the operative date of § <cite path="§31-4705.03">31-4705.03</cite>, a company may provide, in lieu of such paid-up values, for a paid-up annuity or pure endowment contract in an amount bearing the same proportion to the original annuity or pure endowment contract as the number of stipulated payments which shall have been made to the company shall bear to the total number of stipulated payments required to be made to the company under the contract, and if there be any indebtedness to the company under the contract, the amount of such paid-up annuity or pure endowment shall be reduced by an amount bearing the same proportion to such paid-up annuity or pure endowment as such indebtedness bears to the reserve on such paid-up annuity or pure endowment, computed according to the standard adopted by said company in accordance with this chapter; and</text>
