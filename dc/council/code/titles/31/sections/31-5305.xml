  <para>
    <num>(c)</num>
    <text>A society may indemnify or reimburse a person in relation to any matter specified in subsection (b)(1) and (2) of this section if the person acted in good faith for a purpose the person reasonably believed to be in or not opposed to the best interests of the society and, in a criminal action or proceeding, in addition, had no reasonable cause to believe that his or her conduct was unlawful.  The determination whether the conduct of the person met the standard required in order to justify indemnification and reimbursement in relation to any matter described in subsection (b)(1) and (2) of this section may only be made by the supreme governing body or board of directors by a majority vote of a quorum consisting of persons who were not parties to the action, lawsuit, or proceeding or by a court of competent jurisdiction. The termination of any action, lawsuit, or proceeding by judgment, order, settlement, conviction, or upon a plea of no contest, as to the person shall not in itself create a conclusive presumption that the person did not meet the standard of conduct required in order to justify indemnification and reimbursement.</text>
