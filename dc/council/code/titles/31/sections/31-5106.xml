    <text>If a debtor makes a separate payment for credit life or credit accident and health insurance and an individual policy or certificate of insurance is not delivered to the debtor at the time the indebtedness is incurred, a copy of the application for such policy or a notice of proposed insurance shall be delivered at such time to the debtor by the creditor. The copy of the application for or notice of proposed insurance shall be signed by the debtor and shall set forth the identity by name or otherwise of the person insured; the rate or amount of payment by the debtor separately for credit life insurance and credit accident and health insurance; and a statement that within 30 days, if the insurance is accepted by the insurance company, there will be delivered to the debtor an individual policy or certificate of insurance containing the name and home office address of the insurance company, and a description of the amount, term, and coverage including any exceptions, limitations, and restrictions. The copy of the application for, or notice of, proposed insurance shall refer exclusively to insurance coverage, and shall be separate and apart from the loan, sale, or other credit statement of account, instrument, or agreement unless the information required by this subsection is prominently set forth in such statement of account, instrument, or agreement. If a debtor does not make a separate payment for credit life or credit accident and health insurance, an application need not be taken or a notice of proposed insurance given. In any case, upon acceptance of the insurance by the insurance company, and within 30 days of the date upon which the term of the insurance commences, the insurance company shall cause the individual policy or certificate of insurance to be delivered to the debtor. Said application or notice of proposed insurance shall state that, upon acceptance by the insurance company, the insurance shall become effective as provided in § <cite path="§31-5105">31-5105</cite>.</text>
