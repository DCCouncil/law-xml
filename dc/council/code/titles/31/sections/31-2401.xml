    <text>The Council of the District of Columbia finds that:</text>
    <para>
      <num>(1)</num>
      <text>Motorists, motor vehicle passengers, and pedestrians in the District are not adequately protected, by current law and practice, from the consequences of motor vehicle accidents.</text>

      <text>If a person suffers personal injuries because of an accident involving a motor vehicle in the District, he or she is unlikely to recover the amount of his or her actual losses because:</text>
      <para>
        <num>(A)</num>
        <text>Approximately 50% of the victims do not satisfy the prerequisites to compensation under the present law;</text>
      </para>
      <para>
        <num>(B)</num>
        <text>Approximately 40% of the operators in the District do not maintain any motor vehicle insurance or have other financial resources sufficient to pay losses;</text>
      </para>
      <para>
        <num>(C)</num>
        <text>The average motor vehicle insurance policy in the District will pay only up to $10,000 for the personal injuries of any 1 victim, a sum that is insufficient to compensate adequately a victim with serious injuries; and</text>
      </para>
      <para>
        <num>(D)</num>
        <text>Satisfaction of the prerequisites to compensation under the present law is time-consuming and expensive to policyholders because a victim must establish that the accident was the fault of another person; that the person injured was free from contributory fault; and that the injuries suffered were the natural and probable consequences of the accident.</text>

      <text>Far greater protection to victims of motor vehicle accidents is available at a lower price than that afforded for coverage currently available.</text>

    <para>
      <num>(4)</num>
      <text>The purchase of this better insurance protection should be compulsory because of the great potential of a motor vehicle to cause personal injury.</text>
