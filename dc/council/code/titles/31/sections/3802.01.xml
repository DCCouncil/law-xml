      <text>Purpose of Law 11-241</text>
      <text>Section 2 of <cite doc="D.C. Law 11-241">D.C. Law 11-241</cite> provided:</text>
      <text>“(a) The Council of the District of Columbia finds that:</text>
      <text>“(1) Phenylketonuria (”PKU“) is a cause of severe mental retardation that can be prevented if diagnosed within the first 3 weeks of childbirth.</text>
      <text>“(2) The District’s statutes and regulations direct the screening of newborn infants for hereditary and congenital disorders in the hospital prior to discharge.</text>
      <text>“(3) Hospital stays of less than 24 hours after childbirth typically result in unsatisfactory PKU specimens as a result of insufficient milk feedings.</text>
      <text>“(4) Insurers, both indemnity and managed care plans, have implemented benefit plans covering no more than 24 hours of postpartum stay in a hospital, despite little or no scientific support for the efficacy of this policy for the general population.</text>
      <text>“(5) The Guidelines for Perinatal Care, prepared by the American Academy of Pediatrics and the American College of Obstetrics and Gynecology, recommends a hospital stay of at least 48 hours after childbirth.</text>
      <text>“(b) In the interest of maximizing the prevention of mental retardation from PKU and other hereditary and congenital disorders, the Council of the District of Columbia hereby establishes a policy to require all individual and group health insurance policies to provide coverage for a minimum hospital stay for a mother and child following the birth of a child.”</text>
