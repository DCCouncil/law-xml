    <text>Every advance premium paid by an industrial life or industrial sick-benefit policyholder shall be recorded in the receipt book of the insured in exactly the same manner as current premiums are recorded, and accurate entry thereof shall be made in the record book of the agent; provided, however, that failure so to do shall not invalidate the policy.</text>
