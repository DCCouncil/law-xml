    <text>A Monte Carlo night party means an event for raising funds for charitable purposes at which wagers are made, through the use of imitation money presented to a participant in exchange for a donation to the event, in games of chance customarily associated with a gambling casino and at which a participant may use any accumulated imitation money to purchase prizes at the end of the event. The term “Las Vegas night party” may also be used to describe this type of event.</text>
