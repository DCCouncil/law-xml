      <text>Upon nonpayment of a delinquent account by the owner, agent, lessor, or manager of an apartment house who is billed directly by a company, electricity supplier, or gas company (any of which shall be referred to as “company”) for service furnished to such apartment house, such company, or the tenants residing in the affected apartment house, may petition the Superior Court of the District of Columbia for appointment of a receiver of the rents or payments for use and occupancy for such apartment house. The Chief Judge of the Superior Court or such Judge’s designee, upon presentation by the petitioner of a verified petition indicating such nonpayment of a delinquent account, shall immediately issue an order requiring such owner, agent, lessor, or manager, as respondent, to show cause why a receiver should not be appointed.</text>

      <text>A hearing on the show cause order shall be held no later than 72 hours after its issuance or the first court day thereafter. Upon a prima facie showing by affidavit, testimony or otherwise, that delinquent electric company, electricity supplier, gas company, or natural gas supplier bills on the subject apartment house remain unpaid, the Court shall forthwith appoint a receiver to collect rents or payments for use and occupancy from the tenants thereof and to pay current electric company, electricity supplier, or gas company bills as hereinafter required. Prior to said hearing, respondent may file an answer to the petition raising such grounds of defense as respondent may have; except, that any set-offs, counterclaims, or third-party claims shall not be grounds for refusing to appoint a receiver.</text>

      <text>The receiver appointed by the Court shall have the authority to take such action as it deems necessary to collect all rents or payments for use and occupancy from the tenants of the apartment house in question in place of the owner, agent, lessor or manager. Any monies remaining after such payments, fees and costs shall be turned over to the owner, agent, lessor, or manager. The receiver shall pay the electric company, electricity supplier, gas company, or natural gas supplier from the rents and payments for services provided the company on and after the date of his appointment. The owner, agent, lessor, or manager shall be liable for the reasonable fees and costs determined by the Court to be due the receiver, which fees and costs may be recovered from the rents or payments for use and occupancy under the control of the receiver; provided, that no fees or costs shall be turned over until after payment of current electric company, electricity supplier, gas company, or natural gas supplier on the apartment house has been made. Any monies remaining after such payments, fees and costs shall be turned over to the owner, agent, lessor, or manager. Upon order of the Court, the receiver shall become trustee of any escrow accounts or other funds established by the tenants or otherwise into which rents or payments for use and occupancy have been paid or are being held. The Court shall require accountings to be made by the receiver at such times as the Court determines to be just, reasonable and necessary.</text>
