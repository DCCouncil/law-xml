If a hearing has been held on the petition, and the Rent Administrator, by order served upon the parties at least 10 days prior to the expiration of 90 days, makes a provisional finding as to the rent charged adjustment justified by the petition, the housing provider may implement only the amount of the rent charged adjustment authorized by the order. Except to the extent modified by this subsection, the provisions of § <cite path="§42-3502.16">42-3502.16</cite> shall apply to any adjustment under this section.</text>
