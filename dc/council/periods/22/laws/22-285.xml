      <summary>Law 22-285 requires that the Department of Health (DOH) install drop boxes for the disposal of expired or unused controlled substances at law enforcement agencies, retail pharmacies and hospitals with an on-site pharmacy. It identifies which controlled substances a person may voluntarily surrender without identifying themselves. In coordination with the Deputy Mayor for Public Safety and Justice, DOH must also maintain a list of  the locations of collection receptacles, and coordinate with the Metropolitan Police Department and authorized collectors regarding the destruction of the contents of collection receptacles.  </summary>
