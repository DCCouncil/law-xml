      <summary>Non-traditional child care is a service offered to parents whose work schedule is outside of the standard hours of 7 am to 6 pm, Monday through Friday. Law 22-11 requires OSSE to conduct a study to evaluate the sufficiency of the number of non-traditional child care facilities. The evaluation must include the total number of current non-traditional facilities operating in the District, the current level of service being provided, the current need for non-traditional facilities, and recommendations. It also requires OSSE to assess the impact of increased education requirements for staff members as well as coordinate the sharing of necessary information with the Department of Employment Services.</summary>
