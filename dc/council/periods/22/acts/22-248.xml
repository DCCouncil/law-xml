      <summary>BILL SUMMARY - As introduced, this bill clarifies which accident and traffic data the Mayor will report to the Council and when an all-terrain vehicle or dirt bike may occupy public space in the District. The bill also specifies that the presence of workers is unnecessary for a moving violation to double. </summary>
