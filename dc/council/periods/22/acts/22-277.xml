      <summary>BILL SUMMARY - As introduced, this bill removes the requirement that persons with intellectual disabilities who are supported by the Department of Disability Services (DDS) be civilly committed in order to receive residential services. It repeals and amends existing law to bar new civil commitments of persons with intellectual disabilities. Persons who are already civilly committed will also have their commitments terminated unless that person or his or decision maker provides informed consent to the commitment at annual hearings. The bill also requires DDS to work with DC Superior Court to end civil commitments and creates a legal framework to facilitate the supported decision making that will replace civil commitments. Persons found incompetent to stand trial in a criminal case will continue to be civilly committed. </summary>
