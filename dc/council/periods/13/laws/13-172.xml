Early out retirement incentive a) Notwithstanding section 1106 of the District of Columbia Government Comprehensive Merit Personnel Act of 1978 CMPA the Council adopts changes to the Career and Excepted Service compensation system under section 1104 of the CMPA, that authorize the Mayor to establish a retirement incentive program for certain District employees b) The changes to the compensation system are as follows 1) The Mayor is authorized to establish an early out retirement incentive program (“Early Out Program”) which shall apply to eligible employees under the personnel authority of the Mayor, and employees of any other personnel authority that is under the pay authority of the Mayor, if the personnel authority chooses to participate in the Early Out Program 2) The Early Out Program may be implemented by the appropriate personnel authority at any time after the effective date of this act 3) The Early Out Program shall be limited to employees retiring under the voluntary early out retirement provisions of 5 U.S.C. § 8336(d)(2 4) The Early Out Program shall offer a retirement incentive of not more than 50% of an employee’s annual rate of basic pay from the employee’s salary or pay schedule which was in effect on April 9, 2000, not to exceed $25,000, to be paid within one year of the employee’s retirement 5) Retirement incentive payments shall be prorated in the case of a part-time employee 6) Retirement incentive payments shall not be considered basic pay for computing retirement entitlement, insurance entitlement, any category of premium pay entitlement, lump-sum leave, or any other entitlement that is computed on basic pay 7) No incentive payment shall be paid to A) An employee retiring under the law enforcement or firefighter provisions of 5 U.S.C. § 8336(c the discontinued service/involuntary retirement provisions of 5 U.S.C. § 8336(d)(1 or the disability retirement provisions of 5 U.S.C. § 8337 B) An employee who is a reemployed annuitant under the provisions of 5 U.S.C. § 8344 C) An employee who is in a critical position as defined by regulations promulgated by the Mayor D) An employee who is a sworn member of the Metropolitan Police Department or the Fire and Emergency Medical Services Department E) An employee who is under indictment or who is charged by information with or who has been convicted of a felony or who has been convicted after a plea of nolo contendere to a felony related to his or her employment duties; provided, that any employee who is ultimately acquitted or cleared of any charge that caused his or her ineligibility shall be eligible for all benefits as if that employee had never been indicted for or charged by information with a felony; or ENROLLED ORIGINAL 17 (F) An employee who, based on conduct related to his or her employment duties, has been convicted of a misdemeanor or who has plead guilty or has been convicted after a plea of nolo contendere to a misdemeanor; provided, that any employee who is ultimately acquitted or cleared of any charge that caused his or her ineligibility shall be eligible for all benefits as if that employee had never been charged with a misdemeanor 8) For the purposes of paragraph (7)(E) of this subsection, the term “felony” means an offense that is punishable by a term of imprisonment that exceeds one year or a fine of a least $1,000 9) An employee who receives an incentive payment under the Early Out Program shall not be eligible for reemployment with the District government for 5 years from the date of retirement, or hired or retained as a sole source consultant or personal services contractor for 5 years from the date of retirement. Sec. 304. Fiscal impact statement. Enactment of this title would have no negative fiscal impact upon the FY 2001 Budget and Financial Plan and could result in long-term savings from the elimination of positions. If the retirement incentives program is implemented in the first quarter of FY 2001, it can be self- funded through the savings derived from lapsed salaries, where positions are abolished or remain vacant during the remainder of the fiscal year. Sec. 305. Sunset provision. This title shall expire on December 31, 2000. TITLE IV. HISTORIC PRESERVATION REORGANIZATION AND AMENDMENTS Sec. 401. Short title. This title may be cited as the "Historic Preservation Reorganization and Amendment Act of 2000 Sec. 402 a) All positions, personnel, property, records, and unexpended balances of appropriations, allocations, and other funds available or to be made available to the Department of Consumer and Regulatory Affairs for the operation and implementation of the historic preservation functions of the Department of Consumer and Regulatory Affairs as set forth in section III(B)(8) of Reorganization Plan No. 1 of 1983, effective March 31, 1983, are hereby transferred to the Office of Planning, established pursuant to Mayor's Order 83-25, effective January 3, 1983 b) All of the functions assigned and authority delegated to the Department of Consumer and Regulatory Affairs concerning historic preservation as set forth in section III(B)(8) of Reorganization Plan No. 1 of 1983, effective March 31, 1983 are hereby transferred to the Office of Planning, established pursuant to Mayor's Order 83-25, effective January 3, 1983. ENROLLED ORIGINAL 18 Sec. 403. The Historic Landmark and Historic District Protection Act of 1978 is amended as follows a) Section 4(c)(5) is repealed b) Section 13 is amended as follows 1) Subsection (a) is amended as follows A) Strike the phrase "60 days" and insert the phrase "120 days" in its place B) Strike the phrase or the application shall be deemed approved by the Mayor 2) Subsection (b) is amended by striking the second and third sentences. Sec. 404. Fiscal impact statement. There would be no net difference to the District's overall budget by virtue of the transfer of the Historic Preservation Division from the Department of Consumer and Regulatory Affairs DCRA to the Office of Planning, as provided in section 402. The FY 2001 Budget includes the transfer of $768,081 and 9 FTEs from DCRA to the Office of Planning. Of this amount 524,902 is for personal expenses and $243,179 is for nonpersonal expenses. The amount for personal expenses includes provision for the compensation of $20,160 for members of the Historic Preservation Review Board.

The provisions being amended in the District's historic preservation law, which were first introduced by the Omnibus Regulatory Reform Act of 1998, have caused the District to incur undue and expensive legal argument and litigation expenses. By eliminating the "contested case" procedures from the designation of a historic landmark, the law would truly streamline a process which already relies heavily on experts other than attorneys and lessen the expense that would be caused by an overly legalistic approach to a matter that is best left to other professionals. Similarly, eliminating the automatic approval by the Mayor for an untimely opinion by the Mayor's Agent reduces the absurd and costly result that occurs when the Mayor's Agent finds against a "special merit" application which might be complicated and take longer to craft a considered opinion than the 60 days provided. Leaving this law as it currently stands would subject the District to unnecessary litigation and would serve to waste the Mayor's Agent's time and effort based on a technicality of unproven substance. The amendment therefore expands the time frame for rendering well-reasoned opinions to 120 days and eliminates an automatic approval if the Mayor's Agent fails to act within the prescribed time period. TITLE V. PUBLIC RIGHTS-OF-WAY FEES Sec. 501. Short title. This title may be cited as the "Public Rights-of-Way Occupancy Fees Amendment Act of 2000 Sec. 502. Chapter 33 of Title 24 of the District of Columbia Municipal Regulations (47 DCR 2353) is amended as follows a) Section 3302.8 is amended by striking the phrase 0.14 per linear foot" and inserting the phrase 0.88 per linear foot" in its place b) Section 3302.9 is amended by striking the phrase 0.33 per linear foot" and inserting the phrase 1.32 per linear foot" in its place c) Section 3302.10 is amended by striking the phrase 0.39 per square foot" and inserting the phrase 1.32 per square foot" in its place. Sec. 503. The amendments made by section 502 of this title to the public rights-of-way rental fees do not preclude the Mayor from further amending these same fees as authorized in section 604 of the Fiscal Year 1997 Budget Support Act of 1996 provided that the amended rates, when taken together with the other user fees, charges, and penalties collected pursuant to that section and D.C. Code § 47-2718 do not adversely impact the positive fiscal impact identified in section 506 of this title. ENROLLED ORIGINAL 20 Sec. 504. Section 604 of the Fiscal Year 1997 Budget Support Act of 1996 is amended as follows a) The first sentence of paragraph (4) is amended to read as follows Establish and regulate the process through which any impact, modification, or damage to the public space, public-rights-of-way, or public structures may be compensated, which may include the establishment of user fees, including impact and other direct-use fees, charges, and penalties b) A new paragraph (5) is added to read as follows The first $30 million dollars of annual revenue derived from the collection of the public rights-of-way user fees, charges, and penalties established pursuant to this section shall be dedicated to the Department of Public Works for expenditures related to street and alley repairs and maintenance that would otherwise be paid out of the General Fund. Any revenues in excess of $30 million annually from the collection of these public rights-of-way user fees, charges, and penalties shall be dedicated to the District of Columbia Highway Trust Fund Sec. 505 a) The Mayor's submission of proposed budgets to the Council beginning with the budget for fiscal year 2002 shall provide for all of the revenue derived from the collection of public rights-of-way occupancy fees to be dedicated to the District of Columbia Highway Trust fund and shall provide for any necessary adjustments to keep in balance the financial plan b) Subsection (a) of this section shall not be applicable to the extent that FY 2002 General Fund revenues are inadequate and revenues do not exceed projections as certified in conjunction with the Fiscal Year 2001 Budget Request Act. In this event, the Mayor shall include a detailed explanation with his submission of the FY 2002 budget to the Council. Sec. 506. Applicability. Section 502 of this title shall apply as of October 1, 2000. Sec. 507. Fiscal impact statement. The FY 2001 Budget and Financial Plan relies in part on increasing public rights-of-way user fees as proposed by this title. Enactment of this title is expected to generate not less than $23.3 million in additional revenue for FY 2001, beyond the originally estimated $6.7 million in revenue from the existing fee structure. Section 504 addresses the growing shortfall in District allocated funds for street and road repair. This section has no fiscal impact in FY 2001, however, in FY 2002 and beyond, section 504 would dedicate all rights of way fees to the trust fund. If the revenues are inadequate and revenues do not exceed projections as certified in conjunction with the FY 2001 Budget Request Act, section 504 requires that the Mayor include a detailed explanation with his submission of the fiscal year 2002 budget to the Council. ENROLLED ORIGINAL 21 TITLE VI. EMERGENCY AND NON-EMERGENCY NUMBER TELEPHONE SYSTEM ASSESSMENTS Sec. 601. Short title.

ENROLLED ORIGINAL 22 Sec. 603. Emergency and Non-Emergency Number Telephone Calling Systems Fund a) There is established a fund designated as the Emergency and Non-Emergency Number Telephone Calling Systems Fund, which shall be separate from the General Fund of the District of Columbia and shall be used solely for the purposes set forth in subsection (b) of this section. The Fund shall be funded by user fees imposed under section 604. All fees collected under section 604, and all interest earned on those fees, shall be deposited into the Fund without regard to fiscal year limitation pursuant to an act of Congress. All fees deposited into the Fund shall not revert to the General Fund of the District of Columbia at the end of any fiscal year or at any other time, but shall be continually available for the uses and purposes set forth in subsection (b) of this section, subject to authorization by Congress in an appropriations act b) The Fund shall be used solely to defray personnel and nonpersonnel costs incurred by the District of Columbia and its agencies and instrumentalities in providing a 911 system, and direct costs incurred by wireless carriers in providing wireless E-911 service. For purposes of this subsection, the term "costs" shall include obligations incurred both before and after the effective date of this act. The Fund shall not be used for any other purpose c) The Mayor shall submit to the Council, as a part of the annual budget, a requested appropriation for expenditures from the Fund. Any monies received but not expended in a given fiscal year shall be retained by the Fund d) All income and expenses of the Fund shall be audited annually by the Mayor. The audit report shall be provided to the Council. The expenses of each audit shall be defrayed by the Fund. Sec. 604. Assessments a)(1) All subscribers shall contribute to the Fund through a user fee to be collected by each local exchange carrier 2)(A) Subscribers to wireline local exchange service shall pay the following monthly user fees i) A fee of $0.56 per exchange access line; and (ii) A fee of $0.07 per Centrex line B) Subscribers to wireless local exchange service shall pay a monthly user fee of $0.56 for each telephone number that has a District of Columbia billing address b)(1) Each local exchange carrier shall collect the user fees imposed under subsection (a) of this section and shall remit the proceeds to the Mayor on a quarterly basis 2) Each local exchange carrier shall be entitled to deduct and retain an amount not to exceed 2% of the user fees collected to cover administrative costs c)(1) Payment of the user fees imposed under subsection (a) of this section shall not be subject to taxes or charges levied by the District of Columbia 2) User fees collected under subsection (a) of this section shall not be considered revenue of a local exchange carrier for any purpose d) As part of the annual request for appropriations from the Fund, the Mayor shall provide a report to the Council addressing whether the user fees imposed under subsection (a) of this section should be adjusted. ENROLLED ORIGINAL 23 (e) Each user fee imposed under this section shall be reflected in a separate line item on each bill sent by a local exchange carrier. Sec. 605. Removal of 911 system costs from base rates. The Commission shall direct Bell Atlantic Washington, D.C to remove the 911 charges currently embedded in the base rates charged by Bell Atlantic Washington, D.C for local exchange service and to revise its tariffs to reflect the removal of the 911 charge. Sec. 606. Repealer. The Emergency and Non-Emergency Number Telephone Calling Fund Act of 2000 is repealed. Sec. 607. Applicability. Except for section 606, this title shall apply as of October 1, 2000. Sec. 608. Fiscal impact statement. The FY 2001 Budget and Financial Plan relies in part on establishing new emergency and non-emergency telephone user fees as proposed by this title. Enactment of this title is expected to generate approximately $2.6 million in additional revenue in FY 2001, which will be dedicated to the personnel and non-personnel costs associated with the District government's operation of the emergency and non-emergency telephone calling system. As the amount purported to be collected by the 911-311 fee is at best an estimate, and Virginia in collecting its fee has incurred a sizable surplus, it is believed that allowing wireless carriers to recover their direct costs should not have an adverse effect on the District's ability to pay for the personnel and nonpersonnel costs incurred by the District and its agencies and instrumentalities in providing the 911 system service. TITLE VII. DCPS PROCUREMENT, PLANNING AND REPORTING REQUIREMENTS SUBTITLE A: BOARD OF EDUCATION INDEPENDENT PROCUREMENT AUTHORITY Sec. 701. Short title. This subtitle may be cited as the "Board of Education Independent Procurement Authority Amendment Act of 2000 Sec. 702. Section 104 of the District of Columbia Procurement Practices Act of 1985 is amended by adding a new subsection (d) to read as follows d) This act shall apply to the Board of Education, except that the Board of Education shall have the authority to solicit, award, and execute contracts independently of the Office of Contracting and Procurement and the Chief Procurement Officer ENROLLED ORIGINAL 24 Sec. 703. Section 14 of An Act To fix and regulate the salaries of teachers, school officers, and other employees of the Board of Education of the District of Columbia is amended by striking the last sentence. Sec. 704. Section 4 of An Act To provide books and educational supplies free of charge to pupils of the public schools of the District of Columbia is amended by striking the phrase through the Office of Contracting and Procurement Sec. 705. Section 1 of An Act To establish a Department of Food Services in the public schools of the District of Columbia, and for other purposes is amended by striking the last sentence. Sec. 706. Section 405(b) of the District of Columbia Public Postsecondary Education Reorganization Act is repealed. Sec. 707. Fiscal impact statement. This subtitle will not have a fiscal impact, because it will shift the procurement workload of the D.C. Public Schools DCPS from the Office of Contracting and Procurement to DCPS. Because of a concern that the pension benefits of DCPS' procurement employees could be jeopardized by transferring the staff to the Office of Contracting and Procurement, the transfer never took place and DCPS has 24 full-time equivalent procurement personnel. Therefore, DCPS has the resources needed to administer procurement internally. SUBTITLE B: PUBLIC SCHOOLS TITLE I EDUCATION REPORTING REQUIREMENTS Sec. 711. Short title. This subtitle may be cited as the "Public Schools Title I Reporting Requirement Act of 2000 Sec. 712. The District of Columbia Public Schools and the Superintendent of Schools shall each provide a written report to the Council by January 15, 2001, on the efficacy of expenditures made under Title I of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965. Sec. 713. Fiscal impact statement. There is no fiscal impact associated with this subtitle. No new staff are required to complete the report. ENROLLED ORIGINAL 25 SUBTITLE C: DEVELOPMENT OF ADA IMPROVEMENT PLAN FOR PUBLIC SCHOOLS Sec. 721. Short title. This subtitle may be cited as the "Public Schools Americans with Disabilities Plan Requirement Act of 2000 Sec. 722. The District of Columbia Public Schools shall develop a plan to implement improvements in accordance with the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 (“ADA”) by November 1, 2000, that describes the needs of schools and the actions that will be taken to make the ADA required improvements.

SUBTITLE D: COORDINATION OF MASTER FACILITIES PLAN WITH CAPITAL IMPROVEMENT PLAN Sec. 731. Short title. This subtitle may be cited as the "Master Facilities Plan Coordination Act of 2000 Sec. 732. The District of Columbia Public Schools shall facilitate and coordinate its capital improvement program with its Facilities Master Plan. Sec. 733. Fiscal impact statement. There is no fiscal impact associated with this subtitle. No new staff are required to complete the report. TITLE VIII. METROPOLITAN POLICE DEPARTMENT SUBTITLE A: METROPOLITAN POLICE EXCESS VEHICLE REVENUE Sec. 801. Short title. This subtitle may be cited as the “Metropolitan Police Excess Vehicle Revenue Act of 2000 Sec. 802. Proceeds from sales of excess police vehicles. Effective immediately, and notwithstanding any other provision of law, police vehicles purchased for the Metropolitan Police Department MPD which have been declared excess, either through age or mechanical faults, shall be auctioned, or otherwise disposed of by MPD. Revenue not to exceed $500,000 generated by auction or other means of disposal will be returned ENROLLED ORIGINAL 26 to MPD as Other Revenue, to be used expressly for the purchase of specialty replacement vehicles, including motorcycles. Any revenue in excess of $500,000 shall revert to the General Fund. Sec. 803. Fiscal impact statement. Enactment of this subtitle will have no negative fiscal impact, because the MPD has had access to vehicle auction proceeds in both fiscal years 1998 and 1999, and the approximately $200,000 in estimated annual revenue from these proceeds is not included in the general fund revenue estimates for FY 2000 and FY 2001. SUBTITLE B: OMNIBUS POLICE REFORM TECHNICAL AND CONFORMING AMENDMENTS Sec. 811. Short title. This subtitle may be cited as "Omnibus Police Reform Technical and Conforming Amendments Act of 2000 Sec. 812. The Omnibus Police Reform Amendment Act of 2000, signed by the Mayor on April 24, 2000 (D.C. Act 13-334; 47 DCR 4619 is amended as follows a) Section 102 is amended by striking the phrase "Lateral Appointment of Law Enforcement Officers Emergency Amendment Act of 2000" and inserting the phrase "Lateral Appointment of Law Enforcement Officers Clarifying Emergency Amendment Act of 1999" in its place both times it appears b) A new subsection (a-1) is added to read as follows a-1) Metropolitan Police Officers hired after January 11, 2000, and prior to December 31, 2003, shall have successfully completed at least 60 post-secondary semester hours from an accredited university by the fifth anniversary of the date hired Sec. 813. Fiscal impact statement. Enactment of this subtitle, which includes technical amendments to conform the permanent omnibus police reform legislation with the emergency and temporary versions of the legislation, has no fiscal impact. SUBTITLE C: POLICE PERSONNEL AMENDMENT Sec. 821. Short title. This subtitle may be cited as the "Metropolitan Police Personnel Amendment Act of 2000 Sec. 822. The District of Columbia Government Comprehensive Merit Personnel Act of 1978 is amended as follows a) Section 801 is amended by adding a new subsection (d-1) to read as follows: ENROLLED ORIGINAL 27 d-1) For members of the Metropolitan Police Department and notwithstanding section 3203(a)(2) or any other law or regulation, the Assistant and Deputy Chiefs of Police and inspectors shall be selected from among the captains of the force and shall be returned to the rank of captain when the Mayor so determines b) Section 3203(a) is amended as follows 1) Paragraph (28) is amended by striking the word "and" at the end 2) Paragraph (29) is amended by striking the period and inserting the phrase and" in its place 3) A new paragraph (30) is added to read as follows 30) Notwithstanding the provisions of paragraph (2) of this subsection or of any other law or regulation, for members of the Metropolitan Police Department, the Assistant and Deputy Chiefs of Police and inspectors shall be selected from among the captains of the force and shall be returned to the rank of captain when the Mayor so determines as provided in section 1 of An Act Relating to the Metropolitan police of the District of Columbia Sec. 823. Fiscal impact statement. This subtitle will have no negative fiscal impact and could have a positive impact due to the removal of administrative costs involved in adverse action proceedings from demoting persons in positions of Inspector and above. Administrative costs include witness fees, staff overtime for investigative work, and materials and supplies expenses. Enactment of this section, therefore, creates a cost avoidance from expenditure activity associated with adverse litigation. SUBTITLE D: POLICE CADET PROGRAM Sec. 831. Short title. This subtitle may be cited as the "Metropolitan Police Cadet Program Amendment Act of 2000 Sec. 832. Section 2(a) of the Police Officer and Firefighter Cadet Programs Funding Authorization and Human Rights Amendment Act of 1982 is amended to read as follows a) The Chief of the Metropolitan Police Department shall establish a police officer cadet program, which shall include senior year high school students and young adults under the 21 years of age residing in the District of Columbia who are graduates of a high school in the District, for the purpose of instructing, training, and exposing interested persons to the operations of the Metropolitan Police Department and the duties, tasks, and responsibilities of serving as a police officer with the Metropolitan Police Department Sec. 833.

Pursuant to this redeployment plan, a minimum of 60% of all sworn officers who are available for full duty would be assigned to the PSA system. For this purpose, these officers would be assigned to street patrol and available to respond to calls for service c) The requirement set forth in subsection (b) of this section does not preclude the Chief of Police from also submitting alternatives to the redeployment plan required by the Council. Sec. 843. Fiscal impact statement. This subtitle will have no fiscal impact because it does not propose an increase in the number of sworn officers, and MPD states that it is currently hiring civilians to fill jobs that have been targeted for civilianization in order to assign sworn officers to street patrol. TITLE IX. RODENT CONTROL Sec. 901. Short title. This title may be cited as the "Rodent Control Act of 2000 SUBTITLE A: BUREAU OF RODENT CONTROL Sec. 902.

District of Columbia Consumer Protection Fund a) Subject to appropriation and authorization by Congress, there is established the ENROLLED ORIGINAL 44 District of Columbia Consumer Protection Fund Fund to be operated as a proprietary fund with assets not to exceed $1,490,000 at any time.

Fiscal impact statement. This title extends the suspension of the enforcement of the District's consumer protection law, thereby avoiding a substantial negative fiscal impact (estimated to be approximately $546,000) that would occur if the Department of Consumer and Regulatory Affairs were required to renew this program which was first suspended in FY 1996. Instead, the title authorizes but does not require the Office of the Corporation Counsel to pursue consumer protection claims more aggressively, provides additional remedies and potential recovery on behalf of citizens and the District government, and establishes a District of Columbia Consumer Protection Fund into which increased fines and other monetary remedies would be deposited and dedicated for the purposes of consumer protection. The fund would be a non- lapsing proprietary fund, subject to appropriation and authorization by Congress, which would include assets not to exceed $1,490,000. Any balance in excess of $1,490,000 would be required to be deposited in the General Fund. The fines and other monetary remedies to be deposited in this newly established consumer protection fund are not included within the general fund revenue estimates for the FY 2001 Budget and Financial Plan and, therefore, this title will have no negative fiscal impact upon the budget or financial plan. TITLE XV. WATER AND SEWER REPAIRS Sec. 1501. Short title. This title may be cited as the "Water and Sewer Infrastructure Repair Responsibility Amendment Act of 2000 Sec. 1502.

Fiscal impact statement. This title will have no adverse impact upon the Fiscal Year 2001 Budget and Financial Plan. The title clarifies that the Water and Sewer Authority WASA bears the financial responsibility for repairing and maintaining its water service pipes and building sewer, including surface repairs, and repeals the statutory obligation of the Department of Public Works to use highway appropriations to fund public space surface repairs associated with WASA's repair and maintenance of its service pipes. Implementation of this title is estimated to generate the Department of Public Works approximately $107,000 in operating funds each year, which instead will be paid from the Water and Sewer Authority Enterprise Fund. TITLE XVI. SUBMISSION DATE FOR RESOLUTION OUTLINING USE OF MONIES IN TAXICAB COMMISSION FUND Sec. 1601. Short title. This title may be cited as the "Taxicab Assessment Fund Amendment Act of 2000 Sec. 1602.

Sec. 1603. Fiscal impact statement. This title simply changes a date within existing law that requires an annual submission of a report to the Council and, therefore, has no fiscal impact. TITLE XVII. CONTRACT APPEALS BOARD INTERAGENCY AGREEMENT AUTHORIZATION ENROLLED ORIGINAL 46 Sec. 1701. Short title. This title may be cited as the "Contract Appeals Board Interagency Agreement Authorization Amendment Act of 2000 Sec. 1702. The District of Columbia Procurement Practices Act of 1985 is amended as follows a) Section 901(c) is amended by adding a new paragraph (3) to read as follows 3) The Board shall use any fees received pursuant to section 903(b) at the discretion of the Chairperson to improve the Boards services and programs, including the option to provide incentive awards to Board personnel consistent with Subchapter XX of the District of Columbia Government Comprehensive Merit Personnel Act of 1978 b) Section 903(b) is amended to read as follows b) Jurisdiction of the Board shall be consistent with the coverage of this act as defined in sections 104 and 320, except that the Board shall have the authority to enter into fee-for- service agreements with agencies, departments, boards, commissions, and instrumentalities of the District or other public entities that are not subject to the Board's jurisdiction. The agreements shall provide for the Board to resolve contract disputes, including appeals and protests of those agencies, departments, boards, commissions, and instrumentalities Sec. 1703. Fiscal impact statement. This title will not have an impact on the District's financial plan and budget, because it merely authorizes fee-for-service arrangements between District agencies, departments, boards, commissions, and instrumentalities and the Contract Appeals Board. Those units of the government will enter into these intra-district agreements, on a voluntary basis, if they have sufficient resources to pay for the services. The legislation does not mandate any activities or any costs for District government entities. TITLE XVIII. GOVERNMENT MANAGERS ACCOUNTABILITY ACT AMENDMENTS Sec. 1801. Short title.

The performance report shall also state the name and position of the management employee or employees most directly responsible for the achievement of each performance measure, and the immediate supervisor or superior of the management employee or employees Sec. 1803. Fiscal impact statement. This title will not have an impact on the District's financial plan and budget, because it only makes procedural changes and clarifications to the Government Managers' Accountability Act GMAA of 1995. First, the title eliminates the requirement to identify non-management employees responsible for the achievement of each measure to focus responsibility on the senior management of each agency. Second, the title changes the deadline for the submission of performance reports required by the GMAA to January 15th of each year, which gives agencies ample time (three-and-a-half months) to prepare their performance reports after the end of the prior fiscal year. Finally, the title eliminates the two required levels of performance acceptable" and "superior for each measure; henceforth, only one target will be set for each outcome. TITLE XIX.

Short title. This title may be cited as the "Industrial Revenue Bond Fees Act of 2000 Sec. 2002. Subchapter II-C of Chapter 3 of Title 47 of the District of Columbia Code is amended to read as follows Subchapter II-C. Industrial Revenue Bond Fees § 47-340.20. Program fee The Mayor may assess fees in connection with the provision to any for-profit or not for profit entity of loans, grants, credit support, revenue bonds, notes or other obligations authorized pursuant to federal law or regulations or any act or resolution of the Council of the District of Columbia. Such fees shall be in amounts reasonably calculated to defray costs associated with developing, implementing, administering, monitoring, evaluating or otherwise supporting such financial assistance for economic development purposes § 47-340.21. Deposit of proceeds Program fees and the earnings thereon authorized under § 47-340.20 shall be deposited in an industrial revenue bond program fee account, which shall be a sub-account of the special account established under § 47-131(c)(4 § 47-340.22.

Fiscal impact statement. This title has no adverse fiscal impact upon the FY 2001 Budget and Financial Plan, because the industrial revenue bond fees referenced in the title are not included within the budget and financial plan. Only the allocation of these funds is being changed, from the Office of the ENROLLED ORIGINAL 49 Chief Financial Officer to the Office of the Deputy Mayor for Economic Development. TITLE XXI. SHARE DATA CENTER REORGANIZATION Sec. 2101. Short title. This title may be cited as the "SHARE Data Center Reorganization Act of 2000 Sec. 2102. Chapter 3 of Title 47 of the District of Columbia Code is amended as follows a) The table of contents is amended by adding the section designation "§ 47-317.7. SHARE Data Center b) A new section 47-317.7 is added to read as follows § 47-317.7.

Applicability. This title shall apply as of October 1, 2000. Sec. 2105. Fiscal impact statement. This title will not have an impact on the District’s financial plan and budget, because the funds for the data center consolidation have already been provided to the Office of the Chief Technology Officer. The proposed FY 2001 Budget and Financial Plan includes a transfer of $6,285,000 operating funds and $1,100,000 capital funds from the Office of the Chief Information Officer within the Office of the Chief Financial Officer to the Office of the Chief Technology ENROLLED ORIGINAL 50 Officer. The effect of this transfer was to shift responsibility of the SHARE data center, as well as the funding and positions associated with it, to the Office of the Chief Technology Officer. Following the data center consolidation, operating costs associated with the SHARE data center should be equal to or less than they are currently. In addition, the Office of the Chief Technology Officer received $7,500,000 in capital funds in a reprogramming from the Department of Human Services in fiscal year 2000, and another $10,375,000 in capital funds are budgeted in fiscal year 2001 for this project. Therefore, a total of $17,875,000 has already been identified to cover the capital costs of data center consolidation, and there should be no further fiscal impact to the District of Columbia as a result of these amendments.

These spaces will be filled by public school students that would have, if there were no public charter school, attended a non-public school and whose tuition would have been funded from the Tuition and Subsidies. Using the DCPS average of $45,000 for Level 4 day students and $56,000 for a Level 5 residential student, costs for these students would have been $9.32 million for the school year with additional costs for extended year and related services, as well as transportation.

FISCAL IMPACT STATEMENT Sec. 3709. By securitizing the tobacco settlement proceeds, this legislation provides for the savings of $64.01 million in debt service in FY 2001. Thus, it provides the District of Columbia with the flexibility to transfer such savings to the Tobacco Settlement Trust Fund. Both the debt service reduction and the corresponding transfer to the Trust Fund are included in the FY 2001 Budget Request Act.

The requirement for a competitive bid for the selection of the Corporation's underwriter and bond counsel will have a positive fiscal impact as it will require that the Corporation's underwriter and bond counsel are chosen on the basis of lowest evaluated price. TITLE XXXVIII. ADOPTION VOUCHER PROGRAM AND FUND ENROLLED ORIGINAL 81 Sec. 3801. Short title. This title may be cited as the "Adoption Voucher Fund Act of 2000 Sec. 3802. Legislative findings a) The long term needs of District of Columbia children who are in foster care are not being served. Although the Adoption and Safe Families Amendment Act of 2000 shortens the time in which children may remain in foster care, many of these children require additional assistance in order to be adopted b) The financial costs associated with maintaining the 3,000 foster children are high. In addition to the monthly payments to foster parents, the Child and Family Services Agency must supervise and staff each case, the Superior Court of the District of Columbia must pay attorneys and judges to review each case, and the Office of Corporation Counsel must staff and review each case c) Even more critical are the tragic human costs associated with allowing children to languish in foster care. The most recent study on the fate of foster children who "age out" of the child welfare system without finding a permanent home found that 12 to 18 months after they left foster care, just half were employed, one-third were receiving public assistance, one-fifth of the girls had given birth, and more than one-quarter of the boys had been incarcerated d) Many of the children in foster care have foster parents desirous of adopting them but are unable to do so because of the costs associated with adoption e) Providing these foster parents with a one-time financial assistance package in the form of vouchers would facilitate adoptions. Financial assistance would consist of vouchers to cover the costs of the necessary homestudies, compilation of information on the foster children's backgrounds and special needs, and attorneys' fees f) The Congress has appropriated, in the District of Columbia Appropriations Act, 2000 a $5 million payment, to remain available until September 30, 2001, to the District of Columbia to create incentives to promote the adoption of children in the District's foster care system.

Sec. 3805. Establishment of the Adoption Voucher Fund a) There is established the Adoption Voucher Fund Fund The Fund shall be comprised of $2 million of the $5 million appropriated in the District of Columbia Appropriations Act, 2000, approved November 29, 1999 (Pub. L.

MAXIMIZATION OF MEDICAID REIMBURSEMENT Sec. 3901. This title may be cited as the "Maximization of Medicaid Reimbursement Act of 2000 Sec. 3902. The Medical Assistance Administration MAA shall work closely with all District agencies and the Budget Director of the Council of the District of Columbia, in establishing Medicaid rates and Medicaid waiver programs to maximize Federal dollars as a means of reimbursement for services provided by District of Columbia agencies.

Sec. 4003. Fiscal impact statement. There shall be no fiscal impact because these responsibilities reside with the Administrator of School Health. Devising a strategy to identify and process Medicaid applications for uninsured students is the first step in reducing the number of District school students without insurance to pay for their health costs. TITLE XLI. FIRE AND EMERGENCY MEDICAL SERVICES DEPARTMENT INVESTIGATION Sec. 4101. Short title. This title may be cited as the "District of Columbia Fire and Emergency Medical Services Department Tyra Hunter Investigation and Report Act of 2000 Sec. 4102. By January 1, 2001, the Chief of the District of Columbia Fire and Emergency Medical Services Department shall complete an internal investigation and submit to the Council a report on its findings concerning the Department's employees and actions with regard to the death of Tyra Hunter in 1995.

ENROLLED ORIGINAL 85 Sec. 4103. Fiscal impact statement. There shall be no fiscal impact associated with this title. Internal investigations and reports are routinely performed in cases of such incidents. The outcomes of such investigations may result in savings associated with the prevention of such incidents in the future. TITLE XLII. DEPARTMENT OF HUMAN SERVICES WELFARE-TO-WORK TRANSITION PLAN Sec. 4201. Short title. This title may be cited as the “Department of Human Services Welfare-to-Work Transition Plan Act of 2000 Sec. 4202. Definitions 1 Director" means the Director of the District of Columbia Department of Human Services 2 TANF" means Temporary Assistance to Needy Families. Sec. 4203 a) By March 1, 2001, the Director shall develop and submit to the Council a Welfare-to-Work Transition Plan Plan detailing the Department of Human Services strategies to transition TANF recipients whose benefits are set to expire between March 1, 2002, and March 1, 2003, into employment b) The Plan shall 1) Identify and quantify all recipients whose benefits will expire between March 1, 2002, and March 1, 2003 2) Identify specific steps to be taken by the Department of Human Services to prepare these TANF recipients for employment; and (3) Articulate interagency efforts to improve access to employment generally for TANF recipients. Sec. 4204. Fiscal impact statement. There shall be no fiscal impact because the Director is already required to collect this data for TANF. TITLE XLIII. RISK MANAGEMENT Sec. 4301. Short title. This title may be cited as the "Risk Management for Settlements and Judgements Amendment Act of 2000 Sec. 4302. An Act Authorizing the Commissioners of the District of Columbia to settle ENROLLED ORIGINAL 86 claims and suits against the District of Columbia is amended by adding a new subsection (c) to read as follows c)(1) In any case, claim, or suit, either at law or in equity, which the Mayor of the District of Columbia is empowered to settle, the payment for such settlement shall come from the current fiscal year operating budget of the agency or office named in the suit; provided that A) The settlement is less than $10,000; and B) The case was originally filed not more than 2 years before the settlement 2) The Mayor may waive this requirement on a case-by-case basis for good cause shown Sec. 4303. Fiscal impact statement. This amendment will have a positive, although unquantified, fiscal impact on the District. The current practice of paying all settlements and judgements out of a central fund provides little if any incentive for agencies to engage in risk management. This amendment does not increase the number of settlements and judgements, but will encourage agencies to improve risk management. To increase agency budgets to pay this cost would be to remove any incentive on the agency to attempt to control cost. In any case in which the Mayor waives application of this title, the cost will be borne by the Settlement and Judgements fund, as currently practiced. TITLE XLIV. MULTIYEAR BUDGET PLANS FOR SPECIFIC PROGRAMS Sec. 4401. Short title. This title may be cited as the "Multiyear Budget Plan Act of 2000 Sec. 4402.

This description of strategy shall include all of the functions, activities, operations, and projects required for effective implementation of the performance plan. There shall be one or more measures of performance, that address both quantity and quality, for each goal. The performance plan shall state measurable or objective performance goals and objectives for all significant activities of the agency or program.

Sec. 4408. This title is consistent with the FY 2001 budget and financial plan. TITLE XLV. REPROGRAMMINGS OF APPROPRIATED FUNDS FOR FISCAL YEAR 2001 AND BEYOND Sec. 4501. Short title. This title may be cited as the "Reprogramming Policy Amendment Act of 2000 Sec. 4502. Chapter 3 of Title 47 of the District of Columbia Code is amended as follows a) The table of contents is amended by adding the phrase "§ 47-365. Reprogrammings ENROLLED ORIGINAL 88 of appropriated funds for Fiscal Year 2001 and beyond after the phrase "§ 47-364. [Repealed] b) Subchapter IV is amended by adding a new section § 47-365 to read as follows § 47-365.

Fiscal impact statement. This titles has no negative fiscal impact and is consistent with the FY 2001 budget and financial plan. TITLE XLVI. ACCEPTANCE AND USE OF GIFTS Sec. 4601. Short title. This title may be cited as the "Acceptance and use of gifts by District Entities Act of 2000 Sec. 4602 a) An entity of the District of Columbia government may accept and use a gift or donation during fiscal year 2001, or any subsequent fiscal year, if 1) The Mayor approves the acceptance and use of the gift or donation; provided, that the Council of the District of Columbia may accept and use gifts without prior approval by the Mayor; and (2) The entity uses the gift or donation to carry out its authorized functions or ENROLLED ORIGINAL 89 duties b) Each entity of the District of Columbia government shall keep accurate and detailed records of the acceptance and use of any gift or donation under subsection (a) of this section, and shall make such records available for audit and public inspection c) For the purposes of this section, the term "entity of the District of Columbia government includes an independent agency of the District of Columbia d) This section shall not apply to the District of Columbia Board of Education, which may, pursuant to the laws and regulations of the District of Columbia, accept and use gifts to the public schools without prior approval by the Mayor.

REQUIREMENT FOR CFO CERTIFICATIONS OF FUNDS FREED UP FROM RESERVE ROLLOVER AND PRIORITY FOR SPENDING SUCH FUNDS Sec. 4701. Short title. This title may be cited as the "Reserve Rollover CFO Certifications and Priority Spending Act of 2000 Sec. 4702. Of the freed-up appropriated funds in FY 2001 from the reserve rollover as set forth in the FY 2001 Budget Request Act 1) The first $32,000,000 shall be used to provide, in the following order 6,300,000 to the La Shawn Receivership 13,000,000 to the Commission on Mental Health 12,079,000 to the District of Columbia Public Schools, and $621,000 to the Office of the Mayor, if the Chief Financial Officer certifies that the first $32,000,000 is not required to replace funds expended in Fiscal Year 2000 from the Reserve established by section 202(i) of the District of Columbia Financial Responsibility and Management Assistance Act of 1995, Pub. Law 104-8 2) The next $37,000,000 shall be used to provide $37,000,000 to Management Savings to the extent, if any, the Chief Financial Officer determines the Management Savings is not achieving the required savings, and the balance, if any, shall be provided in the following order 10,000,000 to the Children Investment Trust 1,511,000 to the Department of Parks and Recreation 1,293,000 to the Department of Fire and Emergency Medical Services 120,000 to the Commission on Arts and the Humanities 400,000 to the District of Columbia Library 574,000 the Office on Aging 3,296,000 to the Department of Housing and Community Development 200,000 to the Department of Employment Services 2,500,000 to the University of the District of Columbia 1,500,000 to Public Works 1,000,000 to Department of Motor Vehicles 4,245,000 to the Department of Health 1,500,000 to the Commission on Latino Affairs 1,550,000 to the Taxicab Commission 2,500,000 to the Office of Property Management, and $5,000,000 for the savings associated with the implementation of the Cafeteria Plan, if the Chief Financial Officer certifies that the $37,000,000 is not required to ENROLLED ORIGINAL 90 replace funds expended in Fiscal Year 2000 from the Reserve established by section 202(i) of the District of Columbia Financial Responsibility and Management Assistance Act of 1995, Pub. Law 104-8, in Fiscal Year 2000, and that all the savings are being achieved from the Management Savings 3) The next $10,000,000 shall be used to provide 10,000,000 to Operational Improvement to the extent, if any, the Chief Financial Officer determines the Operational Improvement is not achieving the required savings, and the balance, if any, shall be provided in the following order 100,000 to the Civilian Complaint Review Board 200,000 to the Metropolitan Police Department for the Emergency Response Team 1.042.000 to be used for Training 4,890,000 to the Settlement and Judgments Funds, and $3,140,000 to the District of Columbia Financial Responsibility and Management Assistance Authority, if the Chief Financial Officer certifies that the 10,000,000 is not required to replace funds expended in Fiscal Year 2000 from the Reserve established by section 202(i) of the District of Columbia Financial Responsibility and Management Assistance Act of 1995, Pub. Law 104-8, in Fiscal Year 2000 and that all the savings are being achieved from the Operational Improvement Savings; and (4) The balance shall be used for Pay-As-You-Go Capital Funds in lieu of capital financing if the Chief Financial Officer certifies that the balance is not required to replace funds expended in Fiscal Year 2000 from the Reserve established by section 202(i) of the District of Columbia Financial Responsibility and Management Assistance Act of 1995, Pub. Law 104-8. Sec. 4703. Fiscal impact statement. This title is consistent with the FY 2001 budget and financial plan. The FY 2001 Budget Request Act codifies the interpretation that the $150 million in appropriated reserve funds are non-lapsing funds that remain available until expended, and that any amount of the reserve funds expended in one fiscal year shall be replenished in the reserve funds from the following fiscal year appropriations to maintain the $150,000,000 balance. Any amount of the reserve funds that is not expended in one fiscal year is available for reserve fund expenditures in subsequent fiscal years. It is anticipated that most of the $150,000,000 in reserve funds appropriated for FY 2000 will not be expended in FY 2000 and will be available to replenish the reserve funds in FY 2001. Because the FY 2001 Budget Request Act appropriated a new $150,000,000 for the reserve funds in FY 2001, it is anticipated that the rollover of reserve funds from FY 2000 will free up FY 2001 appropriated dollars in the amount that rolls over. The FY 2001 Budget specifies the uses for these freed up appropriated dollars, and this title conforms with that specification. This title requires four stages of certifications by the Chief Financial Officer before the freed up appropriated dollars may be spent, and the title provides the prioritized order in which the funds shall be spent for the specified purposes. TITLE XLVIII. MEDICAL EXPANSION PROGRAM Sec. 4801. Short title. This title may be cited as the "Medical Expansion Program Amendment Act of 2000 ENROLLED ORIGINAL 91 Sec. 4802. Sections 2202(b)(4) and 2206 of the Medical Assistance Expansion Program Act of 1999 is amended as follows a) Section 2202(b)(4) is amended by striking the word "undocumented" and inserting the word "immigrant" in its place b) Section 2206) is amended by striking the word "undocumented" and inserting the word "immigrant" in its place. Sec. 4803. Fiscal impact statement. This program was established in the Service Improvement and Fiscal Year 2000 Budget Support Act of 1999. The reprogramming of the monies to fund the program became available on March 28, 2000. The use of the word "undocumented" instead of the word "immigrant" has made the program difficult to put into place. Consequently, because the money for this program was allocated last year in the Service Improvement and Fiscal Year 2000 Budget Support Act of 1999 and the reprogramming is now in place to implement the program, the enactment of this title has no fiscal impact. TITLE XLIX. FISCAL IMPACT STATEMENT PREPARED BY THE CFO Sec. 4901. The fiscal impact statement prepared by the Chief Financial Officer, dated June 6, 2000, is attached. TITLE XLX. EFFECTIVE DATE Sec. 5001.
