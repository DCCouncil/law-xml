      <summary>Law 23-80 clarifies the soil testing requirements for the urban farm tax abatement and allows the District to enter into a lease agreement with a qualified applicant to create and maintain an urban farm on vacant land. It also allows the Department of Energy and the Environment to waive soil testing requirements for a lessee who does not plant in or use the site soil, but instead uses, for example, raised beds, greenhouses, or hydroponic towers and ensures that the produce does not come into contact with the site soil. </summary>
