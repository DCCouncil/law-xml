      <summary>Law 23-72 provides that an owner of housing of 4 to 10 units who reduces the number of units pay a fee to the Mayor and that fee be deposited into the Housing Production Trust Fund. It provides that by a specified date all fees above $692,000 annually collected pursuant to the Conversion of Rental Housing to Condominium or Cooperative Status Act of 1980 also be deposited in the Housing Production Trust Fund. It also provides for damages and legal action for tenants whose unit has been repossessed for personal use and occupancy and the landlord has subsequently received rent. </summary>
