Sec. 9. Rules. The Mayor may promulgate rules to carry out the purposes of this act. Sec. 10. Fiscal impact statement. The Council expects that the net fiscal impact of this legislation will be neutral or positive. The cost charged by the Federal Bureau of Investigation for each criminal record check is $18.00, and it is estimated that the total number of adults for whom a criminal record check will be required each year is 5,000, for an total annual cost of $90,000. However, it is expected that this cost will be more than counterbalanced by a reduction of the costs to the District that would otherwise be incurred as a result of failed placements caused by caretakers or adults residing in the home who have criminal records indicating that they pose a threat of harm to the children who were placed. The costs that will be reduced include the costs of social workers, therapeutic services, attorney’s fees, and judicial proceedings, where, as has occurred in several cases, it becomes necessary to remove children from foster homes, third- party placements, or adoptive homes because of risks posed to children. Moreover, it is expected that a part of the costs of criminal record checks can be paid by funds available to the District and to foster and adoptive parents under the Adoption and Safe Families Act of 1997, approved November 19, 1997 (P.L. 105-89; 111 Stat. 2115 as increased numbers of adoptions are expedited.
