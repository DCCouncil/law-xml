Fifth Floor 538·2223 or Government Code 137·3806 ro From Date Subject A. Counci 1 Members Committee on Public Services and Consumer Affairs John A. Wilson, Chainnan Ju1y a, 1975 COMMITIEE REPORT Bi11 1-101: to eliminate discrimination, agains~ persons who are or who have been r~cent1y pregnant, in the administration of unemployment insurance benefits. 46 D.C. Code 3lO(h) e%empts pregnant women from receiving unemployment compensation for six 7eeks before the birth of their child and six weeks after. This section was added to the D.C. Code in 1954 (68 Stat. 994) in an effort :o ease the adainistration of unemploy~ent bene!its. Prior to 1954. pregnant wo~en were not a special class and therefore had to meet the same eligibilit7 standards as all other claimants (46 D.C. Code 309 However, Congress felt that i~ was difficult to deter~ine ~hen a preg~a~t ~o~an was actuall7 able and available (46 D.C. Code 309 and that as several other states had such exemptions, the amendment would make D.C. lav more consistent with the law in other states. The District Uuemplo7~ent Compensation Soard currently bas tvo regulacious which deal specifically wit~ pregnancy. 300.4(b) defines the procedure under 46 D.C. Code 3lO(h When the Board learus that an applicant is preguaut, they estiaate her due date from medical evidence, usually a doctors certificate. The woman is exempted from receiving benefits for si~ weeks before the expected dace of birth, and far six weeks after the actual birthdate. Regulation 300.4(a) provides that when pregnancy was an issue in the claimant's separation from employ~ent, she is presumed incapable of wor~ing ~ntil she proves ta the contrary with ~edical evidence, again usually a doctors ~ertifica:e erafore, if a woQan voluntarily left her job because she ~as pregnant, she has the burden of proving she is 9hysically abla co 7ork oef ore she can qualify for benefits though the Board says the same ?resu~pcion of incapacity e:iscs whenever health was an issue in separation o~ e~ploy~ent, c~e=e is ao ot~er regulacioa on che subject 2 3. LEGAL AND OTE 3. DEVELOP~!EN!S l. Cour ctiou !n Cohen v. Chesterfield Count~ School Board, 94 S.Ct. 791 (1974 the Supreme Court thre~ down a Virginia Statute vhich required a pregnant school teacher to leave her job four ~ouths before fi~r due da:e. T~e Court held that the statute created an irrebuttable ?resumption chat the woman was unable to work for the four months before che birth of her child aud therefore that it violated the ~ue process clause. A ~aryland Court, in Orner v, Board J. Aoeeals, Emolov~enc Securitv Ad:inistration. Da~artment of Em~lov~ent and Social Services, Suoerior Court of 3alti~;re City, Docke'Cl'972, Folio 86, Case ~o. 132572, overt~r~ed Maryland's unemployment lav which exempted pregnant women from benefits for four mouths before the birth of their child, for similar reasons Althoush the D.C. e~emption is only for 12 weeks, it does create an irrabuttable presu~ption of physical i~a~ility co wor The dicta of the Cohen case further, is broad and indicates chat anv sue~ presumption violates due process. 2. Other States In 1971 there vere 38 states with e:emptions simila= to the D.C. Code 3lO(h t present there remain only 21 states with such lavs arylaud's law, 95A ~d. Code ~nn. 6f, specifically states that a pregnant woman is eligible as long as she is able and available for ~or Virginia has no statute on the subject itle 60.l 7a. Code Ann so tnat pregnant and pose-pregnant women ~use ~eat the same seandards as any ocher claimant herefore, D.C. is now in the minority in exe~pting pregnant women and is out of line ~ith the ~eigbboring states. 3. Federal Polic7 ~ot only is there no exe~ption i: the Federal unemploy~ent Compensation Laws, but the Oapart~ent of Labor has t7ice urged the states to repeal their exemp:ious rogram Letters #1097 (1970) and ~1186 (1972 As cha Depart~ent of Labor ?a1s for :ha Ad:iniscratian o cue Unemploy~enc Compensation, there should b~ no dif ic~l in obtaining funds to carry ouc Departments' e:?ress policy n 0 Report on Bill l-101 3 Partly due to Title VII of the Civil lights ~ct, the !RA, and the rise of ~ome~'s Liberation, the job market is ~ore open to women dow than it was in 1954 any private employers offer. maternity leaves, if not with pay, at least with ~ull re-employment rights he D.C. Government's ovu policy is th pregnant women may take sick leave if they need it, and full reem?loy-:ie~t privileges is not, therefore, necessarily true that pregnant ¥omen are unemployable, although there may be greater risks involved in hiring a pregnallt woman C. SC:CTION 3! SECTION A~fAL SlS OF TH! PROPOSED B be Committee made only one amendment which restructured the sectio~s of the bill wi:hout changing the language or effect. Purpose he pur~ose of the bill is to eliminate discrimination agai:st persons wno are or who have recently been pregnant in the administration of unem~loyment benefits. Section 2: Section 2 has 2 Subsections. Subsection (a) provides that pregnancy shall not create any presumption of physicar inability ~o ~ork, even where pregnancy was au issue in the separation from employ~ent. This subsection would repeal the D.O.C. Board's regulation 300.4(a If che Board 7ishes to require proof of physical ability where heal:h was an issue in separa:ion from employm.enc, its regulations m.ay so specify. Eo~ever, it is discriminatory for the regulations to require such proof only from pregnant persons. Subsection (b) states that any person who is or ~ho has recentl7 been pregnant must zeet che sa~e eligibility standards as any ocher claimant under the acc be Dep&amp;amp;rement of Labor recommended si~ple repeal of section 3l0(h) of Title 46 of D.C. Code, so that t~era would be no statutory aference to ?reg~ancy at all owever, t~ey did ad~it Chae because of c~e D.O.C. Soard regulations, it ~ay oe b=tter to clarify che status of ?regnant wo~en under the acc. Report on 3ill l-lOl Section 3: Section 3 of che bill repeals the present 46 u.C. Code 3lO(h D EFFECTS OF T2Z PROPOSED BILL l. Legal Effects 4 As indicated before, t~e bill will abolish the presend discri~inatory exemption provision in the Code t will make D.C. law consistent ~ith the laY of Vi:ginia and ~arylaud, and it will carry out the request of the Depart~ent of Labor. 2. Ad~inistrative Ef :ac:s Under the new amend~ent, a pregnant ?ersou will have to ~eet the standards in the C. Code (46 D.C. Code 309) which apply to aLl applicants. Under section 309(c-d) the applicant must have been employed for a certain length of ti~e, and muse meet the common 'able and available' standards. The courts have construed 'available' strictly genuinely actacbed to tbe labor market and making adequate contacts for vorkn. Wood~ard &amp;amp; Lothroo, Inc. v, District of Coluabia Une~olovment r.omoensation ~d, 392 F.2d 479 D.C. Cir. 1963 he Board under 46 D,C, Code 309(d) and §300.Z(a) of its o~n regulations has broad discretion to set a schedule of reporting for any individual. Therefore a pregnant woman ~ould be no more likely co collect unemployment without looking for work than any other individual. A ?regnant a??licanc ~ould also be subject co the other disqualifying standards of 46 D.C. Code JlO: leaving ~ork without good cause, discharge for ~isconduct, and failure to apply for or accept suitable ~ork without good cause. Under this amend~enc a pregnant applicant ~ould be dealt with as any ?erson suffering from a te~porary physical disability. Therefore, ii a 7oman left her job because her pregnanc7 rendared her unable to do that job she ~ould not automatically be disqualified. A construccio: worker wi:h a broken leg may be unable co 7ork conscructiou, but able to do filing or other non-physical labor aeref ore~ pregnancy ~ay be considered good cause for either leaving Mork or failing co acce?t new work; ho~ever, the applicant cannot refuse all ~ork ~ecause of her 9regnancy a~d still neet the initial able and available stand3 Repor~ on Bill 1-101 5 Becoming ?reguant, of course, cannot be consi~ered ~isconduct, although a pregnant woman may commit misconduct. 3. Fiscal Effects Because the extent of disability from pregnancy varies from person to person, the :ose e~ui:able analysis, case by case ill oecessarily involve more ~ork by the District Unemploy~ent Compensation 3oard he costs of adQinistration of benefits are paid by the Depart~ent of Labor. AS the Labor Depart~ent itself recommends abolition ot the exemption, it should not be adverse to covering the extra costs involved. The benefits paid to any clai:ant are collected from their individual employers, and put inco a Trust Fund which is ad~inistered ~Y the Jistrict cr~employmen: Compensation Board. The D.U.C. Board says :hat as most pregnant ~omen are told about the e~emption, the; do not apply during the exemption period. T~erefore there are no realistic estimates of how many women ~ould be affected or how much money ~ould be paid out. aowever, the 3oard did s~bmit t~o mini~um es~i~ates: a. Benefits from November l, 1975 until the end of :iscal l9i6 10,500 b. Benefits for fiscal 1977 13,000 !his ~oney would come out of the !rus~ Fund e percentage any !ndividual em?loyer pays on ~ages paid abo~e a cer:ai~ su h!s experience rating, is based on :he amount of benefits ?aid by the D.J.C. 3oard to that employer's ex-em?loyees over a cer~aia period of time. The experience ratin~ of some employers will be affected, as some ~omen ~ill be eligible if the bill is passed who were not formerly eligible. aoYever, the Soard did not offer any statistics on how many em?loyers would be a!fected. Z. OTSE1 OPINIO~S !he Commission on t~e Status of ~oraea has expressed its support of the-amendment, as has the Depart4en~ o: Labor he D.U.C. Soard offered no suostaaeive comnenes, only fi~ancial estiza:es.</search-text>
