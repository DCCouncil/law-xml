      <summary>Law 21- 257 establishes within the Department of General Services, the Urban Farming Land Lease Program to enable a qualified applicant to enter into a lease agreement with the Department to create and maintain an urban farm on vacant land. It adds provisions that encourage food buying clubs and produce markets, and limits the total amount of funds that may be used to implement the program and to provide tax benefits. The bill reduces the tax liability for owners of real property used for urban farming and specifies that the Mayor may waive any possessory interest tax for city-owned property used for urban farming. </summary>
