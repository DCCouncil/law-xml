      <summary>Law 21-264 establishes a paid leave system for all District residents and for workers who are employed in the District of Columbia. It allows for up to 8 weeks of paid family and medical leave and exempts federal government employees. A qualifying individual is one who becomes unable to perform their job functions because of a serious health condition, or an individual who is caring for a family member with a serious health condition, or other requirements as defined by the bill. It establishes the Family and Medical Leave Fund which includes funding from covered employers, the District government, eligible individuals, and interest earned on the money from the fund. Claims are filed with the District Government and the District must notify the employer within 3 business days of a claim being filed. By December 30, 2017 and quarterly thereafter, the Mayor shall submit to the Council a document that explains in detail the requirements needed in order to develop all software necessary to administer the paid-leave system pursuant to this act. By July 1, 2020, the Mayor shall commence the payment of paid-leave benefits provided for in this act. </summary>
