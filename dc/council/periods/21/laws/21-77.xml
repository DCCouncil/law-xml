      <summary>Law 21-77 directs the Department of Health (DOH) to obtain a standing order, signed by an appropriate medical professional who is licensed in the District, to permit schools to use undesignated epinephrine auto-injectors in emergency circumstances. It requires the Office of the State Superintendent of Education (OSSE) to establish and administer an undesignated epinephrine auto-injector plan authorizing a public school to possess and administer undesignated epinephrine auto-injectors. Epinephrine injectors may be utilized on public school property, field trips, and on sanctioned excursions away from public property. </summary>
