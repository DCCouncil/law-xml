      <summary>Law 21-219 makes changes to two strategic plans pertaining to education facilities. The law requires that the Multiyear Facilities Master Plan reflect a 10-year strategy and changes the requirements for the formulation of the DCPS Capital Improvement Plan. Prior to this law's applicability, the Multiyear Facilities Master Plan was a 5-year strategic plan. The law also includes a provision that permits the Mayor to levy a fine against the Public Charter School Board for the failure of a public charter LEA to submit required data in a timely manner for the Master Facilities Plan, and a specifies that the annual cumulative value of such fines shall not exceed $10,000. </summary>
