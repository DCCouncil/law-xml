      <summary>Law 21-118 amends the District's construction laws to provide for the installation of fire escapes, smoke detectors and carbon monoxide detectors, and authorizes the Mayor to adopt fire safety standards and impose various fees or tax liens to regain funds disbursed while repairing unsafe structures that are not owned by the District.  The bill also provides for the condemnation and removal of structures or portion of structures, and authorizes the Mayor to take action without notice to the owner of the building if immediate danger is present.  It creates a Board for Condemnation of Insanitary Buildings to issue orders of condemnation. </summary>
