  <heading type="long">To amend An Act To provide for compulsory school attendance, for the taking of a school census in the District of Columbia, and for other purposes to clarify agency responsibilities with regard to school attendance, to deem an absence of a minor student from a public school unexcused where the school does not obtain an explanation for the absence from the student's parent or guardian verifying the reason for an absence within  5 days after a student's return to school, to prohibit the suspension, expulsion, or unenrollment of a minor from a public school due to an unexcused absence or due to a late arrival to school, to clarify attendance reporting requirements for public, independent, private, and parochial schools, to revise the protocol for a law enforcement officer who comes in contact with a minor and has reasonable grounds to believe the minor is truant, to revise the educational institution referral requirement for the Child and Family Services Administration, the Court Social Services Division of the Superior Court of the District of Columbia, and the Office of the Attorney General Juvenile Section to only include unexcused full school day absences with regard to attendance, to provide educational institutions with discretion on referrals if a student's 10th or 15th unexcused absence is accrued within the final 10 school days of the school year, and to require the State Superintendent of Education to provide written notice to each public, independent, private, or parochial school outlining the attendance and reporting requirements by July 1 of each year; to amend the District of Columbia School Reform Act of 1995 to conform it to the prohibitions against expulsion and suspension provided in An Act To provide for compulsory school attendance, for the taking of a school census in the District of Columbia, and for other purposes and the Pre-k Enhancement and Expansion Amendment Act of 2008; and to amend Chapter 21 of Subtitle A of Title 5 of the District of Columbia Municipal Regulations to repeal the requirement that a public school notify the Metropolitan Police Department after each occurrence of a student's 10th unexcused absence, to require that an educational institution obtain an explanation for a student's absence within 5 days of the student's return to school, and to amend the terms "truancy rate" and "chronic absenteeism."</heading>

      <summary>District law requires that school-aged children attend school regularly and educational institutions monitor the attendance of enrolled students. Law 21-140 specifies that local education agencies may not remove public school students from enrollment for unexcused absences or late arrivals to school unless the minor has accumulated 20 or more full school day consecutive unexcused absences, and that a full school day is the entirety of instructional hours regularly provided on a regular school day. It requires guardians to provide valid excuses in writing within five days of a minor's absence; prohibits the expulsion, suspension, or de-enrollment of a student because of an unexcused absence or late arrival; requires educational institutions and the Superintendent of Education to collect, publish, and make public data concerning absenteeism, withdrawals from school, and referrals to District agencies and offices, including Child and Family Services, Court Social Services and the Office of the Attorney General Juvenile Section; requires law enforcement officers to return children suspected of truancy to school instead of truancy centers; requires schools to receive truant minors that are returned to school by law enforcement officials; permits educational institutions to exercise discretion when unexcused absences are within the last ten days of the school year; and requires the State Superintendent to send written notice of the provisions of this law to each local educational agency and school.</summary>
