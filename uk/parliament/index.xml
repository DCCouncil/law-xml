  <heading>Laws of the United Kingdom Codified in the D.C. Code</heading>
  <heading type="search">U.K. Laws</heading>
  <text>The American legal system through the late 19th century would regularly incorporate laws of England into the laws of the United States. These are acts of various parliaments of countries that were eventually incorporated into what we now know as the United Kingdom.</text>
  <text>The provided PDFs of these laws were extracted from archival images of "The statutes at large, from Magna Charta to the end of the last parliament 1761", Owen Ruffhead, Printed by M. Baskett 1768-1800. Georgetown Law Library graciously scanned and provided the original archival images.</text>
  <text>The Session is named after the years of the reign of the monarch in which the session occurred. Thus "11 Geo. 2" is the session that started in the 11th year of the reign of King George II.</text>
