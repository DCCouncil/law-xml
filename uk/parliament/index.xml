  <heading>Laws of the United Kingdom Codified in the D.C. Code</heading>
  <text>The American legal system through the late 19th century would regularly incorporate laws of England into the laws of the United States. These are acts of various parliaments of countries that were eventually incorporated into what we now know as the United Kingdom.</text>
  <text>The Session is named after the years of the reign of the monarch in which the session occurred. Thus "11 Geo. 2" is the session that started in the 11th year of the reign of King George II.</text>
