POLICE AND FIRE SENIOR MANAGEMENT OVERTIME Sec. 3701. Short title. This title may be cited as the "Police and Fire Senior Management Overtime Amendment Act of 2001 ENROLLED ORIGINAL 63Codification District of Columbia Official Code, 2001 Edition West Group Publisher, 1-800-228-2180. Sec. 3702. Section 1103 of the District of Columbia Government Comprehensive Merit Personnel Act of 1978, effective March 3, 1979 (D.C. Law 2-139; D.C. Official Code § 1- 611.03 is amended by adding a new subsection (f) to read as follows f)(1) Uniformed members of the Metropolitan Police Department at the rank of Inspector and above shall not receive overtime compensation for work performed in excess of a 40-hour administrative workweek, excluding rollcall 2) Uniformed members of the Fire and Emergency Medical Services Department at the rank of Assistant Fire Chief and above shall not receive overtime compensation for work performed in excess of 40 hours in an administrative workweek and in excess of 48 hours in a workweek for those uniformed members of the Fire and Emergency Medical Services Department at the rank of Assistant Fire Chief and above in the Firefighting Division 3) Uniformed members of the Metropolitan Police Department at the rank of Inspector and above and uniformed members of the Fire and Emergency Medical Services Department at the rank of Assistant Fire Chief and above shall not be suspended for disciplinary actions for less than a full pay period Sec. 3703. This title shall apply to pre-1980 employees of the Metropolitan Police Department and the Fire and Emergency Medical Services Department upon its enactment by Congress. Sec. 3704. Fiscal impact statement. In the Fiscal Year 2002 budget submission for the Metropolitan Police Department the Mayor proposed "ending the practice of paid overtime for senior staff" and assumed savings totaling $250,000. Subsequently, administration witnesses testified this was to apply to captains and above. Because captains, like lieutenants, have neither the advantage of recent pay increases afforded members of the collective bargaining unit (sergeants and below) nor the manager-level salaries afforded inspectors and above, this title restricts overtime for inspectors and above, and does not impose any restrictions on captains and lieutenants. Although the Mayor's budget did not specifically address overtime restrictions for senior managers within the Fire and Emergency Medical Services Department, the District's personnel policies generally have been consistent with regard to the 2 major public safety agencies and, therefore, this title also proposes that the restriction apply equally to the 2 departments. TITLE XXXVIII. ADVISORY COMMISSION ON SENTENCING Sec. 3801. Short title. This title may be cited as the "Advisory Commission on Sentencing Amendment Act of 2001 ENROLLED ORIGINAL 64Codification District of Columbia Official Code, 2001 Edition West Group Publisher, 1-800-228-2180.

Official Code § 3-101(a is amended to read as follows a) The Advisory Commission on Sentencing Commission is established as an independent agency within the District of Columbia government, consistent with the meaning of the term “independent agency” as provided in section 301(13) of the District of Columbia Government Comprehensive Merit Personnel Act of 1978, effective March 3, 1979 (D.C. Law 2-139; D.C. Official Code § 1-603.01(13 b) Section 8 (D.C. Official Code § 3-107) is amended as follows 1) Subsection (b) is amended to read as follows b) The Commission has the authority to hire staff and to obtain appropriate office space, equipment, materials, and services necessary to carry out its responsibilities. The Commission shall serve as the personnel authority for all employees of the Commission. Except as provided in subsection (d) of this section, the provisions of the District of Columbia Government Comprehensive Merit Personnel Act of 1978, effective March 3, 1979 (D.C. Law 2-139; D.C. Official Code § 1-601.01 et seq “CMPA” shall apply to the Commission 2) A new subsection (d) is added to read as follows d) Employees of the Commission who were hired before the effective date of the Fiscal Year 2002 Budget Support Act of 2001, passed on 2nd reading on June 5, 2001 (Enrolled version of Bill 14-144 shall be exempt from the requirement that they be residents of the District of Columbia. Any person hired after the effective date of the Fiscal Year 2002 Budget Support Act of 2001 shall be, or shall become with 180 days of hire, a resident of the District of Columbia. The Director of Personnel may waive the residency requirement for any individual appointed to a hard-to-fill position under this section Sec. 3803. The District of Columbia Government Comprehensive Merit Personnel Act of 1978, effective March 3, 1979 (D.C. Law 2-139; D.C. Official Code § 1-601.01 et seq is amended as follows a) Section 406(b D.C. Official Code § 1-604.06(b is amended as follows 1) Paragraph (18) is amended by striking the word "and" at the end 2) Paragraph (19) is amended by striking the period at the end and inserting the phrase and" in its place 3) A new paragraph (20) is added to read as follows 20) For employees of the Advisory Commission on Sentencing, the personnel authority is the Advisory Commission on Sentencing b) Section 903(a D.C. Official Code § 1-609.03(a is amended by adding a new paragraph (6C) to read as follows 6C) The Advisory Commission on Sentencing Commission may appoint 6 ENROLLED ORIGINAL 65Codification District of Columbia Official Code, 2001 Edition West Group Publisher, 1-800-228-2180. persons who shall report directly to the Executive Director, or to the Chairman of the Commission Sec. 3804. Fiscal impact statement. This title has no fiscal impact because it is only a clarifying amendment. The Advisory Commission on Sentencing Establishment Act of 1998, effective October 16, 1998 (D.C. Law 12-167; D.C. Official Code § 3-101 et seq does not clearly designate the Commission as either an independent or subordinate agency. Section 2(a) of that act merely states that "[t]here is established the Advisory Commission on Sentencing Due to the ambiguity of the act, the Commission did not follow the rules of the CMPA when hiring staff. Therefore, this title designates the Commission as an independent agency, subject to the CMPA, and places the Commission's staff in the Excepted Service. Because the Commission was not aware of the residency requirement for Excepted Service when hiring, this title exempts the current staff from the residency requirement. The Committee on the Judiciary believes this is the equitable decision since the staff was not aware of the residency requirement when accepting the job offer. TITLE XXXIX. REQUIREMENT FOR CFO CERTIFICATION OF FUNDS FREED UP FROM THE RESERVE ROLLOVER AND PRIORITY FOR SPENDING SUCH FUNDS Sec. 3901. Short title.

Official Code § 51-101 et seq “Unemployment Compensation Act”) with the federal requirement to permit the withholding of federal income taxes from unemployment compensation benefits at the request of the claimant. In addition, it permits the withholding of District income taxes from unemployment compensation benefits. The proposed changes will not have a negative effect on the operating or capital budgets of the District for the current and preceding 5 fiscal years. This amendment has the potential of actually increasing local revenues because it allows the District to withhold taxes from unemployment compensation benefits checks as they are being disbursed to the recipients, thereby raising revenues at a faster, guaranteed rate. The Department does not anticipate that the District will incur any expenditures as result of these proposed changes. No current revenue or other funds are required to implement the proposed changes to the Unemployment Compensation Act. There is no fiscal impact on the current appropriations to finance the implementation of the proposed changes. There will be no additional sources of revenue recommended in the forthcoming fiscal years to implement these proposed changes. TITLE XLVIII. MAINTENANCE OF EFFORT AND MATCHING FUNDS Sec. 4801.
