    <search-text>ENROLLED ORIGINAL 1Codification District of Columbia Official Code, 2001 Edition West Group Publisher, 1-800-228-2180. AN ACT IN THE COUNCIL OF THE DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA To require labor peace agreements for hotel development projects in which the District of Columbia has a proprietary interest. BE IT ENACTED BY THE COUNCIL OF THE DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA, That this act may be cited as the “Hotel Development Projects Labor Peace Agreement Act of 2002”. Sec. 2. Findings and declarations a) In the course of managing real property that it owns or in otherwise carrying out its functions in the public interest, the District may participate in real property developments as a property owner, lessor, proprietor, lender, or guarantor, facing similar risks and liabilities as other business entities participating in such ventures. As a result, the District has an ongoing proprietary interest in these developments and a direct interest in their financial performance b) The District must make prudent management decisions, similar to any private business entity, to ensure efficient management of its business concerns and to maximize benefits and minimize risks. One risk is the possibility of labor-management conflict c) A major potential outcome of labor-management conflict is economic action by labor unions against employers. Experience of municipal and other investors demonstrates, for example, that organizing drives pursuant to the formal and adversarial union certification process often deteriorate into protracted and acrimonious labor-management conflict. Labor- management conflict can result in construction delays, work stoppages, picketing, strikes, consumer boycotts, and other forms of adverse economic pressure. Such conflict may adversely affect the District’s financial or other proprietary business interests by causing delay in the completion of a project, reducing the revenues or increasing the costs of the project, and by generating negative publicity d) These risks are heightened in the hotel industry because this industry is so closely related to tourism, which is a linchpin of the District economy. Labor-management conflict in hotel projects in which the District is an economic participant can jeopardize the operation of related tourist and commercial facilities, as well as the District’s national reputation as a tourist and convention destination e) One method of reducing the risk to the District’s proprietary interests is to require, as a condition of the District’s investment or other economic participation in a development project, that employers taking part in the development project seek agreements with labor organizations in which the labor organizations agree to forbear from adverse economic action against the employers’ operations.

Sec. 3. Determination of need for labor peace agreement a) For each hotel development project in which the District participates or has a financial interest, the Mayor shall determine whether the District of Columbia has a proprietary interest in the development project.

Sec. 4. Contents of labor peace agreement a) The labor peace agreement shall be a written agreement between the employer and the labor organization that contains, at a minimum, a provision prohibiting the labor organization and its members from engaging in any picketing, work stoppage, boycott, or other economic interference with the employer’s operations in which the District has a proprietary interest, for ENROLLED ORIGINAL 3Codification District of Columbia Official Code, 2001 Edition West Group Publisher, 1-800-228-2180. the duration of the interest b) The labor peace agreement shall be enforceable under section 301(a) of the Labor Management Relations Act of 1947, approved July 23, 1947 (61 Stat. 156; 29 U.S.C.§ 185(a or through any other relief provided by law, including administrative and judicial relief, after the best efforts of the parties at resolving a dispute have failed c) The employer and labor organization may incorporate additional provisions in the labor peace agreement to protect the District’s proprietary interest d) An employer that performs its obligations under a labor peace agreement will be relieved of further obligation to abide by the procedures in the agreement, if the labor organization engages in adverse economic action such as striking, picketing, or boycotting the employer.

Sec. 6. Limitations a) Nothing in this act requires an employer to recognize a particular labor organization b) Nothing in this act requires an employer to enter into a collective bargaining agreement establishing the substantive terms and conditions of employment c) This act is not intended to, and shall not be interpreted to, enact or express any generally applicable policy regarding labor-management relations or to regulate those relations in any way d) This act is not intended to favor any particular outcome in the determination of employee preference regarding union representation e) Nothing in this act permits or requires the District or any employer to enter into any agreement in violation of the National Labor Relations Act of 1935, approved July 5, 1935 (49 Stat. 449; 29 U.S.C.S.§ 151 et seq Sec. 7.
