      <summary>BILL SUMMARY - As introduced, this bill requires the Department of General Services (DGS), the Department of Parks and Recreation (DPR) and the District of Columbia Public Schools (DCPS) to create a master list of public recreational spaces in the District and publish it on the DGS website. The Mayor must transmit the results of a study to the Council concerning the safety of all synthetic materials currently used in construction projects at District public recreational spaces. DGS must provide the Council with a remediation plan for spaces that do not meet health and safety standards and also provide notice to these DCPS and DPR. </summary>
