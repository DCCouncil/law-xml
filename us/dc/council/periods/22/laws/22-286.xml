      <summary>BILL SUMMARY - As introduced, this bill requires the Commissioner of the Department of Insurance, Securities and Banking to value certain contracts on an annual basis based on the standard required in the valuation manual. It requires the valuation manual to specify definitions and minimum valuation standards for policies and contracts. It expands the Commissioner's authority to require companies to adjust their reserves and  establish reserves as specified in the valuation manual.  It allows the Commissioner to share and receive confidential information for enforcement purposes. Among other things it also requires companies to certify via actuary that the company's reserves and related actuarial items are computed properly.</summary>
