      <summary>This legislation clarifies which accident and traffic data the Mayor will report to the Council and when an all-terrain vehicle or dirt bike may occupy public space in the District. The legislation also specifies that the presence of workers is unnecessary for a moving violation to double. It establishes criminal penalties for violating the Ignition Interlock System Program.  It also clarifies established penalties for 3 time offenders of certain driving offenses within a five year period.  </summary>
