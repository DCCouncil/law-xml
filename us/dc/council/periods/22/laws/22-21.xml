      <summary>BILL SUMMARY - As introduced, this bill requires child development facilities to undertake various processes to minimize or eliminate lead exposure through water sources. The bill requires each facility to test water sources for lead concentration, install and maintain filters, shut off access to water sources found to contain excess lead, and include lead testing results in its annual health and safety report. The District will reimburse facilities for compliance costs associated with this law at a reimbursement rate determined by the Mayor.</summary>
