      <summary>BILL SUMMARY - Non-traditional child care is a service offered to parents whose work schedule is outside of the standard hours of 7 am to 6 pm, Monday through Friday. As introduced, this bill requires OSSE to conduct a study to evaluate the sufficiency of the number of non-traditional child care facilities. The evaluation must include the total number of current non-traditional facilities operating in the District, the current level of service being provided, the current need for non-traditional facilities, and recommendations.</summary>
