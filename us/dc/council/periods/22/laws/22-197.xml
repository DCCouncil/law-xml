It requires the Mayor to provide developmentally appropriate facilities, services, care, subsistence, education, treatment, training, segregation, and protection for youth offenders convicted of misdemeanor offenses and those pending trial or convicted of felony offenses. It also requires the Mayor to develop and submit to the Council a strategic plan for providing the facilities and services for youth offenders. </summary>
