      <summary>Law 22-314 establishes a process for individuals disqualified from firearms registration due to mental health to petition the Superior Court of the District of Columbia for relief from that disqualification. It makes it unlawful to knowingly possess or receive a firearm that has a removed, obliterated, or altered serial number or to possess, conceal, store, barter, sell, or dispose of a stolen firearm or ammunition and establishes increased penalties for violations; exempts persons and organizations who briefly possess stolen firearms, ammunition, or firearms with altered serial numbers from criminal liability if the possession was undertaken in order to surrender the firearm or ammunition to the MPD; and establishes a penalty for persons previously convicted of a felony who re-offend by possessing ammunition and a penalty for possession a large capacity ammunition feeding device.  It also establishes a process for the personal service, renewal, and termination of extreme risk protection orders. It prohibits the possession of bump stocks. </summary>
