      <summary>BILL SUMMARY - As introduced, this bill expands the definition of "at-risk" students to include pre-k aged children who are experiencing homelessness, are in the District's foster care system, or qualify for TANF or SNAP. It also provides for additional allocations of local funds for education programs for children of pre-k age based on the number of students served that are identified as at-risk. The bill also requires OSSE to establish a competitive pilot program, the Child Development Centers and Homes Facility Allowance Pilot Program, to provide a facility allowance to high-quality child development centers and child-development homes that meet certain requirements.  </summary>
