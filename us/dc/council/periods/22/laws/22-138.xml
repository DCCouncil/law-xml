      <summary>BILL SUMMARY - As introduced, this bill prohibits restrictive land covenants or prohibitive contracts which prohibit the subsequent use of real property as a grocery store, on a site that is presently used as a grocery store. It provides an exception to an owner of a grocery store that relocates the grocery store within one-half mile of the previous site. For the exception to apply, relocation to the new site must occur within 2 years of the sale, transfer, or lease of the prior site and the restrictive covenant imposed on the prior site cannot exceed 3 years.</summary>
