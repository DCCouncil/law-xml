      <summary>BILL SUMMARY - As introduced, this bill authorizes the use of electronically powered devices for transportation and related services (personal delivery devices) within the District. Use is authorized on sidewalks and crosswalks except within the central business district. The bill also specifies that operators are legally responsible of the operations of a PDD and prohibits certain persons and entities from operating a PDD. The devices must obey all traffic control devices and signs, operate in a safe and non-hazardous manner, yield to pedestrians, and may not unreasonably interfere with pedestrians or traffic. </summary>
