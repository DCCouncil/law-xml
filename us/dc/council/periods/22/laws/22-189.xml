      <summary>BILL SUMMARY - As introduced, this bill updates the District's notary laws to conform with current best practices. It does not require the notary's sole place of residence or business be in the District. It gives the Mayor the authority to revoke the commission of notary publics who take higher fees than what is permitted by law. Among other things it requires that upon death, resignation, or revocation, notaries must return the official notarial seal to the District, along with other official documents and establishes an electronic notary system.  </summary>
