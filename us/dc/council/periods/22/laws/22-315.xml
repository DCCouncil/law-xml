      <summary>Law 22-315 authorizes the Mayor to review employee residency annually and terminate the employment of employees who fail to maintain the required residency; requires the Mayor to publish an annual list of positions for which employees failed to maintain residency; permits the personnel authority to retain employees who violate the residency agreement in instances of extraordinary hardship; exempts most Career Services employees from the requirement to be a District resident; provides for the awarding of a residency preference for some individuals who have separated from a foster care program, even if not currently residing in the District; and provides for non-competitive hiring in cases of a severe shortage of candidates or critical hiring needs.</summary>
