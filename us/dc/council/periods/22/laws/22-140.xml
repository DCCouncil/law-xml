      <summary>BILL SUMMARY - As introduced, this bill updates key portions of the District's Consumer Protection Procedures Act (CPPA) to make it consistent with similar statutes in other states and Federal Trade Commission (FTC) law.  Among other things, it establishes what is an "unfair" business practice and raises the amount of civil penalties that the District can assess per violation. </summary>
