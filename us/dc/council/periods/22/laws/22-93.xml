  <heading type="long">To amend the Department on Disability Services Establishment Act of 2006 to require the Department on Disability Services to establish a process for the resolution of formal complaints, including formal complaints filed with a provider, establish a peer support pilot program to assist people with intellectual disabilities throughout the formal complaint process, and publish an annual report regarding the peer support pilot program, to require that a formal complaint filed with the Department on Disability Services receive a prompt review by the Director or the Director's designee, to require the Department on Disability Services to refer formal complaints to an external reviewer in accordance with rules issued by the Department on Disability Services, to authorize any person aggrieved by an action of the Department on Disability Services relating to a formal complaint to appeal the action of the Department on Disability Services to the Office of Administrative Hearings, to provide that if a person files a formal complaint with the Department on Disability Services that is substantially similar to a case that the person previously initiated in the Superior Court of the District of Columbia or the Office of Administrative Hearings, the Department on Disability Services shall deny the formal complaint, and to require the Mayor to issue rules, which shall be subject to Council review, to implement provisions relating to formal complaints; to amend the Office of Administrative Hearings Establishment Act of 2001 to expand the jurisdiction of the Office of Administrative Hearings to include appeals of formal complaints filed with the Department on Disability Services; to amend the Citizens with Intellectual Disabilities Constitutional Rights and Dignity Act of 1978 to repeal provisions relating to admissions, to prohibit new commitments other than commitments of persons found incompetent in a criminal case, to provide that decisions of the Superior Court of the District of Columbia ordering commitment of a person with an intellectual disability, other than a decision of the court ordering commitment of a person found incompetent in a criminal case, that was issued before the effective date of this act shall be reviewed in a court hearing annually, and to provide that a commitment entered into before the effective date of this act, other than a commitment of a person found incompetent in a criminal case, shall be terminated unless the person committed, or a person close to the committed person, provides informed consent to continue the commitment; to amend Title 21 of the District of Columbia Official Code to authorize the Department on Disability Services to petition the Superior Court of the District of Columbia to remove a limited guardian or a general guardian, and to make conforming amendments; to amend the Nursing Home and Community Residence Facility Residents' Protections Act of 1985 to repeal an unnecessary provision; to allow a supported person and a supporter to enter into a supported decision-making agreement that authorizes a supporter to provide supported decision-making, be present during the supported decision-making process, when requested by the supported person, or, in the presence of the supported person, assist the supported person in obtaining information that is relevant to a given life decision and communicating the supported person's decisions to others, to require a person or a District agency who receives a supported-decision making agreement to give certain notices to the supporter and to rely on the supported decision-making agreement, to provide that neither a person nor a District agency shall be subject to criminal or civil liability, nor shall a person be considered to have engaged in professional misconduct, for an act or omission done in good faith and in reasonable reliance on a supported decision-making agreement, to require a District employee or a caregiver, who is aware of the existence of a supported decision-making agreement and has a reasonable belief that the supported person is an adult in need of protected services, to report the alleged abuse, neglect, or exploitation, and to require the Mayor to issue rules to implement provisions relating to supported decision-making agreements.</heading>

      <summary>BILL SUMMARY - As introduced, this bill removes the requirement that persons with intellectual disabilities who are supported by the Department of Disability Services (DDS) be civilly committed in order to receive residential services. It repeals and amends existing law to bar new civil commitments of persons with intellectual disabilities. Persons who are already civilly committed will also have their commitments terminated unless that person or his or decision maker provides informed consent to the commitment at annual hearings. The bill also requires DDS to work with DC Superior Court to end civil commitments and creates a legal framework to facilitate the supported decision making that will replace civil commitments. Persons found incompetent to stand trial in a criminal case will continue to be civilly committed. </summary>
