      <summary>BILL SUMMARY - As introduced, this bill protects victims of domestic violence, sexual abuse, or stalking as well as their family members against discrimination by employers and labor organizations from acts based wholly or partially upon a disruption or threat to the individual's job or workplace by a person threatening to commit domestic violence, sexual abuse, or stalking.  It also makes it unlawful to deny an individual's request for a reasonable accommodation for the individual's safety and security.  It will also make unlawful an adverse action that is based wholly or partially on the individual's leave request for attendance, participation or preparation for a court proceeding relating to domestic violence, sexual abuse, or stalking.</summary>
