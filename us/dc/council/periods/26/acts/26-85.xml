  <heading type="long">To amend, on an emergency basis, due to congressional review, section 8f of the Homeless Services Reform Act of 2005 to require specific documentation from tenants establishing eligibility for Emergency Rental Assistance Funds, to clarify the definition of a qualifying emergency situation, and to require the Mayor to issue regulations implementing the amended provisions of that section; and to amend section 501 of the Rental Housing Act of 1985 to permit a court to enter a stay, rather than require a court to enter a stay, when a tenant submits documentation to the court demonstrating that the tenant has a pending Emergency Rental Assistance Program application, to require housing providers to reschedule evictions in certain circumstances involving approved Emergency Rental Assistance Program applications, and to create an affirmative defense in eviction cases on the basis of housing providers' noncompliance with the Emergency Rental Assistance Program application process.</heading>
