      <summary>BILL SUMMARY - As introduced Bill 26-29 would assist survivors of sexual misconduct by requiring institutions of higher education in the District to retain a confidential resource advisor (CRA) to provide emergency and ongoing support to reporting parties at institutions of higher education. It would require amnesty protections for reporting parties of sexual misconduct in certain cases. Institutions would be required to facilitate mandatory annual sexual misconduct trainings for all students and personnel. It would establish minimum criteria for institutions’ sexual misconduct policies. It would also, among other things, require institutions to submit to the Higher Education Licensure Commission a report containing data about sexual misconduct on campus. </summary>
