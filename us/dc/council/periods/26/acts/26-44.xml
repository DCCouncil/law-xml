It would remove the 3-year maximum on certificate of need applications for active projects and also require the State Health Planning and Development Agency to update the capital expenditure and medical equipment spending thresholds every two years.  It also, among other things, would increase the number of beds that must be added or removed at a health care facility in order to trigger a certificate of need. </summary>
