ESTABLISHMENT OF TOBACCO SETTLEMENT TRUST FUND Sec. 2301. Short title. This title may be cited as the "Tobacco Settlement Trust Fund Establishment Act of 1999 Sec. 2302. Establishment of Tobacco Settlement Trust Fund a) There is established within the General Fund of the District of Columbia, a trust fund designated as the Tobacco Settlement Trust Fund Fund” to which shall be credited, without regard to fiscal year limitation, all revenue owed and accruing to the District from the proceeds of the tobacco litigation settlement, except for the first $16.05 million recognized as general fund revenue and already included in the base budget in FY 2000, and except for the second $16.05 million which is allocated first to the reserve to replace funds allocated from the reserve to the fund pursuant to Title XX of this act.

Sec. 2303. Fiscal impact statement. The FY 2000 budget assumes that the District will receive only 30% of the projected revenues from the Tobacco Settlement or approximately $420 million over a 30-year period. This assumption has been made because the executive branch of the federal government asserted a claim against the tobacco settlement payments in proportion to the federal Medicaid match. The current Federal-District match rate is 70-30. To date, legislation has been approved by the U.S. Senate and is pending before the U.S. House of Representatives which would prohibit the federal government from recouping any share of the tobacco settlement funds. Should that legislation prevail, the District will receive approximately $1 billion in additional revenue over 30 years from the Tobacco Settlement, for a total of $1.4 billion. Sec. 2304.
