The payments shall be made directly to the ceding insurer or to its domiciliary liquidator, except where 1) The contracts or other written agreements specifically provide for another payee of the reinsurance in the event of the insolvency of the ceding insurer; or 2) The assuming insurer, with the consent of the direct insureds, has assumed the policy obligations of the ceding insurer as the direct obligation of the assuming insurer to the payees under such policies and in substitution for the obligations of the ceding insurer to the payees Sec. 3. Section 2 of the Law on Credit for Reinsurance Act of 1993 is amended by adding a new subsection (b-1) to read as follows b-1)(1) No credit shall be allowed under this section, as an admitted asset or deduction from liability, to a domestic ceding insurer for reinsurance, unless the reinsurance agreements include a proper insolvency clause as set forth in paragraph (2) of this subsection 2) A proper insolvency clause, in substance, provides that in the event of the insolvency of the ceding insurer, the reinsurance shall be payable under contracts reinsured by the assuming insurer on the basis of reported claims allowed by the Superior Court of the District of Columbia, without diminution because of the insolvency of the ceding insurer.

The expense may be filed as a claim against the insolvent ceding insurer to the extent of a proportionate share of the benefit which may accrue to the ceding insurer solely as a result of the defense undertaken by the assuming insurer. If 2 or more assuming insurers are involved in the same claim and a majority in interest elect to interpose a defense to the claim, the expense shall be apportioned in accordance with the terms of the reinsurance agreements as though the expense had been incurred by the ceding insurer Sec. 4.
