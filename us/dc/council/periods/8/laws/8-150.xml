For purposes of thi;~3 subsection, the age of ’the oldest child shall be used for the computatJ.on of the entire child support order amount rather th~n to compute a separate amount for each child h)(1) An offset from the child support order amount shall be allowed for the child’s portion of a medical insurance premium if the noncustodial parent adds or has already added the child to the noncustodial paren%’s current medical insurance policy and the conditions described in this subsection are met. The offset shall be determined by the subtraction from the noncu.~todial parent’s gross income of the amount of the premium attributable to coverage for the child measured on a per capita basis 2) The noncustodial parent shall present proof of the increase in a medical insurance premium incurred as a result of the addition of the child to the medical insurance policy. The proof provided shall identify clearly that the source of the incre se of the medical insurance premium is 4 the child who is the subject of the child support order. The cost shall be reasonable 3) If a noncustodJal parent does not have medical insurance coverage, does not have a 2nd family, and can obtain medical insurance coverage at a reasonable cost, the court may order the noncustodial parent to obtain medical insurance coverage for the child in accordance with federal law. The amount of the offset shall equal the difference between the premium for single coverage and the premium for fami].y coverage. No offset shall be calculated by using the cost for the coverage for the noncustodial parent 4) If the noncustodial parent has family medical insurance coverage in the noncustodial parent’s medical plan for a 2nd family, the addition of the child who is the subject of the child support order need not result in an additional cost. of medical insurance coverage to the parent. The noncustodial parent shall be required to provide proof that the child has been added, to the medical insurance coverage and to provide a medical insurance~card to the custodial[ parent. An offset shall not be given if there is no additional cost of medical insurance coverage to the noncustodial parent i) The ]payment of an ur~insured extraordinary medical or dental expense i~]cu].~red by a minor child, who is the subject of a child suppo].~t petition shall be treated on a case by case basis, absent an agreement between the parties. If the court determines that the medical or dental expense is necessary and is in the best interest of the child, the court may reduce the child support order of the noncustodial parent for a portion of the payment that the noncustodial parent makes toward the medicsi], or dental expense or may increase the child suppo]:’t order to reimburse the custodial parent for payments made by the custodial parent j) The percentage of the noncustodial parent’s gross income shall be reduced by a percentage that corresponds to the custodial parent’s share of total parental gross income.

For each additJ.onal child, the threshold ~{mount to be used to apply the offset, shall increase by $2.,000o 5 k)(1) If the parties present a consent order, an agreement that is to become an. order, or a written agreement that is to be merged in an order, the judicial officer shall examine the child support provisions of the agreement, and compare the child support provisions to the guideline. If the amount of child support agreed upon is outside of the range of child support that would be ordered presumptively upon application of the guideline, the judicial officer shall determine if the agreed upon level of child support is fair and just. If the parties are represented by counsel, the judicial officer shall inquire whether the attorney informed the clients of the guideline. If the clients have not been informed of the guideline, the judicial officer shall advise the attorneys to do so. If a party is not represented by an attorney, the judicial officer shall ensure that the party is aware of the child support amount that the court would order presumptively pursuant to the guideline 2) The propriety of any deviation from the guideline shall be justified in writing with a statement of the factors that form the basi~l for the judicial officer’s finding that the deviation is fair and just. A transcript filed in the jacket shall suffice as a writing i) Application of the guideline shall be presumptive. The guideline shall be applied unless application of the guideline would be unjust or inappropriate in the circumstar~ces of the particular case. Departures shall be set forth and explained, in writing. The factors that may be considered to overcome the presumption are I) The, needs of the child are exceptional and require more than average expenditures 2) The gross income of the noncustodial parent is substantially less than that of the custodial parent 3) A property settlement provides resources readily available for the support of the child in an amount at least equivalent, to the formula amount 4 The noncustodial parent supports a dependent other than the child for whom the custodial parent receives credit in the formula calculation, and application of the guideline would result in extr~ordinary hardship 5) The noncustodial parent needs a temporary period of reduced child support payment to permit the repayment of a debt or l’earrangement of his: or her financial obligations. A temporary reduction may be included in a child support order if A) The debt or obligation is for a necessary expenditure of reasonable cost in light of the noncustodial parent’s fam~ly responsibilities B) The time of the reduction does not exceed 12 months; and "’(C) The child support order includes the amount that is to be paid at the end of "the reduction period and the date that the higher payments are to commence 6) The custodial parent provides medical insurance coverage for the child at an additional cost to the custodial parent’s medical insurance coverage and the additional cost is significant in relation to the amount of child support prescribed by the: guidelines 7) ChJ. ldren of mo~’e than I noncustodial parent live in the custodial parents household, receive a child support payment from the noncu~todial parent, and the resulting gross income for the custodial parent and the children in the household causes the standard of living of the children to be greater than that of the noncustodial parent; or 8) Any other exceptional circumstance that would yield a patently unfair result m) The formula established in subsection (q) of this section incorporates a va~riation of plus or minus 3~ for each level. A variation within the plus or minus 3~ l~.mit need not be justified by written findings but specific findings are advisable. The factfinder shall consider at least the following factors in the application of a variation I) A child has regular and substantial income that can be used for child support without impairment of the child’s current or future educa, tion 2) The n~oncustodial parent ha~ special needs that require addit.~onal subsistence cost 3) The noncustodial parent pays for certain expensive necessities for the child, such as tuition or orthodonti a 4) The child has ~moderately more than average needs 5) High child care costs are involved 6) There is no medical insurance coverage, medical insurance coverage does not cover dental or major medical items, or the medical ~nsurance coverage has a high deductible, and the expenses are paid or are to be paid by the custodial parent n) In a case in which shared custody is ordered or agreed to and the c]3ild spends 40~ or more of the child’s time with each pare]3t, the guideline shall not apply presumptively. For the purposes of this subsection shared custody" means actual visition that exceeds 40 of the year. The guideline shall be considered advisory, and if, in the discretion of the judicial officer, application of the guideline would result in an urtjust or inappropriate order in a particular circumstance, the following procedure shall be considered 1)(A) Calculate the amount that the father would pay the mothe[~’ if the mother ihas sole custody, and multiply the amount by i[.5 B) Calculate the amount that the mother would pay the father if the father has sole custody, and multiply the amount by i~5 2)(A) Multiply the father’s obligation by the percentage of the time the mother has the child B) Multiply the mother’s obligation by the percentage of the time the father has the child 3) The difference between the amounts of paragraphs (2)(A) and (2)(B) shall be the net transfer Apply any necessary credit or debit. For example, if 1 parent pays all the day-care expense, he or she is entitled to a credit for the day-care expense attributable to the days the child is with the other parent o) A child suppo~’t order issued under this section or section 5 of the District of Columbia Child Support Enforcement Amendment Act of 1985, effective February 2 ’[987 (D.C.

The Department of Human Services Office of Paternity and Child Support Enforcement, and the Child Support Section of tile Civil Division of the Office of the Corporation Counsel shall establish a procedure for informing the noncustodial and custodial p~rent if a modification is warranted under the guideline 3) There shall be 8 presumption that there has been a substant:~al or material change of circumstances that warrants a modification of a child support order application of the guidel ne to the current circumstances of the parties results in an amou,~t of child support that 8 varies from the amount o’g[ the existing child support order by 15~ or more. A child suppo~’t order shall not be modified based solely on the enactment of the guideline. The presumption may be rebutted by A) Proof of special circumstances such as a circumstance that would take a case outside the guideline~ or B) Proof of substantial reliance on the original child support o~der i~sued prior to adoption of the guideline, and that app~lication of the guideline, would yield a patently unjust result The cent].~al figure stated in the guideline shall be used to compute the amount of child support that the guideline would yie[Id for modification and to apply the test for the presumption 5) If a child support order is issued after September 27, 1987, and the child support order is outside the guideline, by order of the court or by merged agreement of the parties, the presumption shall not apply within 1 year of the issuance of the child support order 6) If a petition to modify a child support order pursuant to this section is accompanied by an ~ffidavit that sets forth sufficient facts and guideline calculations, and is accompanied by proof of service upon the respondent, the Family Division may enter an order to modify the child support order in accordance with the guideline unless a party reque~ts a hearing within 20 days of service of the petition for modification No order shall be modified without a hearing if a hearing is timely requested 7) Notwithstanding paragraphs through (6) of this subsect.~on, a pal~ty ma_v submit a praecipe with a certification of ws~:[ver and supporting documentation, as prescribed by the court to modify the child support amount by agreement of the parties at any time. This agreement shall be treated and reviewed by the court for issuance of a revised decree in the same manner as an original agreement of the parties :is reviewed 8) The jud:icial officer shall state the reasons for a departure from the guideline in writing. A transcript filed in the jacket shall suffice as a writing 9) Notwithstanding paragraph 3(B) of this subsection, if a new ch;[Id is born to the custodial and noncustodial parent, the guideline shall be applied to the entire family and I order shall be issued for all the children in the fam~].y f po~sible, the 2 cases shall be consolidated if the child support of the last child is petitioned as a separate case. 9 I0) Nothing in this subsection shall preclude a party from moving to modify a child support order at any other time p)(1) If a custodial parent has custody of children of more than 1 noncustodial parent, the judicial officer shall determine the standard of living of the custodial and noncustodial households. Standard of living is measured by dividing the gross income available to the household from all sources by the poverty level income (Chart 5) for the number of adults contributing ncome to the household, plus the number of children. If the standard of living for the custodial household is larger than the standard of living of the noncustodial household, the departure principle pursuant to subsection (1)(7) of this section may apply 2) If the noncustodial parent has other children living with him or her, the guideline shall be determined as follows A) The guideline amount shall be determined for all. of the children who live with the noncustodial parent and with the custodial parent for whom the noncustodial parent is responsible, except any child who is already the subject of a child support order B) A per cap~.ta share of the guideline amount for a child who lives in the noncustodial parent’s household shall be subtracted from the noncustodial parent’s gross income. The remaining income shall be used as the noncustodial parent’s gross income to calculate child support for a child befo~e the court 3) If the judicial officer determines that the presumption has been ow~rcome, the amount of child support ordered shall not reduce the standard,of living of the child to less than that of the noncustodial parent.
