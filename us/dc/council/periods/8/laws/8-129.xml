WARD 1 HOUSING a) Housing policy in the ward addresses both the need for housing and the need for it to be located where residents have access to the other basic necessities of urban living b) Ward 1 has about 39,300 housing units, according to the 1985 census estimate; 14 percent of the total number of 282, 300 units city-wide. In 1980, housing units numbered 38,000, of which close to 33,500 were occupied (households some 88 percent of the ward’s units as compared to a city-wide occupancy of 91 percent. The ward had close to 1,800 vacant units which were not for rent or sale. The ward had close to 1,800 vacant units which were not for rent or sale. The "for rent or sale" vacancy rate was 7.6 percent, well above that of most wards c) Renters occupied 25,300 housing units, about 75 percent of the total occupied units, while the 8,100 owner-occupied units amounted to about 25 percent of the total. This contrasts with the city which has 65 percent renter-occupied and 35 percent owner-occupied units. For the total ward population, 30 percent or 22,400 people lived in owner-occupied units, while 51,700 people or 70 percent lived in renter-occupied units. This contrasts with the city totals of 42 percent or 252,500 people in owner-occupied units and 353,900 people or 58 percent in rental units d) As of 1981, there were approximately 20,100 occupied subsidized housing units, which constituted approximately 8~ of the total occupied stock in the District. The figures are now estimated to reach close to 21,000 e) Affordable housing remains a serious problem for large numbers of low and moderate-income households Affordable" housing is traditionally defined as housing that costs 25~ of new household income. Because of the rising cost of housing affordable" may have to be redefined as housing that costs 30~ or more of new household income. Of the households with incomes under $I0,000 in 1981, approximately 18,300 households spent between 35 and 59~ of their income for shelter and 15,400 households spent 60~ or more of their income for shelter SEC. 1200.106.

WARD 1 ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION a) While most environmental issues are dealt with at the regional level, there are specific environmental issues that must be addressed at the ward level b) Noise pollution affects human health and can work to the disadvantage of area business. Loud speakers installed in retail establishments often interfere with human interaction. The District of Columbia Noise Control Act of 1977, effective March 16, 1978 (D.C. Law 2-53; D.C. Code, sec. 1-315, note should be enforced to achieve its 53 objectives and amended to protect apartment buildings in commercial zones c) Some Ward 1 properties, including Reed-Cooke, have erosion problems. Substantive improvements have been achieved by the District government in the water quality, although extensive regional development may change this situation. Sedimentation, erosion, and sewer overflows are still major causes of ward water quality degradation. Most of the ward has good solid conditions. The Beltsville-Chillum and Sassafras-Chillum soil association cover most of the geography of the ward. Both of the soil associations are well drained and permit urban uses without creating erosion problems. Special attention must be given to the area along Rock Creek Park and the National Zoological Park d) Solid waste collection management needs improvement. Litter on public spaces creates a negative image and unsanitary conditions. The problem is evident in the commercial corridors, especially Columbia Road, 18th Street, Mount Pleasant Street, and 14th Street. Street cleaning must be done more often, not only t~ reduce unsightliness, but also to help eliminate rodents e) Strict adherence to air quality emission controls is necessary to meet established air quality~standards. Special attention should also be given to st!tionary sources, including heating plants on old buildings, to ascertain compliance with air quality emission controls. Traffic congestion should be reduced to limit the concentration of carbon monoxide SEC. 1200.110. WARD 1 OBJECTIVES FOR ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION The objectives for environmental protection are as follows I) To promote the overall environmental quality of land in the ward by enforcing the prohibition against illegal storage and handling, controlling rodents and eliminating rubbish pile ups on vacant property; and 2) To encourage the cultivation of produce gardens on public and private land in selected areas, such as the urban gardens at 14th and Belmont Streets, N.W that is operated by the University of the District of Columbia’s Cooperative Extension Services SEC. 1200.111. WARD 1 POLICIES IN SUPPORT OF ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION OBJECTIVES The policies in support of environmental protection objectives are as follows: 54 I) Promote land use patterns and transportation services that decrease reliance on automobiles for commuting and routine trips to reduce air pollution 2) Ensure reliable, adequate, r.efuse collection from residences, business establishments, and other facilities throughout the ward 3) Encourage the recovery and recycling of solid waste materials through appropriate regulatory, management, and marketing strategies 4) Practice water conservation in each District government facility and operation and promote conservation by businesses and the general public 5) Eliminate leakage in the water distribution system in the ward and maintain the system in good condition 6) Enhance the capability of the Cooperative Extension Service of the University of the District of Columbia to provide technical assistance and research in the form of educational materials and programs for citizens gardening efforts in the ward 7) Enhance the capability of private nonprofit community gardening organizations to provide technical assistance in the organization and development of community gardens of residents of the ward; and 8) Encourage the Board of Education to make appropriate portions of buildings and grounds available in the ward for community gardens and use buildings and grounds for instructional programs in science and gardening classes that prepare students for agriculture related businesses, including landscaping and restaurant produce supply, to lessen unemployment and the grocery bills of area residents SEC. 1200.112. ACTIONS TO IMPLEMENT ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION OBJECTIVES The actions to implement the environmental protection objectives are as follows I) To improve the quality of the waterways, which is affected by the District’s combined storm and sanitary sewer system that services most areas in Ward I, by A) Reducing the impact of the combined sewer overflows on the rivers and streams and investigating ways to increase the operating efficiency for the Wastewater Treatment Facility; and B) Accelerating the implementation of the District’s combined sewer overflood abatement program 2) To address litter in commercial and residential neighborhoods and solid waste in general, which are problems that detract from the environmental quality of the ward and increase clean up costs to the District by: 55 A) Enforcing the health, sanitation, and building codes, including surveying vacant units, lots, and public spaces to ensure compliance with the litter and solid waste control programs B) Exploring opportunities t° create neighborhood-based recycling centers C) Coordinating efforts with appropriate District government and community groups to become certified as a "Keep America Beautiful City D) Examining existing legislation to identify impediments to implementing the District’s litter laws E) Strengthening and enforcing laws designed to ensure that property owners maintain their properties free of litter and debris and that garbage and trash are properly handled F) Expanding the "Clean It or Lean It" program to include grounds of vacant buildings; and G) Strengthening the anti-littering laws and enforcing the laws against all violators 3) To ensure that commercial establishments, especially restaurants, bar-type operations, and recently renovated apartment buildings provide enough space inside buildings or on the premises to handle deliveries, trash, and garbage by A) Ensuring, through the permit and design review processes, that new buildings and renovations of existing buildings have adequate service areas and amending regulations as necessary B) Preventing the expansion of commercial establishments, including restaurants that seek to establish sidewalk cafes or additional serving areas, unless the waste disposal system for current operations is adequate and can be expanded to handle the additional service 4) To eliminate unoccupied and boarded up buildings that are scattered throughout the ward, which contain code violations, are infested by rats, mice, and roaches, and pose significant sanitation problems by A) Strengthening the "War on Rats" and other environmental health programs in the ward B) Enforcing laws that apply to solid waste disposal, storage areas, and trash management for both residential and commercial owners in the ward 5) To decrease the heavy dependence on automobiles and the resultant air pollution problems in the ward and in the District by A) Supporting, building, and improving a fully integrated bus and subway system to serve the Shaw, U Street, and Columbia Heights areas to reduce~air pollution; 56 B) Improving bus service and traffic signal controls to reduce bus and automobile emissions; and C) Discouraging commuter automobile traffic and encouraging mass transit to reduce commuter dependence on streets in the ward 6) To decrease the health hazards and unpleasant areas that are created by human and domesticated animal excretia by A) Enforcing laws designed to control domesticated animal excretia B) Providing additional, e~sily accessible, and well-maintained, public restrooms, in public areas and commercial establishments 7) To address the fact that front and side yards of residentially used buildings are being paved over and that tree boxes and other public strips are not maintained by the District government or theiowners by A) Amending the Public Spa6e Regulations to provide controls on front and side yards between the building restriction line and the street curb to encourage maintenance standards and enhance existing laws regarding yard and public space maintenance B) Consider paving, in the Reed-Cooke neighborhood, all remaining "parking which ~is the space between the sidewalk and curb on Ontario Road and Euclid Street, with the exception of maintaining and restoring all tree boxes in a discrete rather than continuous fashion 8) To address the fact that industrial uses that are contiguous to schools and residential communities pose hazards to human health in some areas of the ward by A) Removing uses that generate noise, truck traffic, odors, particulates, and utility station operations; and B) Considering amending the Zoning Regulations (II DCMR I01 et seq to prevent uses referenced in subparagraph (A) of this section in residential communities and require that the uses be located in areas where the uses can be buffered from residential communities SEC. 1200.113. WARD 1 TRANSPORTATION a) The Ward’s transportation system consists of a modern transit system, with subway and bus s4rvices, a comprehensive highway and street system, and~speclal services for the elderly and handicapped. T~ansportation systems historically play a major role in shiping~ land uses b) Ward 1 is the smallest of the 8 wards, but because it is just north of central Washington and has a large population, it requires and contains extensive transportation services. The Ward 1 transportation routes 57 serve as conduits to the Downtown retail and employment centers c) Major commuter routes in the ward include 16th Street, Rock Creek Parkway, Connecticut Avenue, Rhode Island Avenue, Massachusetts Avenue, and Georgia Avenue d) Traffic circulation west of 16th Street in Ward 1 is affected by Rock Creek. Only Massachusetts and Connecticut Avenues, Park and Klingle Roads, and Calvert Street provide cross-park service. As a result, congestion, particularly at Calvert Street and Connecticut Avenue, is a significant problem during rush hours e) Parking restrictions that improve the flow of rush hour traffic impose a hardship on residents who live on affected streets and have few alternatives for parking. Residents on Monroe, Kenyon, Irving, and Harvard Streets, and Columbia Road are especially inconvenienced. The streets are frequently cleared of illegally parked cars, which increases the competition among residents for legal parking spaces f) Public transportation in important in Ward i. About 58~ of households are without cars and, consequently, dependence on mass transportation in the ward is high. The elderly, which comprise about 13~ of the ward’s population, is usually transit dependent. The population under 15 years, 18~ of the ward’s population, cannot drive and is considered transit dependent. Income distribution also suggests high transit dependence. Twenty-three percent of the households in the ward are low income, earning less than $5000 a year. Another 53~ are moderate income households, earning $5,000 to $15,000 a year g) Ward 1 is served by approximately 50 Metrobus routes. About 37~ of the routes operate at least 20 hours per day and 75~ offer rush hour service at least once every 15 minutes. On thoroughfares such as Connecticut Avenue, where a number of lines operate, buses come as often as once every 5 to 7 minutes h) During off-peak hours, buses usually run once every 30 minutes with some operating once every 15 to 20 minutes. Saturday and Sunday service is also frequent. Over 50~ of regular weekly service extends through the weekend i) The principal defect in transit service in Ward 1 is the limited east-west service. Primary routes for east-west travel across Rock Creek Park are 1/2 to 1 mile apart. Park and Klingle Roads, Calvert Street, Connecticut Avenue, and Massachusetts Avenue are the only routes across Rock Creek Park. On the east side of the ward, the few east-west routes through the extensive Howard University/Old Soldiers Home area are Rock Creek Church Road, Irving Street, Columbia Road, and Harvard Street. 58 j) A 1981 study of small buses in District neighborhoods that was conducted by the ATE Management and Service Company found several transportation service problems in the ward. These problems are as follows I) In Mount Pleasant, some residents complain that transit routes do not penetrate the neighborhood well. Since their community is hilly, the effort required to walk 3 to 4 blocks to bus stops discourages patronage, particularly for the large elderly population. Other residents complain that full-size buses on residential streets create excessive noise, vibration, add street congestion 2) The area between Columbia Road and Rock Creek Church Road west of Georgia Avenue lacMs adequate bus service. Revisions to the crosstown Route H could make service comparable to that in the rest of the ward 3) Connections between residential neighborhoods and major destinations in the eastern part of the ward could be improved. Howard University Hospital and the Washington Hospital Center complex could be made more accessible k) The greatest complaint is that buses are overloaded during the peak hours. So many people use the bus in some neighborhoods that buses are full within a short distance, including between Mount Pleasant and Adams Morgan. Passengers boarding later must ride standing. Buses traveling 16th Street and Connecticut Avenue to Downtown from upper Northwest Washington and outlying areas in Maryland are crowded by the time they reach Ward I I) The ATE study limited its inquiry to the need for bus routes that serve neighborhoods. Actually, one of the greatest deficiencies in the mass transportation network is the limited links for commuting from the District to suburban jobs m) Certain activities in the ward increase the demand for parking, especially around the Connecticut Avenue business area, the "embassy row" employment area, the Hilton Hotel, the Howard University area, and 18th Street and Columbia Road in the Adams-Morgan area n) In the summer months, the Nationa~ Zoo generates visitor parking. Activities at the Shorehamland Sheraton Hotels attract on-street parking in Woodley Park. Finally, many commuters avoid commercial parking feeslby parking on streets near bus or Metrorail stations and t~en taking public transportation. Some Ward 1 streets have Residential Permit Parking RPP which allows residents to park in theirneighborhoods during the the day while limiting commuter parking o) The Metrorail subway system is having the greatest positive impact on land use in the District. Rapid 59 rail service to the ward has been a high priority since the initial proposals for a regional system. Two Metrorail stations on the Red Line, located in 2 adjacent wards, already serve Ward I: the Woodley Park-Zoo Station in Ward 3, and the Dupont Circle Station in Ward 2 p) Stations at Shaw and U Street are under construction and the current schedule calls for trains to run between U Street and Gallery Place by late 1990 and to Anacostia by late 1991. Metro officials estimate that the Shaw and U Street Stations will be used by 18,100 and 15,100 people each day, respectively. Ward I anticipates the construction of Columbia Heights and Georgia Avenue Metro Stations once funding and routing matters are resolved q) The overall transportation goal for the District is to provide a transportation system that meets the needs of its residents, employees, and visitors and ensures the effective functioning of the District SEC. 1200.114. WARD 1 OBJECTIVES FOR TRANSPORTATION The objectives for transportation are as follows I) To support the District policy of preserving and improving Ward ] neighborhoods, facilitate the commerce of the ward, and support the ward and District growth and development objectives to expand business and job opportunities 2) To complete the Green Line Metrorail route in Ward 1 and promote the increased use of mass transit throughout the ward 3) To reduce the ward’s dependence on the private passenger automobile in order to improve air quality and reduce congestion 4) To provide a system of streets and alleys to ensure access to all sections of Ward 1 and the District; and 5) To maintain and provide an efficient, effective transportation system in Ward I, maximize accessibility and the movement of people and goods, and provide safe and convenient pedestrian bicycle circulation within the ward’s neighborhoods SEC. 1200.115. WARD i POLICIES IN SUPPORT OF TRANSPORTATION OBJECTIVES The policies in support of transporation are as follows I) Support land use arrangements that simplify and economize transportation services in Ward I, including mixed use zones that permit the co-development of residential and nonresidential uses, encourage additional residential zoning and development at strategic locations, particularly near the U Street and Shaw Metrorail Stations; 6O 2) Establish traffic management strategies in Ward 1 to separate local traffic from through traffic in residential neighborhood enclaves, if possible, and discourage commuter traffic through the ward street system 3) Support the completion of the entire 103-mile Metrorail system as rapidly as possible, and accord priority to the construction of the Green Line Metrorail Route with stations at Shaw, U Street, Columbia Heights, and New Hampshire/Georgia Avenue 4) Promote the increased use of mass transit in Ward 1 and the District 5) Revise the Metrobus routes within the ward to effectively capitalize on the available Metrorail service and changes in residential and shopping patterns, and relocate bus stops as required to promote service efficiency 6) Improve taxi service throughout the ward to provide links to Metrobus and Metrorail, and explore the use of innovative transit services on key routes, not only in rush-hour periods, but also during non rush-hour periods 7) Establish and enforce standards for lighting, curb cuts, ramps for the handicapped, and other amenities in the ward, promote the development of sidewalks and pedestrian paths to complete the District’s pedestrian system 8) Continue to modernize Ward l’s system for traffic signal controls, install traffic system management techniques throughout the ward, improve automobile inspection procedures, and support the District’s programs for the ward’s neighborhood stabilization and commercial growth and development; and 9) Support continuation of assistance for transit dependent groups in the ward, including the elderly, students, and persons whose situation and isolation require special services SEC. 1200.116. WARD 1 ACTIONS TO IMPLEMENT TRANSPORTATION OBJECTIVES The actions to implement transporation objectives are as follows I) To complete the Green Line with stations at Shaw, U Street, Columbia Heights, and Georgia Avenue, and the Downtown station, to ensure that Ward I residents receive adequate public transportation services by A) Providing full funding for the development of each of the 4 Metrorail stops on the Green Line in Ward I, which include Shaw, U Street, Columbia Heights, and Georgia Avenue/New Hampshire Avenue;

and B) Control special event traffic at the convention hotels and that is associated with intensive zoo use so that traffic flow will not be impeded and residents will be able to use their own streets for parking. 62 5) To eliminate the unsafe conditions for pedestrians created by narrow sidewalks by A) Widening sidewalks at the intersections of 16th and U Street B) Eliminating the right turn lanes on 16th Street and providing sidewalks and planting areas C) Widening the sidewalk at the intersection of 18th Street and Columbia Road D) Preventing intrusions into existing public space on sidewalk areas that do not leave a minimum width of I0 feet of unencumbered paved walking area for pedestrians in commercial and mixed-use areas; and E) Widening the sidewalks on the south side of the 1300 and 1400 blocks of Park Road 6) To conduct small area studies to make crosswalks and signage and timing of control signals safer and simpler for pedestrian traffic, especially at 18th and Florida, along 18th Street from Florida to Calvert, at 14th and Park Road, and at 16th, New Hampshire and U, since the signage and timing control lights and crosswalks do not contribute to safe and confortable pedestrian street crossing 7) To address the fact that parking spaces are inadequate in commercial and residential areas by A) Identifying sites and implementing strategies for potential short-term parking in neighborhood commercial areas pursuant to the Neighborhood Municipal Off-Street Parking Act of 1980 B) Providing public parking facilities for both residents and customers in the 18th and Columbia, 14th and Park, and 14th and U Street commercial areas C) Selecting parking site locations so as to prevent adversely affecting nearby residential communities or parkland D) Conducting a feasibility study on the possibility of adding parking spaces to the top of the 3rd District Police Station E) Expanding the diagonal parking program and consolidating bus stops in order to increase the number of parking spaces at selected commercial areas, such as 18th and Columbia Road; and F) Removing rush hour parking restrictions in Ward 1 where feasible 8) Better enforcement of residential parking permit restrictions, alley parking and loading restrictions is needed A) Expand parking enforcement program by providing additional equipment and staff to carry out enforcement. 6;3 B) Develop regulations and legislation to allow owners to have automobiles or other vehicles obstructing access to their property or parked on their property towed immediately at any time during the twenty-four hour period when the violation occurs 9) A balanced transportation network, including safe pedestrian travel areas, and bicycle paths where possible, should be delineated in order to accommodate the various travel interests of Ward 1 residents A) Study ways to make bicycle travel less hazardous in Ward i, without impeding or restricting pedestrian traffic, and without unduly restricting vehicular traffic flow B) Study ways to make pedestrian travel more desirable and less hazardous in Ward I C) Provide improved public space for use by pedestrians by carefully planned street furniture and planting D) Improve the median strip in the center of Sherman Avenue with trees, shrubs, grass and flowers E) Provide additional stop signs where needed, such as the corner of 19th and Kalorama Road and Champlain and Euclid Streets, where a four-way stop sign is needed to replace a two-way stop sign F) Consider providing a planted median strip along Calvert to Adams Mill similar to the median strip along Cleveland Avenue, or Adams Mill in Lanier Heights, which is raised in surface and alternately planted and paved I0) The arterial and other streets in the ward are severely congested and do not have sufficient capacity to carry rush hour traffic through or around the ward A) Retain certain one-way streets, such as on 15th and 17th Streets, designed especially to accommodate through traffic, but do not expand the number of such one-way systems unless it is designed to improve safety and functioning of the local streets B) Encourage the use of mass transit for commuter trips C) Remove as feasible the rush hour restriction parking areas along streets utilized for through traffic as part of an overall effort to encourage increased use of mass transit SEC. 1200.117. WARD I FACILITIES a) The public facilities throughout Ward I play an important role in serving residents and contributing to the quality of the Ward’s neighborhoods. These facilities include schools, parks, and recreation centers, libraries, police and fire stations, and health and cultural facilities. The following section highlights these facilities in Ward I, some of which are designed to serve both the immediate areas and the city b) The public facilities goals of the District are to provide adequate public facilities in good condition to support the cost-effective delivery of municipal programs and services and to support economic development and neighborhood improvement and residential service objectives c) The major tool for implementing the policies of the Public Facilities Element is the Capital Improvements Program CIP Under the Mayor’s Order 84-87, a Capital Program Coordinating Officer was created in the Office of the Budget in May 1984 to prepare the Capital Budget and the Capital Improvements Plan. The Office of Planning is responsible for reviewing all projects recommended for inclusion in the Capital Improvements Program for consistency with the Comprehensive Plan for the National Capital d) A major survey of public facilities in Ward 1 is essential to determine maintenance problems and capital improvement needs. This is especially important in Ward 1 which has a high population density and a low level of parks, open spaces and recreational facilities SEC. 1200.118. WARD 1 OBJECTIVES FOR PUBLIC FACILITIES The objectives for public facilities are as follows I) To ensure the construction, rehabilitation, and maintenance of facilities essential for public service delivery in Ward I 2) To provide for the coordinated planning of public facility construction and rehabilitation in Ward I 3) To locate public facilities to provide optimum service and to support the land use, transportation, economic and social development, and neighborhood improvement plans throughout Ward I SEC. 1200.119. WARD 1 POLICIES IN SUPPORT OF PUBLIC FACILITIES OBJECTIVE The policies in support of the public facilities objective are as follows I) Develop appropriate criteria, adequate information, and thorough coordination procedures to assist in establishing priorities for-capital improvement projects in Ward I 2) Provide adequate funding for Ward l’s public facility maintenance, and develop alternative capital financing and public facility construction techniques, including joint development, c]~eative leasing arrangements, and financing instruments designed to reduce long-term debt accumulations; 65 3) Develop a ward-wide public facilities plan based on the Comprehensive Plan and the agencies’ facility master plans, and conduct a regular review of facility use and an assessment of trends and factors that will affect the future use of facilities or the demand for the services provided 4) Review all proposals in Ward 1 for new construction, replacement or reuse of public facilities for consistency with the objectives of the District’s Comprehensive Plan elements; and 5) Consider the adequacy of transportation access throughout Ward 1 in locating proposed public facilities, and providing appropriate landscaping, buffering and access for all public facilities so that undesirable community impacts in the ward are minimized SEC. 1200.120. ACTIONS TO IMPLEMENT PUBLIC FACILITIES OBJECTIVES The actions to implement the public facilities objectives are as follows I) Maintenance at public facilities throughout the ward should be improved A) Improve maintenance and safety at the following public areas and facilities i) 16th Street and Harvard Park ii) Parkview Park iii) Bancroft Elementary School Playground; Park; Park; Avenue; Street iv) New Hampshire Avenue and T Street v vi) Harrison Playground; l~th Street and Ogden Street vii) Cooke School Grounds viii) Unity Park ix) 18th Street and Columbia Road x) Warder and Newton Streets xi) Park Road and New Hampshire xii xiii xiv) 13th and U Streets; Kenyon and Warden Streets; Georgia Avenue and Newton xv) Georgia Avenue and Park Road xvi) Georgia Avenue and Otis Place xvii) Kalorama Park xviii) Community Park West; and xix) Small triangular and other street parks, especially small park bounded by 19th and T Streets and and Florida Avenue. 66 B) Redesign and completely renovate Unity Park. Amenities shall include water and a a decorative fountain. Eliminate the bandstand. End use of the Park by festivals to protect the new amenities and foral and evergreen landscaping. Establish rules to close the Park at night and to encourage the Park’s use by local residents, particularly the elderly and parents with children 2) Since many public buildings and recreational areas are inaccessible to people with physical disabilities, plan for new facilities and rehabilitate existing facilities to accommodate, as necessary, physically impaired individuals 3) Library services and collections are inadequate for certain age and population groups in the ward A) Expand resources of the D.C. Public Library through utilizing public school and local college resources as well as those of its own B) Increase, through the District of Columbia Public Library, the number of "bookmobiles" within easy walking distance of each resident C) Consider providing an Adams Morgan library in the abandoned Adams Annex, and, if not feasible, sell the property, which is residentially zoned, to be rehabilitated for housing 4) Ward 1 has the smallest number of recreation and park facilities, and the ones that it does have are understaffed in some instances and inadequately equipped A) Retain existing Federal and D.C.-owned park and recreation centers, illustrating the boundaries of these facilities on the Comprehensive Land Use Map, and creating a zoning category for parks and open space B) Complete Phase II of Community Park West, small field house, providing staff, and illustrating park boundaries on the map C) Provide improvements in Kalorama Park in such as way as to not adversely affect the adjacent residential community D) Provide parks and recreation areas, especially for children, on public land or other vacant lots in Mount Pleasant, including, specifically, consideration of playground equipment of the grounds at Bancroft Elementary School E) Encourage use of parks for non-noisy, relatively small open air events, such as non-amplified chamber music concerts or puppeteers F) Continue current, and develop additional, community garden programs G) Develop small pocket parks and open spaces areas. 67 5) Ward 1 does no~ have adequate full-service in-door recreational facilities for its youth A) Develop a full-service, year round, youth recreational facility for Ward 1 youths at RLA Parcel 27 in the area of 14th and Irving Streets B) Review current recreational facilities and programs and target improvements through regular budget cycle and the Capital Improvements Program SEC. 1200.121. WARD 1 URBAN DESIGN BACKGROUND a) Ward 1 is an old part of the city, with strong architectural character. Structures and design elements date to the last 19th and the early 20th centuries. The predominately low skyline is punctuated with spires, pediments, turrets, mansards and richly carved cornices, all of which recall "period" architectural styles. Other buildings design elements include bay or oriel windows, carved limestone lintels, arched openings, English basements, tiled vestibules and leaded and stained glass transoms. Large residential, commercial and public buildings generally have limestone facades with metal or slate roofs. Smaller apartments and rowhouses consist of masonry with limestone and pressed metal detailing. Brick is the predominant building material for the Ward b) Architectural style and form differ from one major artery to the next. Connecticut Avenue has a full range of architectural styles dating from the early 1900’s to the 1970’s. Sixteenth Street, the former "Street of Embassies" displays the grandest of styles Palaces" and stately chanceries are found in great abundance. Fourteenth Street, historically the commercial strip fo~ the area, is now a Development Opportunity Area characterized by vacant or boarded parcels awaiting development, new mid-rise apartments, the public buildings built since the 1968 civil disturbances, and older rehabilitated apartment buildings. Lower Georgia Avenue’s predominant character is defined by the campus of Howard University to the west, north and south see map c) Eighteenth Street and Columbia are particularly expressive of a strong multi-ethnic, historic and urban character. The festive ambience of both streets created by antique shops, art galleries, boutiques, ethnic restaurants, largely in restored turn-of-the-century buildings, and the cultural kaleidoscope of the area, should be preserved d) U Street, the major east-west artery, and one of the former cultural centers of’ the Black community, today contains both rehabilitated and deteriorating buildings. Major changes are anticipated when the U Street Metrorail Station and three major developments are completed. Residential uses between the arteries are characterized 68 predominantly by masonry three and four story rowhouses and apartment buildings e) Urban design guidelines for Ward 1 should cover major portions of the ward, including I) Rock Creek Park and Piney Branch Parkway;’ 2) Shaw School Urban Renewal Area 3) 14th Street Urban Renewal Area;’ 4) Metro Station Impact Area 5) LeDroit Park Historic District 6) 16th Street Historic District 7) Mount Pleasant Historic District 8) Striver’s Row Historic District 9) Massachusetts Avenue Historic District I0) Howard University Master Plan II) National Zoological Park; and 12) Individual landmark buildings and special streets, including 16th Street, Vermont Avenue, New Hampshire Florida and Georgia Avenues, and others SEC. 1200.122. WARD 1 OBJECTIVES FOR URBAN DESIGN The objectives for urban design are as follows I) To develop overall strategies and design philosophies that reflect Ward l’s unique neighborhood characteristics 2) To restore Ward l’s bridges to their original form, with special emphasis on the Taft and Ellington Bridges 3) To develop programs and schedules to restore and landscape all public parks, squares and Circles in the ward with special emphasis on Meridian Hill Park (Malcolm X Park Kalorama Park, and others 4) To develop design standards that distinguish "special" streets from other streets in Ward 1 to include treatment to roadbeds, pedestrian crosswalks, curbs and gutters, tree areas and street trees, sidewalk paving and street furniture, with special emphasis on lighting and lamp post treatment throughout the ward 5) To evaluate in Ward 1 the areas of conflict on commercial streets at the curb line, including parking, loading zones, fire hydrants, bus stops, street trees, curb cuts, street furniture and facade treatment 6) To evaluate Ward l’s alleys serving commercial land uses for their’ adequacy as loading and maneuvering spaces, especially in commercialicorridors. Evaluate increased loading and access facilities to accommodate delivery and parking functions at the rears of new commercial buildings; and 7) To encourage private landscaping of public yards and spaces in Ward I. 69 "SEC. 1200.123. WARD I POLICIES IN SUPPORT OF URBAN DESIGN OBJECTIVES The policies in support of urban design objectives are as follows I) Strengthen and enhance the physical image and symbolic qualities of Ward 1 that establish its character as an urban center and the Nation’s Capital 2) Design new residential, commercial, and other buildings to complement or enhance Ward l’s physical character 3) Design Ward l’s buildings to include the use of appropriate arrangements of building materials, height, scale, massing, and buffering to complement the immediate areas 4) Encourage development adjacent to areas of strong architectural character to provide a physical transition in building design detail in order to create a complementary form of transition 5) Enhance and maintain design emphasis on the special nature of each area of Ward 1 through distinctive landscaping and other space features, such as paving, lighting, signs, and street furniture 6) Encourage the development of physical boundaries between commercial concentrations and adjacent residential areas so as to enhance the character and integrity of both sectors in Ward I; and 7) Coordinate efforts with professional design or design-related organizations, historic preservation societies, the general public, and the development community to support policies promoting exemplary design in Ward I SEC. 1200.124. ACTIONS TO IMPLEMENT URBAN DESIGN OBJECTIVES The actions to implement urban design objectives are as follows I) Determine appropriate height, bulk, density, and building materials so that new structures are designed to be harmonous with their surroundings A) Develop a voluntary system of covenants requiring design review and guidelines for facade design and signage in commercial areas B) Reevaluate urban design standards in urban renewal plans in order to better ensure the appropriate design of new development on specific renewal sites C) Develop design standards to guide the District’s review of development proposals for Washington Metropolitan Area Transit Authority owned sites and other sites. 7O EnPoll O~’~.gi D) Consider amending the Zoning Regulations (II DCMR I01 et seq as necessary to make new development compatible with existing buildings in area where rehabilitation or moderate density development goals are primary neighborhood goals, such as Sheridan-Kalorama, Woodley Park, Adams Morgan, Mount Pleasant, S to U Streets area, 16th Street area, Columbia Heights, LeDroit Park 2) Eliminate unsightly billboards and provide better control of signage A) Amend sign regulations to better control placement and size of signs B) In mixed-use districts, restrain signs by size and content above the ground floor level C) Require design review of all Urban Renewal projects development plans 3) Develop better control over the commercial use of public space so as to improve visual appearances; prevent distractions from the enjoyment of public space; reduce pedestrian congestion on the sidewalks; and increase the visual enjoyment of public space A) Amend the laws and regulations on sidewalk cafes and to discourage enclosed sidewalk cafes and to provide better standards for location and design of sidewalk cafes generally B) Amend the current vending regulations as they pertain to appropriate widths of sidewalks to reduce congestion on sidewalks 4) Con~Ict a special study of current design requirements for private development. Undertake streetscape studies to include such areas as 18th and Columbia Road, Mount Pleasant Street, U Street, 14th Street, 18th Street between S and Florida, Connecticut Avenue between Columbia Road and Florida Avenue, and Georgia Avenue 5) Increase and retain street trees in residential and commercial areas in Ward I A) Encourage developers to plant and maintain trees in the public spaces adjoining developments, including such places as the 14th and U Street corridors, 7th Street and Florida Avenue, and Reed-Cooke and other areas in Adams Morgan B) Keep treewells planted with trees and do not permit owners to remove treewells C) Develop a plan to plant and maintain street trees throughout the ward with particular attention to 16th and U Streets, 14th Street and Park Road, and in the medium strip of Sherman Avenue, 18th Street and Columbia Road, 14th Street and Park Road, 18th Street between S Street and Columbia Road, Georgia Avenue, 14th Street, U Street, Mount Pleasant Street 6) Beautify streetscapes and widen sidewalks. 71 ~n~r~lle~ Ori~i~a A) Widen sidewalks at 14th Street near Park Road, 1300 and 1400 blocks of Park Road, 16th and U, 18th and Columbia Road B) Replant and improve median strip on Sherman Avenue C) Consider providing median strip along Calvert Street between the Duke Ellington Bridge and Adams Mill Road SEC. 1200.125. WARD 1 PRESERVATION AND HISTORIC FEATURES a) Ward I, which lies just within and beyond the Old Federal City boundary, represents an important part of the District’s architectural and cultural history. At the end of the 19th century, major corridors, such as Connecticut Avenue, 16th Street, and Columbia Road were lined with mansions and nearby neighborhoods, such as Mount Pleasant, Kalorama, and LeDroit Park, located in many instances along streetcar lines, were being developed rapidly as prestigious suburban enclaves b) Natural features contributed. The escarpment lying between the old and new cities meant that the areas being rapidly developed to the north were felt to have healthier, and in summertime, cooler air. Meridian Hill, Thomas Jefferson’s Meridian point, pinpoints the view down 16th Street (the Avenue of Presidents) to the White House. The two major landmark bridges, linking the developing city east and west across Rock Creek Park, were built in the early 20th century c) The area is rich in cultural history as a home to famous National figures, Presidents, Supreme Court Justices, Congressmen. The LeDroit Park, U Street, and other midcity areas are a major focus for Black cultural history. Early black scholars, writers and artists performed, worked and lived here in the days of segregation. Howard University was established to provide high quality education for blacks and became an important seat of learning for~black scholars and professors precluded from research and t4aching in "white" institutions d) Today some of this history has been recognized through the designation of historic district~ and landmarks. The districts include: LeDroit Park, Kalorama Triangle, Massachusetts Avenue, 16th Street, Strivers Row, and Mount Pleasant. Additional areas and sites are being studied for possible designation e) The District of Columbia Preservation Law in conjunction with Federal Law affords substantial protection to designated landmarks and areas. Nonetheless, development pressures and land use processes such as theiRedevelopment Land Agency RLA and the Zoning Commission do not work in 72 harmony, at least all the time, with the basic purposes of the preservation laws SEC. 1200.126. WARD 1 OBJECTIVES FOR PRESERVATION AND HISTORICAL FEATURES The objectives for preservation and historical features are to preserve the important historic features of Ward 1 while permitting new development that~is compatible with those features SEC. 1200.127. WARD 1 POLICIES IN SUPPORT OF PRESERVATION AND HISTORIC FEATURES OBJECTIVES The policies in support of preservation and historic features objectives are as follows I) Protect and enhance the important historic resources of Ward 1 and the National Capital 2) Provide sufficient administrative flexibility throughout Ward 1 in building codes and other related codes and regulations to permit maximum preservation and protection of historic resources while still ensuring the health and safety of the public 3) Adopt in Ward I development controls and design review criteria that, for particular districts in the ward, reflect the existing, valuable characteristics of the particular historic district or portion thereof; or 4) Ensure that historic buildings in Ward 1 whose significance is embodied in their sites and settings as well as in the buildings themselves, are ~hysically moved only when there is no feasible alternative f~r preservation. If an historic building must be moved, its n4w setting should complement its historic orientation and previous sense of place and integrity. If the relocated building is established on a new site that itself possesses historic significance, its presence should not adversely affect the significance of the new location SEC. 1200.128. ACTIONS TO IMPLEMENT PRESERVATION AND HISTORIC FEATURES The actions to implement preservation and historic features are as follows I) Designate meritorious structUres and areas within Ward 1 as historic landmarks and districts and encourage the retention of existing historic and architecturally significant structures A) Survey potential landmarks and historic areas in Ward I B) Develop historic preservation guidelines for use with historic districts and historic landmarks to govern the physical design, public space, alterations and redevelopment and to ensure that new 73 ~Olle~ Original developments are compatible with the character of individual buildings and districts C) Survey and recommend for listing potential historic preservation areas in the~ward as desirable landmarks or historic districts, as appropriate, such as 13th Street, west side of Florida Av4nu~ from Connecticut Avenue to Massachusetts Avenue a~d portions of other neighborhoods D) Consider designating certain new and/or expanding certain exiting historic districts~ including Connecticut Avenue Historic District (from Florida Avenue to Calvert Street the Strivers Row/Midway District Case #82-2 to include certain Midway Civic Association areas LeDroit Park Historic District (several blocks and the 16th Street Historic District (northward from U Street to Spring Road 2) Strengthen historic preservation laws and regulations, as well as related laws and regulations, and enforce more strongly existing laws A) Amend laws to extend to historic districts the protection afforded proposed historic landmarks from the moment the application on!a historic district is filed B) Portray historic districts on updated maps and consider historic district zoning C) Amend the administrative procedures and notice requirements of the Historic Preservation Review Board to be compatible with those of the Zoning Commission on all actions taken through the Board D) Enforce existing law prohibiting demolitions and alterations of exteriors of historically designated areas, districts, and individual properties without approval process through the Preservation Review Board 3) The L’Enfant Plan city and environs need protection A) Protect Meridian Hill/Malcolm X Park (Thomas Jefferson’s established meridian point and planned area of view from that point to the White HoUse) and the area around it through zoning and historic preservation B) Provide vista and height limitation within the L’Enfant Boundaries and for the escarpment at the edge of these boundaries 4) Many structures in commercial district of Ward 1 are suitable for adaptive reuse and r@habilitation A) Encourage use of programs which are of assistance in encouraging rehabilitation of properties, such as tax credits, facade easements. 7.4 B) Provide information to business people about programs such as business loans offered through OBED and DHCD 5) Restore, protect, and maintain Landmark public facilities in Ward I. Restore the Laddmark Taft and Ellington Bridges to their original form, in61uding removal of the barriers recently installed on the Ellington Bridge SEC. 1200.129. WARD 1 LAND USE a) Ward 1 has 2,018 acres of land, about 5 percent of the total land area of the District. Thelward is geographically small and has less vacant land than any of the other wards. Population is about the same as the other wards, indicating that population density islmuch greater in Ward 1 than in the other wards that have mor~ land b) Land use in Ward I is primarily r4sidential, with the predominant pattern that of rowhouses, a~out 49 percent of the total residential land area. These h~uses are virtually all of masonry construction and of~good quality. Very little housing is single family detached and semi-detached housing; only about 18.8 percedt, and it is concentrated largely in the Sheridan Kalorami area of the ward. The remainder of residential land use!is low-rise, mid-rise, and medium-rise multi-family apartment houses. Not infrequently the residential land use pa£tern involves a mix of rowhouses and low-rise to medium-rise!apartment buildings within the same block face. Many of these residential areas west of 14th street are zoned at apartment house density when, in fact, the predominant[block face pattern is that of rowhouses. This represents a major problem for the ward, as do inadequate zoning controls and lax enforcement, resulting in non-residential uses usurping residential uses in residentially zoned areas c) The commercial areas of the ward tend to be strip-zoned, small business areas with little space for parking or loading, and are usually adjacent to residential neighborhoods. They amount to 5 percent of the total land, a substantial land allocation by comparison with other wards, and have the potential for considerable business development. They are fairly evenly distributed throughout the ward and therefore afford good access to local residents. Retail services needed by local residents are provided unevenly, however, especially in the areas to the east of 16th Street and along Mount Pleasant Street. Considerable economic activity, largely retail and restuarant, is present in the 18th and Columbia Road and Connecticut Avenue/Woodley Park areas, but e~sential and needed services may be replaced by other commercial sues bringing a greater financial return on investment. A major concern in the ward is that of retaining services needed by 75 residents where they are provided and providing needed services where they are lacking d) Commercial areas, such as U Street, 18th and Columbia Road, and Mount Pleasant Street, contain housing, usually combined with commercial uses, in rowhouses, restored fire stations or warehouses, or in apartment houses. The housing is desirable, but there is a tendency to replace it with other uses. Because of this housing, and the proximity of residentially zoned areas, the makeup of commercial districts should be compatible with residential communities e) Industrial land occupies less than I percent of the land and is characterized by small pockets of land containing a hodge-podge of residences and commercial and industrial buildings. Most of this land is not now used for industrial purposes, but rather as commercial/retail and housing. Many of these areas contain deteriorated structures and vacant land. As these areas increasingly become a focus for redevelopment, the housing and some desirable small businesses within them may be lost unless provided for in revised zoning. In the instance in which they are adjacent to Howard University, these areas have become the focus of a revised campus plan f) A substantial amount of land area is devoted to foreign government offices (chanceries) as well as embassies, especially in Sheridan/Kalorama. A continuing concern is whether chanceries (offices) can be located in enclaves established for that purpose and in office zones, rather than in residential areas g) A major goal of the ward continues to be the revitilization of the 14th and U Street corridors and neighboring communities. The situation is complicated by the combined realities of WMATA parcels, off-and-on-again Metro stop development, RLA plan and parcels, possible large scale public/private development consortiums, and the complicated land use mix of zones and uses, vacant and developed land, good housing stock, interesting warehouses, and outmoded structures. A carefully coordinated plan and strategy has yet to be developed which would encourage redevelopment that will not be at the expense of displacement of desirable small businesses and low-scale housing units, and which will assure that the character and density of residential neighborhoods adjacent to these corridors, as well as historic landmarks and districts, will be protected h) Other areas undergoing considerable review include the Reed-Cooke area of Adams Morgan, involving the rezoning of a mixed-use industrial area, and the area to the immediate west of Howard University, which will become part of a greater Howard University planned development. Zoning 76 cases are anticipated to provide additional protection for rowhouses areas i) In a ward of high land use and population density, parks and open spaces occupy only 13 percent of the land as compared with an average of 20.5 for the city as a whole. At the same time the ward has some 31.2 percent of its land in right-of-ways, second only to Ward 2. With the smallest amount of undeveloped land, about two-thirds of the ward’s 4.4 percent private undeveloped land is located in the Shaw and 14th Street Urban Renewal Areas. Additionally, the ward has a higher concentration than most wards (concentrated in a smaller geographical area) of community residence facilities; a more equal distribution citywide is desirable. There is not much leeway for solving land use problems when these considerations are taken into account, so selective rezonings to more desirable uses of land or to improve protection of existing land use patterns is desirable. Density in areas where density is substantial already, such as the 14th Street corridor, should not be increased beyond moderate density, and additional recreation space, open space and parks are needed j) The ward has much land allocated to historic landmarks and historic districts, which in turn are mapped where there is little vacant land. The bulk of the land covered by these districts and landmarks is residential. It is important that land use regulation recognize the importance of conserving these areas SEC. 1200.130. WARD 1 OBJECTIVES FOR LAND USE The objectives for land use are as follows I) To conserve the essentially satisfactory quality of Ward l’s stable residential neighborhoods, to encourage other neighborhoods to improve and achieve stability, to redirect public initiatives to neighborhoods most in need of improvement and stability, to encourage development of adequate neighborhood shopping and support services in all sections of Ward I, to protect residential neighborhoods from disruptive uses and to protect concentrations of non-residential uses on the ward’s residential neighborhoods 2) To promote the vitality of Ward l’s commercial areas, and to provide for the continued growth and vitality of the ward’s economy and employment base 3) To encourage the growth of centers of high technology, research and development, where compatible and with proper residential protection, and to provide for essential support services and non-polluting production throughout Ward I 4) To ensure the availability of sufficient land for Ward l’s public improvement programs and operating 77 Enrolle~ Ori~ine~ needs, to try to convert surplus District-owned land to productive use consistent with the Plan, to improve coordination and development of District-owned land to productive use consistent with the Plan, to improve coordination and management of District government land planning, to increase use of joint public and private development to achieve Ward 1’s goals, to ensure neighborhood stability as non-governmental institutions grow, to develop up-to-date facility plans for District agencies and prepare a District wide public facilities plan, and to promote continued contributions by private institutions toward the economic and cultural vitality of Ward I 5) To concentrate planning on areas of Ward 1 that offer opportunities to accommodate new growth and development, on those that exhibit unique problems or characteristics and require case-specific planning actions on major public institutions, and on areas that require detailed action plans 6) To concentrate planning and development attention on Metrorail Station areas (Shaw, U Street, and Columbia Heights) that offer opportunities for redevelopment and new growth, thus promoting increased ridership for the transit system and enhancing Ward l’s and the District’s economic development efforts; and 7) To coordinate governmental land use decisions with plan provisions, to revise or eliminate obsolete land use regulations affecting Ward I, to improve enforcement of land use regulations, to establish procedures for monitoring public and private land use actions consistent with the Plan policies and to monitor economic and community trends that might require policy modifications SEC. 1200.131. WARD I POLICIES IN SUPPORT OF LAND USE OBJECTIVES The policies in support of land use are as follows I) Promote the conservation, enhancement and revitilization of Ward l’s residential neighborhoods for housing and neighborhood related uses 2) Provide in Ward 1 wide-ranging assistance for neighborhoods of relatively poor quality by joint public and private action and concentrated governmental attention and resources, through measures such as grants and loans for housing purchase and rehabilitation, and land use and possible zoning changes, and with the active involvement and cooperation of the business community, provide service organizations, community development corporations, and other community organizations throughout the ward; 78 ~rolle~ Orlgi 3) Protect Ward l’s residential neighborhoods from generating excessive traffic, noise, litter, and other damaging environmental impacts, by promoting buffering and other techniques to provide for appropriate separation of uses which may, in some cases, suggest modification of the Zoning Regulations and street patterns and strict enforcement of traffic, anti-litter, noise and pollution regulations 4) Promote appropriate commercial development in Ward I, including centers for retail and office uses, to expand employment opportunities for ward residents 5) Promote the improvement and development of local and multi-neighborhood commercial centers in areas of Ward 1 to prevent residents traveling long distances for food and other shopping services, through close coordination of ward and neighborhood planning efforts with the District’s economic development program, including on-going efforts to encourage large food stores to locate in these areas 6) Promote the establishment and growth of residential and mixed use commercial centers at appropriate locations to reduce automobile congestion, improve air quality, increase jobs, reduce reliance on the automobile, and ensure neighborhood stability. Encourage cooperative public and private efforts to increase the use of Metrorail and Metrobus through "park-and-shop" subsidies, shuttle buses, signs, promotional programs, and recommend more selective zoning 7) Encourage joint public and private development of publicly owned or controlled land in Ward 1 to stimulate desired development and to provide an opportunity for the District government to receive monetary and non-monetary returns on public investment in ward I 8) Develop detailed plans for specialized planning areas such as the Reed-Cooke, Howard Gateway, and Columbia Heights, setting forth objectives, policies, and implementation strategies which may include regulatory modifications, land use and recommended zoning changes, program assistance needs, required capital improvements, and impact analysis 9) Prepare Ward I small area action plans to guide specific development pressures, in need of stabilization or improvement, or where short-term economic benefits can be realized through prompt, coordinated actions SEC. 1200.132. ACTIONS TO IMPLEMENT LAND USE OBJECTIVES The actions to implement land use objectives are as follows: 79 ~nrolle~ Origin I) The unsuitable location of certain industrial areas and the deterioration of structures within these areas are having negative effects on the areas and on the adjoining residential neighborhoods, such as Reed-Cooke, 14th and U Streets, Georgia Avenue and V Street A) Change industrial areas in Ward 1 to encourage uses and densities suitable to particular areas, including: 14th Street between S and Chapin Streets below Florida Avenue, U, l~th and 10th Streets i) 14th Street between S and Chapin Streets The areas is characterized by small-scale structures and vacant land abutting low-density residential areas, with the exceptions of the new District of Columbia Office Building, and one large industrial structure. Moderate to medium density commercial and moderate to medium density residential mixed-use zoning is appropriate ii) 7th Street below Florida Avenue This area abuts moderate density residential neighborhood and contains low rise buildings, and one major new development, the Peoples Drug Store. Commercial and mixed use land use is suitable for the Florida Avenue and 7th Street frontage between 7th and T Streets, residential moderate density for the remainder iii) Area between Sherman Avenue, Euclid, Barry Place, and 9th Street The area contains a great deal of land acquired by Howard University and lies between Florida Avenue and Georgia Avenue. The Howard University Campus Plan should be revised further to more nearly delineate potential future use of this landbanking operation iv) Reed-Cooke Encourage the expedition of the Reed-Cooke Phase II zoning case, taking into account theComprehensive Plan objectives for this special treatment area and the revised Reed-Cook Plan of 1989 v) Industrial pockets between Florida Avenue, U, 14th, and 10th Streets Except for l~th Street and U Street areas, this neighborhood should be residential to protect and be compatible with the surrounding residential neighborhoods and to protect the housing within these pockets of industrially zoned land 2) As commercial redevelopment proceeds, completion for parking spaces will increase and may become a problem for adjacent residential areas A) Survey potential site areas to implement Neighborhood Municipal Off-Street Parking Facilities Act of 1980. 8O B) Restrict uses in new and existing mixed-use and commercial buildings which generate substantial traffic and parking problems C) Prevent subdivision of residential buildings without adequate parking 3) The character of residential neighborhoods must be protected from the encroachment of inappropriate nonresidential uses A) Review the definition of nonresidential uses permitted as a matter of right in residential zones to recommend changes needed in the Zoning Regulations B) Review non-residential use work toward deleting some matter-of-right uses, restructuring conditional uses and strengthening certain requirements, such as parking These actions will provide protection of existing housing and provide for new housing while preventing concentration of such uses as galleries bed and breakfast" and other transient operations, private clubs, clinics, museums, hospitals, sanitariums, lodges, fraternity houses, sorority houses, dormitories and non-profit organizations 4) There is an insufficient supply of vacant land in suitable locations to accommodate large-scale economic development projects A) Publish the BZA approved Howard University campus plan and revise to further to reflect proposed uses for the cleared areas it has acquired B) Encourage small scale and rehabilitation projects in existing buildings or on small infill parcels in Ward I 5) Discourage foreign government offices (chanceries) from locating in residential neighborhoods to avoid unnecessary and unacceptable adverse impacts on those neighborhoods. Prevent construction or expansion of chanceries in residential districts where they are not permitted by Zoning Regulations and maps 6) Protect the character of residentially zoned row house neighborhoods by limiting the density of development and preventing intensification of use through the subdivision of structures A) Amend the housing code to require more space per occupant per room B) Enforce the housing regulations to prevent overcrowding within structures C) Enforce the zoning regulations to prevent illegal units and illegal occupancies D) Amend the R4 and R5 zoning regulations to provide the same density standards for R5B that exist for R4. 81 ~uro~ Orig~na E) Sponsor these zoning changes for rowhouse areas in Adams Morgan, the area between 14th and 16th Streets, S and U Streets, and selected areas north of U Street and East of 16th Street, and certain areas along the length of 16th Street and on Connecticut Avenue at selected locations between Florida Avenue and Calvert Street 7) Establish greater control over those uses in commercial areas and in mixed use commercial/residentially zoned neighborhoods that can bring special problems to residents, such as alcohol, drugs, prostitution, and late night noise and traffic A) Increase police patrols in the commercial and mixed use commercial/residential areas in the Ward B) Review the definitions of nonresidential uses to ascertain the need for changes in the Zoning Regulations to ensure that such uses are compatible with surrounding residential development C) Consider amending the Zoning Regulations to limit concentrations of certain uses, such as convenience stores, fast food operations, late night bar operations and other establishments licensed to sell alcohol, in areas in close proximity to residential neighborhoods OP, MPD and DHCD responsible agencies D) Consider amending the Zoning Regulations to prevent late night club operations located near residential areas which draw large crowds, and clarify definitions of "public hall E) Amend ABC Board Laws and regulations further to provide additional controls for residents of mixed-use areas and to encourage late night club-type operations in areas where there is a limited residential population nearby 8) The conservation and redevelopment of commercial areas requires a balanced mix of uses that will attract shoppers, permit economic viability, provide services for local residents and prevent deleterious effects on nearby residential communities. Relevant commercial areas in Ward 1 are: Georgia Avenue and Euclid Street; 18th Street and Columbia Road; Florida and Connecticut Avenues; Mount Pleasant Street; Lower Georgia Avenue; Florida Avenue between 7th and 2nd Streets; U Street;and 14th Street between S and Chapin A) Review the economic and physical conditions of strip commercial corridors to ascertain if zoning changes are needed to support the creation of improved commercial services i) Georgia Avenue above Euclid Street. 82 Enrolled- Original "Conduct studies to ascertain needed services for nearby residents and whether these services should be concentrated in certain locations or spread along the full strip. Retain density, height and mix of uses. Encourage small business development ii) 18th Street and Columbia Road Retain the present mandated mix of residential and commercial uses, as well as the present height and density requirements. Protect apartment buildings and apartments by providing that no commercial uses, such as hotels or other transient uses, can be substituted for the required portion of any building. Prevent sexually-oriented business enterprises. Encourage businesses needed by!a mix of local residents who represent a diversity (ethnically, racially, economically, by age, and by family size The priority of this area is to meet the shopping needs of local residents. Prevent concentrations of liquor-licensed establishments, fast food outlets, and convenience stores iii) Florida and Connecticut Avenues Encourage owners of Universal Building~to rehabilitate the building and improve its exterior appearance. Protect residential character along West side of Connecticut Avenue. Discourage sexually oriented business enterprises. Prevent expansion of hotel and commercial uses into surrounding residential areas, including the West side of Connecticut Avenue and the area behind the Washington Hilton iv) Mount Pleasant Street Maintain and preserve the local neighborhood shopping character of Mount Pleasant Street in order to better serve the immediate neighborhood, including an examination of a possible rezoning of Mount Pleasant Street Encourage use of tax credits for historic preservation projects where appropriate, as well as available programs such as facade grants v) U Street from alley behind 16th Street to l&amp;amp;th Street Retain existing mixed-use residential and commercial charter on North and South sides of U Street between 16th and mid-block 14th and residential land use on the North side vi) U Street at 14th and U Streets Consider mix of residential and commercial land use vii) South of U Street from 7th Street Retain mixed-use residential/ commercial usage and density along South side of U Street viii) 14th Street between S and Chapin Provide for a mix of residential and commercial use. 83 ¯ nrolle~ Original ix) Florida Avenue between 7th and 2nd Streets Encourage rehabilitation of rowhouses and attractive infill development 9) Concentrations of Community-Based Residential "Facilities CBRFs exist throughout Ward I A) Consider changes to the Zoning Regulations to secure a more evenhanded treatment of such uses as community residential facilities, health care facilities, emergency shelter facilities, and similar uses by type, size, and acres of land in Ward I B) Consider changes to the Zoning Regulations to secure a more evenhanded treatment for various zones and a more equal distribution for all the wards C) Secure a better plan for release of residents from various facilities (or in lieu of such facilities such as St. Elizabeth’s and penal institutions D) Reference the District-wide facilities which house various sheltered and emergency shelter populations E) Improve public facilities and government rented facilities which house various sheltered and emergency shelter populations F) Consider other approaches to that of extensive, de-centralized de-institutionalization I0) Appropriate reuse should be determined for abandoned and vacant buildings, public and private, found throughout many areas of the ward A) Study the appropriate reuse for abandoned and vacant buildings B) Inventory vacant and abandoned buildings in the ward and assist with their rehabilitation C) Support planned redevelopment as sites become available. Analyses, where feasible, should be conducted to determine appropriate use D) Encourage Howard University to expedite the update of its campus plan, indicate future use of its property holdings, and identify surplus properties E) Discourage the demolition of buildings which can be used as an alternative to cleared land F) Consider Rezoning of school properties to residential to better control options for possible future use II) Foreign government offices (chanceries) should be discouraged from locating in residential neighborhoods to avoid unnecessary and unacceptable adverse impacts on those neighborhoods A) Enforce the Foreign Missions Act in ways that increase the protection of residential neighborhoods B) Encourage the Federal government to develop enclaves on federal land for chanceries in order to protect residential neighborhoods from non-residential encroachment C) Discourage the expansion of chanceries that are not located in matter-of-right or in "diplomatic overlay" zones 12) Light industries that will provide maximum employment with minimum negative impacts should be encouraged at appropriate locations within the District. Identify, plan, and negotiate compatible uses for selected industrial areas, including manufacturing firms with broad metropolitan markets that are compatible with technology-oriented manufacturing and research and development firms 13) Inappropriate Howard University expansion could have negative impacts on surrounding residential areas, particularly LeDroit Park A) Update Howard University Campus Plan to include properties not otherwise accounted for in the plan and to provide for campus expansion west on qeorgia Avenue into obsolete industrially zoned areas B) Support modification of~Zoning Regulations to require Zoning Commission approval of campus plans, with opportunity for citizen particip@tion, in order to reduce adverse neighborhood impacts and to alleviate uncertainty over future institutional plans And activities C) Enact legislation whichlwill discourage universities, including Howard, from expanding dormitory or other university activities into residentially zoned areas D) Encourage Howard to fix up vacant residential properties for housing 14) The Lincoln Theater, Howard~Theater and U Street corridor have potential as important artistic and cultural additions to the arts district A) Identify additional resources to assist in joint public/private initiatives to reflect the artistic/cultural potential of this area B) Include this area as an~arts, entertainment, and cultural zone with uses compatible with, and not disruptive to, the adjoining residential streets 15) The deterioration and lack 6f industrial buffers in Ward 1 have negative effects on adjoining residential areas, such as Reed-Cooke, 14th and U Streets, Georgia Avenue, Lamont Street area between Sherman Avenue and Georgia Avenue, and Georgia Avenue and VlStreet. 85 ~nrolle~ Ori~Ine A) Allow unsuitable uses, such as public utility stations, certain garages, and gasoline stations to "wither away" and assist industries to relocate within the District, if possible, to a more suitable area B) Locate and structure industrial zones in areas here they can be buffered from residential communities, have access to truck, rail and air transit routes, have substantial acreage, and encourage industrial uses which bring high income to workers, are stable in the economy, and have a high proportion of workers to space utilized C) Consider rezoning areas within industrial areas which are predominately residential to residential 16) Encourage appropriate height, bulk, and density so that new developments are designed to be harmonous with their surroundings. Considerlamending Zoning Regulations as necessary to make new development compatible with existing buildings in areas where rehabilitation and/or moderate density development goals are primary neighborhood goals, such as Sheridan-Kalorama, Woodley Park, Adams Morgan, Mount Pleasant, S to U Streets, 16th~Stree,t area, Columbia Heights, and LeDroit Park. 86 ~nrolle SUBTITLE 2 "SEC. 1200.200 "SEC. 1200.201 "SEC. 1200.202 "SEC. 1200.203 "SEC. 1200.204 "SEC. 1200.205 "SEC. 1200.206 "SEC. 1200.207 "SEC. 1200.208 "SEC. 1200.209 "SEC. 1200.210 "SEC. 1200.211 "SEC. 1200. 212 "SEC. 1200.213 "SEC. 1200.214 "SEC. 1200.215 "SEC. 1200. 216 "SEC. 1200.217 "SEC. 1200. 218 "SEC. 1200.219 "SEC. 1200. 220 "SEC. 1200.221 "SEC. 1200. 222 "SEC. 1200. 223 "SEC. 1200.224 "SEC. 1200.225 "SEC. 1200.226 "SEC. 1200.227 "SEC. 1200.228 "SEC. 1200. 229 "SEC. 1200.230 "SEC. 1200.231 "SEC. 1200.232 WARD 2 PLAN "TABLE OF CONTENTS WARD 2 ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT WARD 2 OBJECTIVES FOR ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT WARD 2 ACTIONS IN SUPPORT OF ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT OBJECTIVES WARD 2 HOUSING WARD 2 OBJECTIVES FOR HOUSING WARD 2 ACTIONS IN SUPPORT OF HOUSING DEVELOPMENT WARD 2 ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION WARD 2 OBJECTIVES FOR ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION WARD 2 ACTIONS IN SUPPORT OF ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION OBJECTIVES WARD 2 TRANSPORTATION WARD 2 OBJECTIVES FOR TRANSPORTATION WARD 2 ACTIONS IN SUPPORT OF TRANSPORTATION OBJECTIVES WARD 2 PUBLIC FACILITIES WARD 2 OBJECTIVES FOR PUBLIC FACILITIES WARD 2 ACTIONS IN SUPPORT OF PUBLIC FACILITIES OBJECTIVES WARD 2 URBAN DESIGN WARD 2 OBJECTIVES FOR URBAN DESIGN WARD 2 ACTIONS IN SUPPORT OF URBAN DESIGN OBJECTIVES WARD 2 PRESERVATION AND HISTORIC FEATURES WARD 2 OBJECTIVES FOR HISTORIC PRESERVATION AND HISTORIC FEATURES WARD 2 ACTIONS IN SUPPORT OF PRESERVATION AND HISTORIC FEATURES OBJECTIVES WARD 2 HUMAN SERVICES WARD 2 OBJECTIVES FOR HUMAN SERVICES WARD 2 ACTIONS IN SUPPORT OF HUMAN SERVICES OBJECTIVES WARD 2 LAND USE WARD 2 OBJECTIVES FOR LAND USE WARD 2 ACTIONS IN SUPPORT OF LAND USE OBJECTIVES WARD 2 ACTIONS IN SUPPORT OF OFFICE DEVELOPMENT WARD 2 OBJECTIVE FOR HOTEL DEVELOPMENT WARD 2 ACTIONS IN SUPPORT OF HOTEL DEVEI~PMENT WARD 2 OBJECTIVE FOR ARTISTIC, CULTURAL, AND EDUCATIONAL USE WARD 2 ACTIONS IN SUPPORT OF ARTISTIC, 87 Enrolled-Orisinal "SEC. 1200.233 "SEC. 1200.234 "SEC. 1200.235 "SEC. 1200.236 "SEC. 1200.237 "SEC. 1200.238 "SEC. 1200. 239 "SEC. 1200. 240 "SEC. 1200. 241 "SEC. 1200.242 CULTURAL, AND EDUCATIONAL LAND USE WARD 2 OBJECTIVES FOR DEVELOPMENT OPPORTUNITY AREAS WARD 2 ACTIONS IN SUPPORT OF DEVELOPMENT OPPORTUNITY AREA OBJECTIVES WARD 2 OBJECTIVE FOR MAJOR INSTITUTIONAL COMPLEXES WARD 2 ACTIONS IN SUPPORT OF MAJOR INSTITUTIONAL COMPLEXES OBJECTIVES WARD 2 NEIGHBORHOOD SHOPPING AREAS OBJECTIVES WARD 2 ACTIONS IN SUPPORT OF THE NEIGHBORHOOD SHOPPING AREAS OBJECTIVES WARD 2 WATERFRONT DEVELOPMENT OBJECTIVE WARD 2 ACTIONS IN SUPPORT OF THE WATERFRONT DEVELOPMENT OBJECTIVE WARD 2 METRO STATION DEVELOPMENT OBJECTIVE WARD 2 ACTIONS IN SUPPORT OF THE METRO STATION DEVELOPMENT OBJECTIVE "SEC. 1200.201. WARD 2 ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT a) The continuing expansion of the city’s economy, in terms of jobs, business development opportunities and tax revenues, is a high priority for the District government. Major efforts are underway to increase economic development throughout the city, especially in outlying commercial centers. Ward 2 is in almost all respects the economic engine of the city. As the center of the city and region, employment in Ward 2 is greater than in the other seven wards b) The average wage and salary employment figure in 1986 the city was 640,600 employees. Over half of this total is estimated to be in Ward 2. In addition, there are probably another 30,000 employees in the self-employed and international agency categories. Many of these people also work in Ward 2. The greatest amount of development activity is concentrated in Ward 2, as described in the land use section. Major development is now underway in the Downtown area between the Capitol and the White House, with significant development also underway in the Connecticut Avenue and K Street area, and the West End. Development is moving eastward and future development will take place in the North Capitol Street area and in the South Capitol Street/Buzzard Point area. Additional development and reuse of buildings for federal employment is also proposed for the Southeast Federal Center/Navy Yard area c) Most of the future employment growth will be in office employment. Ward 2 has traditionally been the 88 Fmrolled Ori~i~93~ location of the "three A’s attorneys, accountants, and associations) that make up much of the District’s private sector employment. New jobs are being created in communications, finance, and "high-tech" sales. Jobs in the hospitality industry, especially hotel related jobs, are also increasing d) The employment structure in any dynamic city is constantly changing. The District’s employment growth strategy must seek to retain and increase existing jobs while also seeking to attract new types of jobs. Employment in the city, and in Ward 2, is growing fastest in the private sector e) However, it is important to retain and increase federal jobs in Ward 2. Development of the International Cultural and Trade Center in the Federal Triangle, the Southeast Federal Center, and the Navy Yard are important to retain federal and international agency jobs f) In 1980, 88 percent of employed Ward 2 residents worked in the city, the highest percentage of any ward. Citywide, about 81 percent of employed residents worked in the city. One of the great advantages of living in Ward 2 is the proximity to work; most Ward 2 residents also work in Ward 2. Many Ward 2 residents can walk to work, or have only a short commute by public transit. These Ward 2 residential communities need to be kept healthy and vibrant as this unique residential character in Ward~2 enhances the Central Business District g) The skill level of Ward 2 residents is not fully matched with the jobs available. In 1980, nearly half of all employed residents in the ward were in managerial, professional and technical occupations. This percentage has probably increased since that time, as new residents have moved into the ward to be near the growing office employment in the Central Employment Area. On the other hand, 1980 census data indicated that 22 percent of the ward’s population was in poverty. These residents have low-paying jobs or are unemployed. It is important to create entry-level jobs, such as those found in the hospitality industry. Job training programs are needed to allow these residents to move up the employment ladder h) The improvement of neighborhood and community commercial areas has several economic development implications. Retail stores and services are an amenity that help retain and attract residents to Ward 2. To a large extent, Ward 2 residents are a captive market, and will usually buy groceries and other daily necessities in the neighborhood, thus retaining purchasing power in the community. Finally, neighborhood stores and services provide employment to Ward 2 and other District residents. 89 gnrolle~ Or~ginal SEC. 1200.202. WARD 2 OBJECTIVES FOR ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT The objective for economic development are as follows I) Enhance the image of Ward 2 as a place to do business and to reside 2) Maintain sound areas of the ward and to rebuild and develop other areas of the ward where economic development actions are needed 3) Increase total employment in the ward, especially in the Central Employment Area, and at appropriate locations and levels in other areas of the ward 4) Increase employment for District residents, especially Ward 2 residents, within the Ward 2 employment base 5) Spur growth of the "visitor industry" by attracting additional visitors of all types and increasing their average length of stay in Washington 6) Retain existing businesses and develop new businesses, with special emphasis on small and minority business development. Businesses located out of Downtown should be compatible with the needs of adjacent residential neighborhoods 7) Utilize the potential of the District’s universities, especially in Ward 2, as well as existing and future museums, galleries, theaters and other cultural facilities, to create an expanded center of knowledge and learning in the center of Washington 8) Increase District tax revenues from expanded economic development activity in Ward 2 SEC. 1200.203. WARD 2 ACTIONS IN SUPPORT OF ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT The actions in support of economic development are as follows I) Focus special economic development programs in non-residential areas 2) Establish a policy framework for development of the South Capitol Street/Buzzard Point area 3) Encourage office employment growth outside residential use areas, in new development in Downtown, in other areas of the Central Employment Area, and in other Development Opportunities Areas 4) Increase employment in traditional public and private sector office jobs and in new types of jobs in communications, information industries, and high-technology sales and research. Special efforts are needed to increase jobs in the Central Employment Area in the face of suburban competition A) Continue to implement the Downtown Plan, including strengthening the Downtown Partnership and 9O encouraging development in other parts of the Central Employment Area B) Work with the National Capital Planning Commission (NCPC) and the General Service Administration (GSA) to increase federal employment in the ward and near the Central Employment Area C) Encourage the Office of Business and Economic Development (OBED) to work with local universities to create economic development programs 5) Encourage new retail employment in the Central Employment area, especially in Downtown 6) Achieve, where appropriate, retail and service development at the neighborhood commercial areas of the ward outside the Central Employment Area, while respecting the scale and needs of the adjacent neighborhoods A) Take actions to capitalize on economic opportunities near new Metrorail stations outside the Central Employment Area, including Mount Vernon Square/UDC, Shaw, Waterfront and Navy Yard stations, all opening in the early 1990s B) Urge the Office of Business and Economic Development (OBED) to target special programs to improve neighborhood and community shopping areas, including 17th Street, N.W 14th Street, N.W Seventh Street, N.W H Street, N.E. and Waterside Mall C) Work with private owners to find ways to develop parking areas, where possible and appropriate, for neighborhood and community commercial areas 7) Increase the promotion of the ward’s and the city’s hospitality industry to attract additional visitors and to provide additional visitor amenities and services A) Continue to work with the Convention Center Board to expand and improve Convention Center facilities B) Work with the hospitality industry to provide information on lesser known points of interest in Ward 2 8) Special efforts shall be made to retain existing businesses and to attract new businesses, especially small and minority-owned businesses. The Minority Business Opportunity Commission (MBOC) and OBED shall continue to increase programs to return and attract small and minority businesses to Downtown and other sections of the Central Employment Area by identifying locations in neighborhood retail centers where there are small and minority business opportunities, and providing special assistance and support if required SEC. 1200.204. WARD 2 HOUSING. 91 a) Changes in the ward’s housing stock during the last several years reflect city-wide trends. Perhaps no other ward in the city has such a diverse hoUsing stock as Ward 2. Restoration in Dupont Circle, Logan~Circle and now Shaw has helped these neighborhoods regain mUch of their past prominence. They are close to Downtown, Connecticut Avenue and K Street and are well served by mass transit. Much of the neighborhoods’ attraction lies in the beauty of their urbane architecture and tree-lined streets. They are also long lasting reminders of the city’s growth from L’Enfant’s original plan to today’s international city b) Equally interesting are the Foggy Bottom and Georgetown neighborhoods. Both once contained industrial areas and included gas works, glass companieS, breweries, and warehouses. Most of these buildings arelgone, removed to make way for the later office, retail and~residential development. Foggy Bottom is a mix of old alley houses, such as those on Hughes Mews, townhouses, mid-rise apartments and condominiums as well as the headquarters of the Department of State. Georgetown, too, has retalned much of its historic housing, with quaint alley dwellings and beautifully restored rowhouses c) Southwest is one of the city’s more contemporary neighborhoods. Developed from a massive early 1950s urban renewal program, the southwest housing stock[combines garden apartments, townhouses and high-rise apartments. A popular place for young singles and families, Southwest offers an attractive waterfront and green open space as well as the city’s open-air seafood market d) But with the success of restoration and new housing development have also come disturbing trends. The ward has the largest number of public housing units in the city. Most are in the southwest/southeast and near northeast sections of the ward. Unfortunately, many of these units are in disrepair and are overcrowded. Housing for the elderly is in short supply. Many apartments are being renovated and returned to the housing stock as upscale rental units or condominiums e) Abandoned units, particularly in the 14th Street, lower Logan Circle and Shaw neighborhoods cause serious problems. Not only do ’they contribute to the shortage of affordable housing and are neighborhood eyesores, they are often havens for drug addicts and other illegal activity. Housing conditions in the north Stanton Park~neighborhood range from sound to poor. Some restoration is taking place, but many units are in disrepair. Neighborho6d organizations representing the Shaw Area often complain about the displacement of elderly and low-moderate income persons by renovating activities. Residents of Foggy Bottom, 92 ~Enrolle~ Orisinal Georgetown, Dupont Circle,and Southwest note rising housing costs and tax tax assessments asproblems f) Even with these problems, the ward’s housing stock continues to improve. The Department Of Housing and Community Deyelopment (DHCD) has programmed large-scale renovations for the ward’s public housing stock. Among those units that have been upgraded or are p~oposed for improvements are Syphax, James Creek, Greenleaf and Arthur Capper. The Greenleaf high rise will be renovated as housing for the elderly, as was one of the Arthur Capper high-rise buildings. Various programs are available through DHCD to assist low- and moderate-income families in renting or purchasing units. The District has made a commitment to retain its publicly owned housing inventory intact, making improvements and alleviating the lack of affordable low-income housing g) Institutional growth, commercial expansion and rising housing costs have had negative impacts on Foggy Bottom. The Comprehensive Plan and its requirement for updated campus master plans will help limit non-residential growth that had begun to diminish the neighborhood’s housing stock. Construction of the Shaw Metrorail Station at Seventh and R Streets, N.W. has helped to spark renewed interest in this neighborhood. Restoration has begun to revitalize the housing stock. Developers are including housing in concepts for creating a new environment at Mt. Vernon Square. In near Northeast, restoration has begun to enliven the area east of Union Station. Through its commitment to H Street, N.E the city has clearly indicated its intention to improve the Stanton Park neighborhood h) The Navy Yard Metrorail Station ow well under construction, will connect Downtown with neighborhoods in far Southeast. Its completion will spark redevelopment in nearby areas. The vast acreage stretching south from M Street, S.E. to the Anacostia shoreline has been overlooked for years. Although several redevelopment proposals have been prepared, none have been carried out i) Now there is a new impetus to develop the South Capitol Street/Buzzard Point area. Concept plans include mixed office, retail, recreational and residential space. Successful completion of this project will be a major step in the revitalization of this key area of the city j) The Comprehensive Plan designated Mt. Vernon Square, Market Square, Arthur Capper, Fourth ~and M Streets, S.E Greenleaf Gardens, and Syphax Gardens as Housing Opportunity Areas. A Housing Opportunity Area is one in which the District encourages new or renovated housing through public-private partnerships or other means. Perhaps the most exciting Housing Opportunity Areas are those at Market Square and Pennsylvania Avenue, N.W. 93 k) Not since the 153-unit Wah Luck House was completed in 1980 has there been significant~new housing in Downtown. In fact, units scattered throughout Downtown have been razed to to permit new office and retail growth. The Pennsylvania Avenue Development Corporation (PADC) has proposed to construct a total of &amp;amp;21 units in two Downtown projects. PADC is proposing renovation of the Lansburgh’s Department Store that will include housing I) With renovation underway in Shaw and the potential for housing in Downtown and Buzzard Point, the ward’s housing stock should see a period of growth during the next five to I0 years. But perhaps more!importantly, the District is committed to providing funds~to help low- and moderate-income families continue to reside in Ward 2, and thereby retain its ethnic and economic diversity SEC. 1200.205. WARD 2 OBJECTIVES FOR HOUSING The objectives for housing are as follows I) Stimulate production of new and rehabilitated housing to meet all levels of need and demand, and to provide incentives for the types of housing needed at desired locations 2) Provide for the housing needs of low- and moderate-income households 3) Improve the low-rent housing program 4) Encourage ownership 5) Reduce the overall cost of housing among low- and moderate-income households 6) Provide regulatory, enforcement, and financial programs to protect, maintain and enhance the District’s housing supply, and to strengthen private and public neighborhood services and facilities to support the District’s housing programs SEC. 1200.206. WARD 2 ACTIONS IN SUPPORT OF HOUSING OBJECTIVES The actions in support of housing objectives are as follows I) Encourage the private sector to provide new housing to meet the needs of present and future District residents at locations consistent with District land-use policies and objectives 2) Recognize the importance of the lending industry in housing development, identify sites where new housing is to be encouraged, and, in selected cases, provide incentives for desired development 3) Review and recommend suitable regulatory, zoning, tax and financing incentives under appropriate controls to meet housing production goals, particularly for low- and moderate-income and elderly households. 94 4) Work with owners and community groups to identify vacant housing units suitable for rehabilitation to make restoration of vacant units to the housing stock a major government priority. The Department of Housing and Community Development shall accelerate the return of abandoned buildings to the active residential real estate market 5) Establish, as a matter of major governmental priority, the production of housing for low- and moderate-income households in Ward 2, particularly Downtown A) Explore housing incentives such as tax incentives and land cost write down to encourage housing in the Downtown area B) Encourage the inclusion of housing units in appropriate locations in all commercial areas with particular incentives for the central city at designated mixed-use areas and at Metrorail stops 6) In order to maintain the City’s housing supply, the Department of Housing and Community Development (DHCD) shall expedite review of reported use~violations of residential properties in the Southwest Urban Renewal Area; quickly issue cease and desist orders as indicated; and, as a final step in enforcement, take to Court those who do not conform to the Plan. DHCD has this responsibility, and flagrant abuse of the Plan has led to parking, traffic, and trespassing problems, as well as a reduction ~in the number of residential units available for citizen housing 7) The ward has a high percentage of older units in its housing stock. These units must be made more energy-efficient in relation to home maintenance costs. The Building Code Advisory Commission should continue to update the codes as necessary, incorporating energy considerations for new and rehabilitated housing construction and the D.C. Energy Office shall continue to publicize programs for home energy conservation 8) Improve neighborhood-level commercial services throughout the ward while at the same time protecting residential neighborhoods from disruptive uses. Promote public/private business partnershipsithrough OBED and other programs to support small neighborhood businesses. Implement OBED’s Neighborhood Commercial Revitalization Program concepts in the 14th Street and Seventh Street corridors, and implement and education program for merchants to aid them in improving promotion and management of neighborhood stores 9) Increase new construction and maintenance of rental housing and increase enforcement of h6using codes in the ward. The city, in conjunction with nonlprofit organizations and private investors, shall explore ways of increasing the supply of rental housing. The Department of 95 Consumer and Regulatory Affairs (DCRA) shall expand housing code violation enforcement procedures and develop methods of penalizing property owners who are chronic offenders I0) An important element causing housing problems has been the destruction of housing to provide commercial and institutional buildings, and hotels and medical clinics. In addition, current zoning regulations permit the conversion of housing stock in residential neighborhoods to medical clinics and doctor’s offices. To improve the housing stock and to prevent further loss of housing through replacement of residential housing by the construction of housing that is for other than genuinely residential purposes, adjustments will need to be made to existing zoning regulations and to campus plans SEC. 1200.207. WARD 2 ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION a) Environmental protection has taken on national importance during the last 15 years. Research has identified specific correlations between the iquality of the environment and health. The aging process, Work productivity, and mental health are among ma~y aspects of life affected by changes in environmental quality b) Ward 2 has a variety of urban envlronmental conditions. Many of the ward’s environmental problems are the result of its land use activity pattern The ward is the center of the metropolitan region’s emplqyment, retail, and tourist areas. It is also the city’s transit hub. The confluence of the Potomac and Anacostia Rivers is at the southern end of the ward c) Due to the daily influx of vehicl4s in the ward buses, taxis, cars, and trucks exhaust emissions are a major problem, particularly in Downtown and other employment and retail areas. Poor air quality has had a negative effect on street trees and contributes to deterioration of buildings and monuments, as well as to the public health d) The ward’s concentrated residential population, its large work force and year-round tourism result in the generation of a large amount of waste e) Noise pollution is often associated with the numerous construction sites in Downtown, West End, and Southwest, and at Metrorail. In addition, noise results from traffic and emergency vehicles, and air traffic for National Airport f) The Environmental Protection Element of the Comprehensive Plan addresses the need to all~viate the adverse effects of poor environmental quality. The element contains policies directed toward improving air quality, developing safe solid waste, sludge disposal, and enforcing public health and sanitation standards. Various District government agencies such as the Department of Public Works 96 Enrolle~ Ori~i~e DPW) and Department of Consumer and Regulatory Affairs (DCRA) are already implementing programs to improve the city’s environmental quality. The Metropolitan Washington Council of Governments (COG) interacts with local jurisdictions to improve the region’s environmental quality g) The District, Prince Georges County, Maryland and federal governments have entered into a partnership to cleanup the Anacostia River. The river is in poor condition, with sediment and high bacteria levels making it virtually uninhabitable for aquatic life h) A computerized sewage treatment plant is being constructed just east of D.C. General Hospital. However, without the combined efforts of the government and area residents, the Anacostia will continue to deteriorate i) The Potomac River has been improved. Fish and plant life have made a remarkable recovery and, according to a recent Council of Government report, some Sections of the river are nearly suitable for swimming. Pollution levels in the river are the lowest in several decades.° The dramatic recover of the Potomac was the result of the~combined efforts of local and federal governments and~area residents j) Conditions along the shorelines, however, need improvement. The Potomac shoreline from Key~Bridge to Fort Leslie J. McNair has benefitted from recent developments, but the Anacostia shoreline has not received!similar attention. From Buzzard Point to the Navy Yard, the Anacostia west bank is in need of improvement. Seawalls are required to secure the shoreline against erosion. Walkways, lights, benches, picnic areas, and marinas w~uld make this section of the Anacostia an attractive addition to this city’s waterfront k) There is a new commitment to upgrade the quality of the District’s environment. With recovery of the Potomac River and other similar efforts, a new era of environmental improvement is beginning for the Anacostia. Proposals for both shorelines are heightening the need for~better management of the city’s waterfronts. The District, like other large cities, is implementing new technology for solid waste disposal. Regular and bulk trash pickup schedules have been improved, lessening debris in the ward’s neighborhoods. In addition, the city’s 20-year storm water abatement plan is underway. The Swirl Concentrator will reduce pollution levels in the Anacostia while helping reduce the volume of waste treated at Blue Plains. DPW has upgraded its street tree maintenance program SEC. 1200.208. WARD 2 OBJECTIVES FOR ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION "The objectives for environmental protection are as follows: 97 I) Improve the quality of water in the rivers and streams of the District to meet public health and water quality standards, and to maintain physical, chemical, and biological integrity of these watercourses for multiple uses, including recreation 2) Improve the quality of the air of the District and its region so as to meet public health standards 3) Protect the overall environmental quality of the District’s land areas by preventing further soil erosion, promoting the restoration of eroded!areas, and enforcing prohibitions against illegal dumping and other destructive practices 4) Improve and develop safe andieffective methods of collection, management and disposal of solid waste and sewage sludge 5) Promote water conservation in order to ensure adequate supplies of potable water atiall times and reduce discharges into the rivers SEC. 1200.209. WARD 2 ACTIONS IN SUPPORT OF ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION The actions in support of environmental protection are as follows I) Pollution of the Potomac and~Anacostia Rivers continues to be a major environmental concern in the ward A) Continue support of regional and interstate efforts to limit upstream pollution from sewage, construction, and agricultural uses B) Improve regulation of houseboats and other floating structures in the Washington Channel Marina to reduce water pollution C) Encourage the National Park Service to rebuild riverbanks to stop erosion adjacent to Rock Creek and West Potomac Parks D) Clean up industrial areas of the Anacostia West Bank, as well as clean up the!Maine Avenue Fish Market; require frequent trash removal regrade and repave right-of-way parking, and loading areas E) Encourage the National Park Service to adopt programs for removal of trash accumulations on tidal flats adjacent to East Potomac Park F) Support research on positive and negative effects of hydrilla in the Potomac to satisfy conflicting public concerns G) Ensure the retention of!open space in new waterfront development H) Work with the National Park Service to develop a water recreation center on the Ana6ostia’s West 98 EnrOlled Original Bank below the Navy Yard similar to Thompson’s Boat House on the Potomac I) Urge the Recreation Advisory Board to create a subcommittee for waterfront recreation 2) Reduce trash and litter in outdoor spaces throughout the ward A) Urge DPW to increase weekend trash pick-ups in congested areas B) Enforce requirements for an exterior trash removal plan as part of the business of licensing of carry out/fast food/convenience stores C) Address problems of dumpsters located in public space or parking areas through enforcement of existing regulations D) Encourage Advisory Neighborhood Commissions (ANCs) to develop and announce neighborhood clean-up campaigns in conjunction with the special city trash removal schedule E) Establish city trash clean-up program for grounds and public spaces in vacant public housing projects and other city-owned property F) DCRA shall require that applicants for demolition permits submit plans for cleanup, ground cover, fencing/screening, and trash removal 3) Reduce air pollution. Encourage WMATA to find better ways to vent bus exhausts and upgrade emission standards in new bus acquisitions. Study the feasibility of auto-free areas 4) Address causes of noise pollution in the ward A) Work with the Metropolitan Washington Airports Authority to improve airport operations and reduce noise, especially in Ward 2 B) Work with Washington Metropolitan Area Transit Authority (WMATA) to reduce bus noise for new buses, especially during acceleration C) Enforce prohibition on operations of intercity buses (including charter tour buses) on all city streets other than arterials; prohibit parking or standing with motor running except while boarding or debusing passengers D) Enforce noise limits for operations of trucks within the city, including city-owned trucks, refuse trucks, and cement trucks E) The Department of Consumer and Regulatory Affairs (DCRA) shall enforce restrictions on the operation of construction equipment by lim~.tations on building permits to the hours of 7 a.m. to 5 p.m. weekdays at any location in or within 500 feet of a residentially 99 zoned district and prohibit construction operations in such areas on Sundays F) Prohibit installation or use of burglar alarms that generate an audible signal for more than 15 minutes except where police authorities or on-duty security guards have access to premises 5) Improve natural resources planning and management within Ward 2 A) Encourage the Department of Recreation, working with the National Park Service to improve existing programs that maintain and enhance Ward 2’s parks and open spaces B) Encourage the Zoning Commission to establish an open space zone designation to protect the ward’s privately owned parks, cemeteries, etc C) Ensure that street and highway planning is consistent with Federal standards for permissable levels of traffic vibration, noise, and air pollution, and that it reduces to a minimum the impact of non-local traffic on residential streets. Land use patterns and transportation planning should strive to decrease reliance on automobiles SEC. 1200.210. WARD 2 TRANSPORTATION a) Transportation is a vital part of urban life. The special nature of transportation services and impacts in Ward 2 results from the location of the ward at the center of the city and region, at the focal point of the Metrorail system, bus lines, the freeway and arterial street system. In many respects, residents of Ward 2, and employees who work in Ward 2, enjoy the best transportation access and service of any area in the city. At the same time, this location at the hub of the region’s transportation system produces some adverse impacts on the quality of life in the ward b) Metrorail has been the single most important factor in improving transportation access to the center of Washington. Ward 2 is at the center of the Metrorail system, which includes the Red, Orange, Blue, Yellow, and Green Lines. Within the ward, there are now 19 Metrorail stations in operation and four under construction on the Green Line. The Mount Vernon Square/UDC and Shaw stations and the U Street Station in Ward i, will open in late 1990. The Waterfront and Navy Yard stations and the Anacostia Station in Ward 8 will open in late 1991 c) These Metrorail lines now bring about 200,000 riders per day into central Washington, primarily into Ward 2. Ward residents enjoy excellent Metrorail access to jobs in the Central Employment Area, or for "reverse commuting" trips to outlying jobs. Since the stations are so close together at the center of the system, Metrorail also serves I00 as a convenient neighborhood transit system for Ward 2 residents and employees d) Ward 2 is also the focal point for the Metrobus system with nearly I00 Metrobus routes running through the ward. Most of these routes converge on the Central Employment Area e) Ward 2 is also the focus of major arterial streets feeding into the Central Employment Area. Arterials such as Wisconsin, Massachusetts, Connecticut, Georgia, New York, Maryland, and Pennsylvania Avenues carry automobile and truck traffic into the center city from outlying District neighborhoods and from the Maryland suburbs. To’ the south, traffic from Virginia moves across the Potomac River into Ward 2 over the Key, Theodore Roosevelt, Memorial, and 14th Street Bridges. Traffic from the eastern sections of the District and Maryland enters Ward 2 over the South Capitol Street and llth Street Bridges across the Anacostia River. On a typical workday, 170,800 vehicles come into the central area of the city f) Once in the city, auto and truck traffic move over two types of street systems. The first is the system of diagonal avenues with an overlay of grid streets, a pattern derived from the L’Enfant Plan. The wide avenues and streets of this system are efficient for moving traffic, but the flow is complicated by the pattern of circles and squares g) The second type of system is the freeway system, consisting of the Southwest and Southeast freeways, the Center Leg Freeway and the Whitehurst Freeway along the Georgetown Waterfront. The section of the Center Leg Freeway from Massachusetts Avenue north to New York Avenue was opened in March 1987 h) In the late 1960s District citizens and the District government made a decision to limit freeway construction in favor of neighborhood preservation and Metrorail construction in order to stress urban and human values. No other freeway extensions are planned in Ward 2 i) Major volumes of automobile and service traffic must pass through Ward 2 neighborhoods, primarily along arterial routes, to reach the Central Employment Area. This traffic has some adverse impacts on these neighborhoods j) Parking is a problem in the Central Employment Area. Even with increased Metrorail use, parking demands arise with increased employment growth. There is a special need to provide short-term parking for retail customers, especially in Downtown k) Parking in the residential neighborhoods of Ward 2 is also a problem as the number of households increases. Since many dwellings do not have off-street parking, cars compete for limited on-street spaces. Many of the Ward 2 I01 neighborhoods are adversely affected by spillover parking from the Central Employment Area. Some neighborhoods, such as Georgetown, Foggy Bottom, and Dupont Circle, are also affected by evening visitors to restaurants, bars and entertainment. Spillover parking problems are only partially alleviated by the neighborhood parking program i) Taxicab activity is concentrated in the central part of the city. Ward 2 residents and employees have the best taxi service in the city, but are still subject to many of the problems of current taxi operations. Improved and innovative taxi service such as additional cabstands and better call service could benefit Ward 2 m) Pedestrian movement is the largest and most efficient means of transportation in Ward 2. Every workday, the over 400,000 employees in the ward walk hundreds of thousands of miles in the Central Employment Area and in other parts of Ward 2. Visitors and shoppers also walk many hundreds of thousands of miles in the ward; many residents can walk to shopping, entertainment, and cultural activities. Improvement of the safety and attractiveness of the pedestrian environment would encourage additional walking, a very worthwhile transportation investment. Residents would benefit from the construction of additional housing in areas adjacent to the Central Employment Area without unduly affecting the transportation system n) Commuter railroad service comes into Union Station from the Maryland suburbs. Commuter train service from Virginia is planned. More importantly, intercity Amtrak passenger service is provided from Union Station. Ward 2 residents, employees, and visitors have easy access to National Airport by way of Metrorail, taxi, and private automobile. At the same time, the noise caused by use of National Airport has an adverse impact on some Ward 2 neighborhoods, especially on Southwest, Foggy Bottom, West End, and Georgetown. Intercity bus service is provided from the new Trailways and Greyhound Terminal at First and L Street, N.E o) Bicycles also have considerable potential as a means of transportation in Ward 2. Bicycle use is relatively limited compared to the potential, but bicycle commuting by Ward 2 residents and others coming into the Central Employment Area is increasing. Bicycles are also heavily used by couriers in the central city area. Off-hour and weekend recreational use is probably as significant as the use of bicycles for the journey to work. Safety of bicyclists and security of parked bicycles are major concerns. Bicycles should be banned from sidewalks south of Florida Avenue, N.W. due to the residential character of the neighborhoods and due to the narrow sidewalks. 102 p) The D.C. Bicycle Advisory Council has recommended a Bicycle Transportation Plan for the District of Columbia (June 1987 The recommended plan proposes a network of bike routes extending through Ward 2. The plan recommends additional study of bicycle use and safety improvements in the Central Employment Area q) Other forms of transportation in the Ward include boat service on the Potomac and Anacostia rivers and limited helicopter services SEC. 1200.211. WARD 2 OBJECTIVES FOR TRANSPORTATION The objectives for transportation are as follows i) Increase transportation access to the Central Employment Area 2) Improve mobility within Ward~2 for residents, employees and visitors, while minimizing adverse transportation impacts on commercial areas and residential neighborhoods SEC. 1200.212. WARD 2 ACTIONS IN SUPPORT OF TRANSPORTATION OBJECTIVES The actions in support of transportation objectives are as follows I) Increase use of public transit and taxis A) Encourage WMATA to makeloperational improvements to the Metrorail system by extehding operating hours, improving lighting and directional signage in and around the stations, establishing a policy that at least one "up" escalator is operating at all times, and announce the beginning and end of rush hours B) Encourage the D.C. Taxicab Commission to give special attention to new taxi services that will improve service in Ward 2 and reduce the need for private automobile use in the center of the city 2) Improve access to, and transportation efficiency within, the Central Employment Area and other areas where new development is occurring A) The Department of Public Works (DPW) shall improve circulation around the Mount Vernon Square area and the West End to reduce traffic impacts in adjacent neighborhoods B) DPW shall complete the installation of the automated traffic control system now underway and check adequacy of traffic signals for pedestrian safety and efficient vehicle flow C) In order to improve traffic flow, increase Police/DPW enforcement of regulations for vehicles illegally blocking street lanes. Also increase enforcement and removal of vehicles parked on sidewalks and public space. 103 3) Maintain and improve streets and freeways in Ward 2, and to improve streets in major Urban Renewal areas including Downtown, Northeast One, Northwest One, Lower Shaw, Southwest and H Street, N.E A) DPW shall increase its program for the repair, reconstruction and redesign of streets, alleys, and freeways. Include new sidewalks, curbs, and storm drain covers, where appropriate B) DPW shall undertake a special study of future street construction needs in the North Capitol Street, Navy Yard, near Southeast and Buzzard Point area C) The city should consider pedestrian and bicycle needs when streets are redesigned and improved 4) Provide sufficient parking in the Central Employment Area and to provide adequate parking in both residential and commercial areas A) The city and Downtown merchants should adopt public/private parking management programs in the Central Employment Area where needed, in order to provide parking for short-term retail and business patrons and to discourage all-day commuter parking; and develop special parking/loading programs for community commercial areas, with emphasis on problem parking areas, subject to the approval of the affected ANC B) Explore innovative methods of providing additional parking such as leasing parking spaces at public facilities to parking operators for evening and weekend use in areas where parking is a problem, subjectito the approval of the affected ANC C) Strictly adhere to current parking requirements of the zoning regulations and expeditiously implement the Municipal Off-Street Parking Act D) DPW shall require parking lot owners in residential and commercial districts to maintain public space in front of lots. Further, parking lots should be required to be screened, landscaped, fenced and locked up at night or when closed 5) Increase pedestrian movement and safety and improve the pedestrian environment A) Develop and implement plans for streetscape and pedestrian improvements in Downtown and other sections of the Central Employment Area B) Develop adequate pedestrian walkways in areas of future development, including North Capitol Street, South Capitol Street/Buzzard Point, and the Southeast Federal Center/Navy Yard C) Improve special connecting pedestrian routes such as M Street between Connecticut Avenue and Georgetown; Second Street, N.E Union Station and H Street; the Monumental Core and Downtown, and pathways 104 Enrolle~ Origi~ alongwaterfront areas in Georgetown and the Buzzard Point area D) Develop plans to improve pedestrian movement and safety in the Dupont Circle area E) DPW shall ensure that existing pedestrian ways are maintained, and require wider covered walkways, firmer flooring, and substantial overhead protection during the construction of new buildings F) DPW shall publicize its repair program for older commercial districts where sidewalks have deteriorated 6) Implement the city’s Bicycle Plan recommendations for Ward 2 and undertake additional study of bicycle use within the Central Employment area, with particular emphasis on bicycle safety, parking, and security 7) Encourage innovative transportation by water 8) Support land use policies that encourage better use of transportation services such as concentrating employment in the Central Employment Area, locating development near Metrorail stations, and developing new housing within walking distance of the Central Employment Area SEC. 1200.213. WARD 2 PUBLIC FACILITIES a) There are a number of public facilities throughout Ward 2 that make essential services available to all members of the community. These facilities include schools, parks, recreation centers, libraries, fire and police stations and general public works b) There are presently 20 public schools in Ward 2, including 13 elementary schools, four junior high schools, one senior high school, an elementary art center and a special education school c) The University of the District of Columbia is requesting funds in the FY 1988 Capital Improvements Budget for the design and project management of a new campus, at Seventh Street and Mount Vernon Square in Ward 2. Three private universities are also located in the ward: Georgetown, George Washington and Southeastern. Georgetown is in the process of expanding its law school at New Jersey Avenue and G Street within Ward 2 d) The District of Columbia public library is funded by the city government and administered by an appointed Board of Trustees. Ward 2 is served by the main library, the Martin Luther King, Jr. Memorial Library, in which the nationally acclaimed King Mural is on permanent display. Branch libraries in Ward 2 include: Watha T. Daniel, Southwest, Georgetown, West End and Sursum Corda Community 105 Enrolled~Or~glnal Libraries. The UDC Mount Vernon Campus Library, in the old Carnegie Library building, provides limited library service e) The headquarters of the D.C. Metropolitan Police Department (MPD) is located in Ward 2 at 300!Indiana Avenue, N.W. Ward 2 is served by three districts of the Metropolitan Police Department. They are the First District Station, 415 Fourth Street, S.W the SecondDistrict Station, 3320 Idaho Avenue, N.W. and the Third District Station, 1620V Street, N.W. The fire services are organized into two components-engine companies that include the basic fire-fighting apparatus,such as hoses, water connections and pumping equipment, and truck companies that provide ladder trucks and related equipment. In addition to land based fire- fighting responsibilities, the D.C.Fire Department is responsible for fire boat operations. In Ward 2 there are nine engine companies two fire boats and five ambulances f) The District of Columbia is served by two major recreation systems. One is administered by the District’s Department of Recreation (DOR) and the other!by the National Park Service (NPS The District’s Department of Recreation operates recreational programs at 18 locations on more than 93 acres. Recreational facilities include eight swimming pools, 25 tennis courts and an extensive scenic bike route. The National Park Service maintains 1,188 acges that include the Mall, East Potomac Park, West Potomac Park, the Lady Bird Johnson Park, a small portion of Rock Creek Park and numerous small parks. Ward 2 has a total of 1,281 acres of park land g) The Pennsylvania Avenue Development Corporation has created new open spaces along the avenuelbetween the Capitol and the White House including Pershing Park, Western Plaza, John Marshall Park, Navy Memorial Park and Indiana Park h) Several other public facilities are operated by the D.C. Department of Human Services. These neighborhood centers offer general health care, maternal, mental health and other community services i) The District government departments that are primarily responsible for carrying out the policies related to public facilities are the Departments of Housing and Community Development, Public Works, Administrative Services, and the Office of the Deputy Mayor!for Finance, the Office of Business and Economic Development and the Office of Planning j) The public facilities goal of the~District is to provide adequate public facilities, support the cost-effective delivery of municipal programs and services, and support economic development and neighborhood improvement objectives. 106 k) The major tool for implementing the policies in the Public Facilities Element is the Capital Improvements Program (CIP Under Mayor’s Order 84-87, a Capital Program Coordinating Office was created in the Office of the Budget to prepare the Capital Budget and the Capital Improvement Plan. The Office of Planning is currently responsible for reviewing all projects recommended for inclusion in the CIP for consistency with the Comprehensive Plan i) In general, the public facility recommendations support the upgrading of certain facilities, provide for, along with other improvements, the accessibility of the handicapped, as well as better maintenance of parks, playgrounds, and recreation centers SEC. 1200.214. WARD 2 OBJECTIVES FOR PUBLIC FACILITIES The public facilities objectives are as follows I) Ensure the construction, rehabilitation and maintenance of facilities essential for public service delivery to the ward’s current and future population 2) Provide for coordinated planning of public facilities construction and/or rehabilitation SEC. 1200.215. WARD 2 ACTIONS OBJECTIVES IN SUPPORT OF PUBLIC FACILITIES The actions in support of public facilities objectives are as follows I) Monitor the reuse of surplus public properties to ensure reuses that are compatible with the existing character of the surrounding neighborhood 2) Work with private service organizations to ensure that their locations and operations do not create negative impacts in the ward 3) Fire, housing and building code problems need to be more adequately addressed in Ward 2 public housing units. DCRA, the Fire Department and DHCD shall identify code problems in public housing units and program improvements 4) DCRA, the Department of Human Services (DHS) and the Community Based Residential Facilities Office, working with the Board of Zoning Adjustment, shall ensure that CBRF’s are appropriately located throughout Ward 2, except that no action to ensure the appropriate location shall violate the Fair Housing Amendments Act, approved March 12, 1989 (102 Stat. 1619; 42 U.S.C. 3601 et seq Fair Housing Act For the purposes of this paragraph, the term ’handicap’ has the same meaning as in section 802(h) of the Fair Housing Act (42 U.S.C. 3602(h The Department of Consumer and Regulatory Affairs (DCRA) shall increase its enforcement of zoning regulations related to 107 CBRF’s as part of a formal equitable distribution program involving all wards of the city 5) Increase the supply of recreational facilities in some of the more densely populated neighborhoods (the northern and Western sections of Ward 2 Access to recreational facilities is inadequate and costly for residents, particularly for the elderly, disabled, handicapped and young children A) Continue efforts to develop a variety of recreational opportunities for residents of the ward B) The Department of Recreation shall increase efforts to meet the needs of special population groups, including programs for juveniles and the mentally and physically disabled andother persons who have been deprived of adequaterecreational resources C) The Department of Recreation and the National Park Service NPS should continue to work together to foster use of federal park and recreational facilities in Ward 2 SEC. 1200.216. WARD 2 URBAN DESIGN a) Ward 2 neighborhoods exhibit a variety of urban design characteristics. For instance, Georgetown has a very special character generally established by small-scale buildings along tree lined streets, encircled by a ring of parks. The Georgetown Waterfront, however, is an area that has undergone a significant change of character over the past I0 years b) Georgetown University, on a hill and largely removed from the activity of the city, has a number of Gothic buildings that establish an image of tradition. George Washington University, in Foggy Bottom at the edge of the Central Business District, is a much more urban campus. Fort NcNair, site of the Army War College, is a cross between a campus and a military enclave c) The Southwest area has a different physical character than other sections of Ward 2, having been almost completely rebuild under the urban renewal program of the late 1950s and 1960s. In fact, urban renewal has had a significant effect on much of Ward 2 d) Some areas, such as part of the North Capitol Street area and the South Capitol Street/Buzzard Point area, lack a strong design character, although development in the future will provide an opportunity to change this situation. The design of urban development is typically influenced by both formal and informal urban design processes. The most important formal design determinant in Washington, D.C and Ward 2) has been the Height Act of 1910, creating a strongly horizontal city. 108 e) Some parts of the ward receive detailed design review. The U.S. Commission of Fine Arts and the National Capital Planning Commission have long placed special emphasis on the design and development of the Monumental Core. The Architect of the Capitol has given special attention to the design of the Capitol area. Some other areas of Ward 2, adjacent to federal buildings and grounds, receive design review from the Commission of Fine Arts under the provisions of the federal Shipstead-Luce Act. The Pennsylvania Avenue Development Corporation (PADC) administers a design and review process for the Pennsylvania Avenue Development Area. The 18 historic districts in the ward receive design review through the D.C. Historic Preservation Review Board. Development of urban renewal disposition sites receives design review from the Redevelopment Land Agency (RLA) Design Panel. WMATA also influences design on its parcels adjacent to station entrances and, of course, the Metrorail system itself influences many design decisions. However, while there is considerable design review activity in Ward 2, this review is somewhat disjointed. Some areas of the ward receive major design attention ile other areas receive almost none. Furthermore, there is no formal design plan for the entire ward, nor does there appear to be any sort of shared vision of how Ward 2 should look and function f) Urban design can also take place through informal means, through cooperative private efforts or when there is a consensus on desirable design character. The level of architectural design for individual buildings has generally improved lately as developers and their architects seem to be more concerned about the context of their buildings g) Much of Ward 2 has been redeveloped in recent years. Some sections of the ward are designated for preservation and design change in these areas will be limited. In other areas, there are opportunities to create a new design character. These opportunities exist now in the Downtown and to a lesser extent in the West End. They will exist in the future in Mount Vernon Square North, North Capitol Street, the South Capitol Street/Buzzard Point area, and the Southeast Federal Center/Navy Yard area. The areas around three of the Metrorail stations under construction offer special design and development opportunities Mount Vernon Square/UDC, Shaw and Navy Yard h) The overall urban design goal is to promote the protection, enhancement, and enjoyment of the natural environs and to promote an environment that provides visual orientation, enhances the District’s aesthetic qualities, emphasizes neighborhood identities, and is functionally efficient. 109 i) Special emphasis has been placed on the urban design of Downtown. Objectives and policies dealing with the urban design of Downtown are included in the adopted Downtown Plan Element of the Comprehensive Plan SEC. 1200.217. WARD 2 OBJECTIVE FOR URBAN DESIGN The objective for urban design is to develop a quality urban design environment, combining old and new developments, taking maximum advantage of special design Opportunity Areas SEC. 1200.218. WARD 2 ACTIONS IN SUPPORT OF URBAN DESIGN OBJECTIVES The actions in support of the urgban design objective is as follows I) Enhance the special design character and improve street design standards of the street system in Ward 2 A) Establish a committee to develop a uniform municipal sign system to review prototypes for automobile and pedestrian directional signs to major public and private attractions B) Consider allowing only open-air cafes in public spaces to prevent the disruption of the visual continuity of these areas C) Enforce the present law on the size of public passageways and increase the minimum size of public passageways in crowded areas D) Revise the vending regulations to reduce concentrations of sidewalk vendors and to improve the appearance and public safety considerations of sidewalk vendors 2) Enhance the overall design character of Ward 2, and the special character of the different areas and neighborhoods of Ward 2, including those undergoing major redevelopment A) The Office of Planning (OP) shall prepare urban design guidelines for areas within Ward 2 as part of its small area plans B) The city shall include urban design guidelines as part of the planning program for Development Opportunity Areas Downtown and West End) and for areas that will undergo major development in the future (Mount Vernon Square North, North Capitol Street, and South Capitol Street/Buzzard Point C) The city, in conjunction with community groups, shall place special emphasis on maintaining and enhancing the distinguishable physical qualities including open spaces and landscape features of Foggy Bottom, Georgetown, Dupont Circle, Shaw, Stanton Park and Southwest. 110 ~n~ed Orlgina D) The city shall find ways to protect and enhance the special character of neighborhood commercial centers, such as Seventh Street, N.W 14th Street, N.W H Street, N.E and M Street in Georgetown E) Uniform streetscape and building design guidelines including signage standards shall be created and approved by the main "design impact group The guidelines shall become part of the small area plans and the guidelines should not serve to overly restrict architectural creativity in design F) The Seventeenth Street Design Plan shall be implemented. The Plan calls for streetscape improvements to all publically owned land immediately in front of the private property line, all sidewalk areas, all parkways, all curbs, and all right-of-ways on both sides of the street from 1711 17th Street, N.W. on the north, to 1500 17th Street, N.W. on the south, and the adjoining, contiguous commercial areas of R, Corcoran, Q, Church, and P Streets, N.W 3) Place special emphasis on the design of areas around Metrorail stations where new development is likely to occur A) Ensure that detailed development and urban design plans are created for Metrorail station areas within the ward where new development is likely to occur B) Ensure that development around and adjacent to the stations provides pedestrian amenities, ease of access, lighting, security and signage befitting a portal to the city. In addition, adequate buffering and integration of new development into the surrounding neighborhood should be encouraged 4) Emphasize superior design of new development and open space along Ward 2 waterfront areas A) The city, working with the National Park Service, shall ensure that Ward 2 waterfront areas, including Georgetown, Maine Avenue, Buzzard Point and along the Anacostia, provide public access and use B) Economic development incentives shall be used by the city to promote quality developments along waterfronts, with open space, parks for recreation and cultural programs, and street-level retail activity during the day and night C) Complete the park on District-owned Georgetown waterfront land south of K Street, with particular attention being given to lighting and security issues 5) Strategies are required that will address the treatment of vacant buildings and vacant land. DCRA shall enforce the requirement that owners of property with vacant structures that remain vacant for more than 60 days 111 shall secure them against unauthorized entry, including through windows, doors and public space, by the use of security bars, cinder blocks or security fencing as appropriate. The city shall place a lien on,the property if the owner does not bring the property into compliance after the specified time period. DCRA should develop programs that would encourage the owners of vacant building, particularly residential buildings, to sell or renovate SEC. 1200.219. WARD 2 PRESERVATION AND HISTORIC FEATURES a) Ward 2 is the oldest area of the city in terms of the physical development of the District of Columbia. The earliest commercial development, the first buildings of the federal government, and the earliest residential neighborhoods are all located in Ward 2. The legacy of the L’Enfant Street plan provides a fabric of special streets, squares, circles and other open spaces. Ward 2 is therefore especially rich in landmark buildings and historic areas, which help give it a uniq~le physical character. Historic Districts comprise a considerable portion ofithe land area of Ward 2. Ward 2 has the largest number of~individual landmark buildings of any ward in the city, and has 18 historic districts b) The Historic Districts listed on the National Register of Historic Places are (both individual sites and areas are included I) Dupont Circle 2) Foggy Bottom 3) Georgetown 4) Lafayette Square 5) Logan Circle 6) Massachusetts Avenue 7) Pennsylvania Avenue; and 8) 16th Street c) The Historic District nominated to the National Register are I) Downtown; and 2) 15th Street Financial d) Federally-owned Historic Districts listed on the National Register are I) C&amp;amp;O Canal 2) East and West Potomac Parks 3) Ford’s Theater 4) National Mall 5) President’s Park South 6) Washington Monument and Grounds 7) Washington Navy Yard; and ¯ 8) Analoston Island (Roosevelt Island e) The scale and character of these Districts vary considerably. Thus, it is important that preservation 112 activity take into consideration the unique characteristics of each District f) Despite this major historic preservation presence, there is still concern about the protection and enhancement of historic resources in Ward 2. This concern focuses on the preservation of landmark buildings, the historic character of certain streets and areas and the preservation of the fabric, small scale and remaining open space in historic districts g) Existing programs for historic preservation are carried out by the District government, the federal government, and private organizations. The Historic preservation Office of the Department of Consumer and Regulatory Affairs, which provides technical staff support to the D.C. Historic preservation Review Board, is responsible for administering the District’s program, and functions within the regulatory framework of D.C. Law 2-14 Historic Landmark and Historic District Protection Act of 1978. The Mayor’s agent for D.C. Law 2-I~ has the authority to determine demolition of landmarks or buildings in historic districts for "projects of special merit" or "projects in accordance with the Act The Historic Preservation Office provides some technical and financial assistance. The Historic preservation Office is undertaking surveys and special studies to identify historic buildings and areas, and determine ways to retain and use these resources h) A wide variety of other District programs contribute to historic preservation, including housing programs and capital improvements. The city and its agencies (including the Zoning Commission) will place special emphasis on preserving historic district’s and the buildings in them. Because of the historic federal buildings and lands in Ward 2, the federal government has a major role in protecting and enhancing the historic environment of Ward 2 i) Many citizen and neighborhood groups also play a vital role in preservation activities in Ward 2. The D.C. Preservation League, the city’s umbrella preservation organization, has been especially concerned with preservation activities in Ward 2, especially the Downtown Ward 2. The Georgetown Citizens Association, the Foggy Bottom Association, and the Dupont Circle Conservancy have strong preservation programs j) Ward 2 has been the focus of a number of preservation struggles and many preservation victories. The preservation and reuse of the Old Post Office and the Willard Hotel are two special examples k) In terms of landmark buildings and historic districts, the preservation framework is generally 113 ~nr011ed established in most of Ward 2. The major exceptions are the Shaw Area, the Mount Vernon Square North Area, where additional designation of landmarks and establishment of districts may be warranted I) The issue of preserving historic streets and open spaces is somewhat more complex. The street and open space pattern in most of Ward 2 is a reflection of the L’Enfant Plan, as modified over time. The avenues, streets and related squares, circles, parks and open spaces of Ward 2 provide a special character and help establish a special image for Washington as a city and as the nation’s capital m) The design and maintenance of these streets and squares raises issues of historic character, which are related to urban design issues. The historic character of streets and spaces is influenced by the actual physical design and by activities. Obstruction of views, movement along Special Streets, and insensitive design of sidewalk cafes in historic districts, especially those attached to landmark buildings, can detract from the character of the historic district or landmark. Georgetown has its own unique street pattern with special characteristics. This pattern is not as formal as in other areas of the ward that were parts of the L’Enfant Plan. In the case of Foggy Bottom, its historic district is enhanced by Washington’s remaining 19th century alley dwellings which are virtually unique to the city n) The issue of a landmark street surfaced in the case of the Eighth Street Vista through the Techworld project. The issue of historic streets and places usually involves not only historic preservation questions, but also broader questions of urban design o) Preservation provides one alternative view of the future, which stresses certain historical and environmental values over the "tear it down and start all over" approach. A variety of forces will shape the preservation environment over the next five to 10 years. The concept of historic preservation has achieved growing community support that seems likely to increase in future years. An improved climate for investment in central Washington has made developers willing to invest in renovation in many areas of Ward 2. This trend also is likely to continue, especially in the Shaw Area. Rising land values also bring new development and preservation conflicts SEC. 1200.220. WARD 2 OBJECTIVES IN SUPPORT OF HISTORIC PRESERVATION AND HISTORIC FEATURES The objectives in support of historic preservation and historic features are as follows I) To designate buildings and areas in Ward 2 meriting historic landmark or historic district protection. 11 2) To preserve and reuse historic landmarks and buildings in historic areas in Ward 2 3) To preserve the design quality of historic and special streets and places in Ward 2 4) To preserve and protect existing buildings, small scale and open spaces in historic areas in Ward 2 SEC. 1200.221. WARD 2 ACTIONS IN SUPPORT OF HISTORIC PRESERVATION AND HISTORIC FEATURES The actions in support of historic preservation and historic features are as follows I) Undertake surveys in Shaw and Mount Vernon Square to determine what additional buildings and sites should be designated as historic landmarks and what additional areas should be designated as historic districts 2) Complete process of designating additional landmarks and historic districts in Ward 2 3) Undertake studies of special streets and places in Ward 2, with emphasis on the major avenues, circles, and squares of the L’Enfant Plan, as well as community streets with special character 4) DPW and the Public Space Committee shall pay particular attention to the approval, design and character of sidewalk cafes located in historic districts or attached to historic landmark buildings 5) DCRA shall increase awareness of and access to facilities, places and activities in order that residents and visitors gain a fuller understanding of their culture and history. DCRA should focus special attention on the numerous historical and cultural facilities within Ward 2 to inform the general public of their existence and availability 6) Current residents are concerned that new historic district designations may result in displacement and neighborhood change (In Ward 2 the greatest concern is in Shaw DCRA and DHCD should implement programs to assist the preservation of buildings for low- and moderate-income residents as required 7) Excessive sidewalk vending activities detract from the character of historic districts and landmarks buildings 8) To ensure uniform design and preservation standards throughout the 18 historic districts in the Ward, the D.C. Historic Preservation Review Board shall, upon request of the affected ANC, review all permit applications relating to new construction, alterations, and/or demolition in such historic district without exception. Such review shall occur on the record at a public hearing in full conformity with the provisions of D.C. Law 2-144 and shall 115 En~olled Orlg~nal provide affected ANCs full participation in conformity with the ANC Act, irrespective of any other design review 9) To ensure consistent design and preservation standards throughout the 18 historical districts in the ward, the Mayor’s agent shall issue written decisions in all protested cases in full accordance with D.C. Law 2-144 and the ANC Act I0) The Office of Planning shall develop regulations which will prohibit a developer of a "Large Tract greater than 50,000 sq. ft. or 3 acres) from evading "Large Tract Review" by dividing the project into "stages" or "phases" which individually are less than the threshold size, but which, when aggregated, exceed it Ii) The Office of Planning, upon request of the affected ANC, shall apply its Large Tract Review procedures to developments proposed along or within major commercial corridors 12) Open space traditionally associated with public and privately owned historic properties, such as yards, gardens, and large estate grounds, shall be retained whenever possible to protect the integrity of the property and its sense of setting 13) Address the problem of "demolition by neglect" of buildings in historic districts demolition by neglect" refers to buildings that are permitted to deteriorate irretrievably SEC. 1200.222. WARD 2 HUMAN SERVICES a) The availability and efficient distribution of needed human services are especially critical in Ward 2. This stems primarily from the fact that Ward 2 has the most diverse mix of housing, shopping, and employment in the city. The metropolitan region’s primary retail and office center, the core of the federal government, and neighborhoods as old as the city itself are in Ward 2. The result is a wide and varying need for human services within the ward b) Human services delivery systems must be able to meet the needs of the daily influx into the city’s Central Employment Area as well as the needs of the Ward’s resident population. With a total of 6,936 units of public housing, Ward 2 has the largest concentration of public housing in the District. Social problems, including drug abuse, crime, and prostitution are prevalent in the Eighth and H Street, 14th and R and P Street areas, as well as other areas in Ward 2. Ward 2 has a median family income that is I0 percent lower than the city’s median; 20~ of the ward’s families are in poverty as compared with 16~ for the city. Ward 2 have an above average percentage of dependent 116 Enrolled Orlsi~ population and, as a result, a greater need for human services c) The District’s Department of Human Services DHS is the District’s primary human services agency and carries the responsibility for implementing the Human Services Element of the Comprehensive Plan. In conjunction with other District agencies and private organizations, DHS’s mission includes: providing social, economic, and health support for those people who cannot otherwise secure it; ensuring that citizens with temporary needs have access to programs that help them gain and maintain~independence; and contributing to the improvement of the health, well-being and quality of life for residents and visitors to the District of Columbia. To facilitate the~provision of services, DHS has six clinics and four service centers in Ward 2 SEC. 1200.223. WARD 2 OBJECTIVES FOR HUMAN SERVICES The objectives for human services are as follows I) To offer a comprehensive range of community based social services for those in need 2) To promote health, environmental and life-style conditions to strengthen the well~being of the ward’s children and youth 3) To promote conditions to enable persons with disabilities to participate as fully as possible in the life of the ward 4) To assist mentally disabled ~ersons to live and obtain services 5) To promote programs of needed health, social services and support levels for older adults!to enable them to maintain themselves with a sense of security, dignity, self-respect and independence SEC. 1200.224. WARD 2 ACTIONS IN SUPPORT OE HUMAN SERVICES The actions in support of human services objectives are as follows i) Develop ways to deliver health and social services that are indispensable to those in ~eed throughout the ward. Particular attention should be focused on the homeless, households headed by women and the!elderly. DHS should provide for the transportation of low, income families and teenagers to various educational programs, as required 2) Maintain concentrated crime-reduction programs throughout the ward. The Metropolitan Police Department MPD should enforce the laws against prostitution and other illicit activities and ensure that hotels, inns, and other transient occupancies do not become centers of illegal activity. MPD should increase police 117 presence throughout the ward particularly in the areas in which illicit activities are currently concentrated, and expand ward police and community relations especially focused on community cooperation efforts on crime prevention 3) Distribute public information and fact sheets on public safety services to local businesses, residents and tourists. The District should!support public education programs in churches, schools and related centers to deal with drug abuse, crime and prostitution. The District should establish better communication between the public and private sectors to publicize the availability of various educational programs in churches, schools and related centers in the ward and other areas in the District and surrounding communities 4) Expand programs to serve the!unprecedented number of homeless persons A) Expand cooperation with, and seek the support of, the large network of private and~voluntary agencies engaged in human service activitieslso that adequate social services will be provided toithe homeless. Increase the number of programs which provide child care services for the children of homeless families These programs should provide the children with early childhood development opportunities, and allow the parents the freedom to get job training and seek permanent housing B) Monitor programs developed to aid the homeless in the city to ensure the highest quality of care and services possible with the limited resources available C) Increase programs for training and employment of the homeless D) Urge the Mayor’s Committee on Persons with Disabilities and the Department of Human Services to develop additional support systems to assist persons who have been "deinstitutionalized 5) Develop strategies that will address the needs of older citizens to allow them to continue contributing to society and lead useful lives A) Encourage the Office oniAging to expand existing programs or develop new programs soithat the elderly can continue to make a contribution to their communities B) Increase dissemination of information in the community regarding health and social~services offered by the District for the elderly SEC. 1200.225. WARD 2 LAND USE a) Within Ward 2 there are wide variations in the scale, density and patterns of development. One way to 118 conceptualize Ward 2 is to think of it as a series of concentric rings b) In the center of Ward 2 is the Monumental Core, an area of formal parklands and key national buildings and monuments, including the Capitol, the White House, the Washington Monument, and the Lincoln and Jefferson Memorials. Subareas of the Monumental Core include the U.S. Capitol, the Mall, West Potomac Park, the Federal Triangle, The Northwest Rectangle and extending south, East Potomac Park. Roosevelt and Columbia Islands in the Potomac River are both entirely federally-owned park land c) The Architect of the Capitol is responsible for planning the development of the Capitol Complex. The remaining area of the Monumental Core is the responsibility of various federal agencies, especially the National Park Service, the General Services Administration and the Smithsonian Institution, all operating within the overall planning framework established by the National Capital Planning Commission NCPC This area of parkland and monumental public buildings comprises much of the national and international image of Washington, and is a major attraction for the 18 million visitors to Washington each year d) The second ring is the Central Employment Area, which surrounds and includes the Monumental Core. This is the major retail, office, and hotel area of the city. This large Central Employment Area includes the commercial areas of Downtown, the Connecticut Avenue and K Street area, the George Washington University area, and the Southwest Employment Area e) Around the Central Employment Area on the north and south is a third ring of distinctive areas, primarily residential neighborhoods, but including some commercial areas. The include Georgetown, Foggy Bottom, West End, Dupont Circle, Logan Circle, Shaw, Northwest Number One Urban Renewal Area, a portion of the H Street, N.E. area, the Southwest residential areas, Fort McNair, Capitol South/Buzzard Point, and the Southwest Federal Center/Navy Yard f) A wide range of planning programs and land use and design controls guide development in Ward 2. Federal master planning covers the Monumental Core and other major federal areas, including Fort McNair and the Southwest Federal Center/Navy Yard. The Architect of the Capitol has prepared a master plan for the U.S. Capitol Complex. The Pennsylvania Avenue Development Corporation, a federal development agency, guides the development of federal and private land alongthe north side of Pennsylvania Avenue between the White House and the Capitol. Non-public land is 119 ¯ ur ~IXe~Orlgi~X is controlled by zoning, except in the Southwest Urban Renewal Area, where urban renewal plan controls areused g) The ward includes all or part of six urban renewal areas: Southwest, Downtown, Shaw School, Northwest Number One, Northeast Number One and H Street. Ward 2 also has more landmark buildings than any other w~rd in the city, and includes 18 historic districts. George ~ashington University and Georgetown University have approved campus plans h) The land use patterns in Ward 2 include a diversity of uses at a wide range of densities. Some areas are essentially fully developed and will be subject to relatively little change. In other areas, change will be dramatic. The following sections describe key areas in summary terms, including the current situation, how conditions will change over time, and major development pressures, trends and opportunities CENTRAL EMPLOYMENT AREA Monumental Core a) Planning for the Monumental Core is the responsibility of the federal government. The development of this area of parks, monuments, museums and government buildings is relatively complete. However, there are some opportunities for additional development. These include the Holocaust Museum, the National Sculpture Garden and the International Cultural and trade Center (to be located in the Federal Triangle The Judiciary Office’Building on Columbus Plaza will be built adjacent to Union Station under the direction of the Architect of the Capitol. The Master Plan for the Capitol outlines sites for additional congressional buildings, if needed, in the future b) The challenge to the District government is to plan and promote linkages between the Monumental Core and adjacent areas. For economic reasons, the District is anxious to attract visitors from the Monumental Core into adjacent areas, especially Downtown Downtown a) The Downtown area between the Capitol and the ~ite House, north of Pennsylvania Avenue, is now the major area of development in the city. This is expected to continue over the next I0 to 15 years. A new development pattern has been established on the western edge of Downtown. Land use objectives and policies have been outlined and adopted as part of the Downtown~Element of the Comprehensive Plan. Progress in achieving office and hotel land use targets has been excellent, and goo~ progress is being made in achieving retail development. Progress on arts and residential development has been more limited, though important initial development programming is underway 120 ~n~olle~ Ori~ine b) The public-private Downtown partnership, an organization established to help achieve a "Living Downtown is a combined effort of the District government and private sector Special efforts are being focused on the Retail Core, the Seventh Street Arts Area, and Chinatown Connecticut Avenue and K Street The development pattern in the Connecticut Avenue and K Street area, which was the major development area in the city from 1960 to the early 1980’s, is now established and there will be little change over the next five to fifteen years. There will be infill development on a few remaining sites, such as office construction on the Raleigh’s site (Connecticut Avenue and DeSales Street) and at 18th and L Streets. Opportunities for development incldde some additional office space, increased retail space and streetscape improvements George Washington University Development of George Washington University will continue in accordance with the campus plan. Continuing pressure from the university, resulting from!the destruction of housing, the extensive construction of buildings leased for commercial use, and the complete lack of~construct~on of dormitories is of grave concern to the Foggy[Bottom residential community. Intense student pressure on Foggy Bottom’s housing stock outside the campus, combined with the impact of university generated traffic has had an extremely disruptive effect on residential Foggy Bottom. Additional measures will be needed, including dormitory~construction and the conversion of buildings leased for commercial use for dormitory use, if an acceptable urban campus environment of GWU is to be achieved Southwest Employment Area a) The development pattern in the Southwest Employment Area, north of the Southwest Freeway, is well established. The Aeronautics and Space Administration Building and the building for the U.S. International Trade Commission have been recently completed. The Portal site is the largest remaining vacant parcel and will be developed over the next I0 years. The Portal site will include office, retail and hotel uses b) Opportunities for improved connections with the waterfront from the Portal site and the L’Enfant Esplanade (10th Street Mall) need to be addressed. East of Fourth Street, S.W. there are opportunities for inc@eased development on the Southwest Market side, north of the freeway THE NEIGHBORHOOD RING Georgetown. 121 F~nr~lle~ Origins a) This neighborhood includes the Georgetown waterfront area, the area south of M Street, the M Street and Wisconsin Avenue commercial strips, the small-scale residential areas east and west of Wisconsin Avenue, and Georgetown University. Georgetown is unique in Ward 2 in being almost completely encircled by parks and open space. Major mixed-use development has occurred south of M Street in the past 15 years. Completion of the long-promised waterfront park, now in the first stage, and retention of the remaining open space along the Georgetown waterfront will add a new amenity for Georgetown and the city b) Renovation and new fill-in construction has occurred over the past decade along the M Street and Wisconsin Avenue commercial strips. New retail and eating establishments have made Georgetown one of the most active and interesting commercial areas in the city. However, there is growing concern about the impact of development and the crowds on the ambience of commercial and residential Georgetown. Public safety is an increasing concern among Georgetown residents and business people. Special efforts will still be necessary to limit the impact of the development and the crowds on adjacent areas Foggy Bottom/West End a) Foggy Bottom has two types of development. High-rise buildings extend along most of K Street, while Virginia Avenue and New Hampshire Avenue are a mixture of high rise buildings and small scale townhouses. Columbia Plaza and Watergate, both major mixed-use complexes, are south of Virginia Avenue. In the center of the neighborhood is an area of small-scale townhouses, most of which have been renovated beginning in the 1950s. The recently designated Foggy Bottom Historical District will provide protection for this area. The development pattern in Foggy Bottom is established b) The West End, just north of Foggy Bottom, is a former industrial and residential area that has been undergoing major change over the past I0 years. The area was rezoned in 1975 to encourage mixed-use developmentJ Since that time there has been major development of office, hotel and a few apartment buildings. Remaining underdeveloped sites in the West End are expected to be filled in over the next I0 years. The opportunity remains to enhance the M Street corridor, connecting the Connecticut Avenue area and Georgetown through the West End Dupont Circle. The general pattern of development in Dupont Circle is established. Commercial and residential renovation and in-fill development will continue, guided by the constraints of the Dupont Circle Historic District. The area is becoming increasingly attractive for in-town living as a 122 ~n~olle~ Orlgi~ result of the growth of Connecticut Avenue and Downtown as employment centers, and by commercial revitalization along Connecticut Avenue, 17th Street, and U Street to the north. The major pressure is the continuing erosion of residential use by office use and the displacement of local services by retail uses that attract a broader market. Restaurant and entertainment uses in the Connecticut Avenue areas are having an increasing impact on residential areas in terms of evening parking. The opportunity remains to retain and improve this unique in-town neighborhood Logan Circle/Shaw a) The large area, extending from 15th Street to New Jersey Avenue, includes a wide range of residential development, from large Historical mansions and townhouses around Logan Circle to small row houses west of Seventh Street. High-rise apartment buildings are located in the southwest corner of the area near Downtown, and in several locations along Seventh Street and 14th Street. Low-rise and garden apartment buildings also have been built on urban renewal sites east of Seventh Street. The area also includes the Shaw Junior High School complex on Rhode Island Avenue, as well as numerous other public buildings and churches b) Major renovation of residential buildings in the Logan Circle area has been underway for some time, with renovation activity generally moving eastward. There is also a cluster of renovation activity along M Street east of Seventh Street. Residential and commercial renovation and new construction are expected to continue over the next I0 years c) The Logan Circle/Shaw Area benefits from renovation activity moving east from Dupont Circle, the growing employment base in Downtown, and the renovation and new construction in the U Street corridor to the north. The opening of the Metrorail Green Line along Seventh Street in late 1990 will provide three new Metrorail stations in or adjacent to the area (Mount Vernon Square/UDC, Shaw, and U Street stations The Shaw Metrorail Station, now under construction, will have an entrance at Seventh and S Streets, N.W. The promise of the station and the availability of attractive rowhouses are drawing new residents to the Shaw neighborhood. As renovation moves eastward, it is producing some displacement problems d) Renovation and new construction are already beginning in the 14th Street corridor from Thomas Circle to U Street, though there are still problems with prostitution, drugs and other criminal activity. There is an opportunity for major residential and commercial development in the corridor; however, existing low- and moderate-income residents and small businesses may be threatened. 123 Enrolle~ Original Coordinated efforts are necessary to spur improvement while retaining housing and small businesses e) The Office of Planning, along with area business persons, residents and other agencies, is inVolved in preparing a small area study of 14th Street between Thomas Circle and Florida Avenue. The aim of the study is to encourage the creation of a multi-use, multi-neighborhood retail strip along 14th Street. Restaurants, offices, arts spaces and theaters are among the use that could thrive in a redefined 14th Street corridor Mount Vernon Square North a) Mount Vernon Square North is a triangular area bounded by Massachusetts Avenue, M Street and Third Street, N.W It is located north of Downtown and south of the Logan Circle/Shaw area. It is one of the major Development Opportunity Areas in Ward 2. The pattern in,the western edge of the area is established with a number of existing apartment buildings along Massachusetts AvenUe. The northwest corner of the area is also established with the recently completed Paradise Gardens housing development and row house renovation, centered on M Street b~tween Seventh and Fourth Streets. Much of the rest of thelremaining area is subject to change, being either vacant or~under-utilized land. The Comprehensive Plan indicates mixed-use and high-density residential development. The Mount Vernon Square Area is designated as a Housing Opportunity Area b) The District government controls two key properties, the Mount Vernon Square/UDC campus site (four squares) and the remainder of the "Wax Museum" site (Urban Renewal Parcel I It is anticipated that m~ch of the Mount Vernon Square North area will be rebuilt over the next I0 to 15 years. This will create an attractive mixed-use neighborhood north of Downtown North Capitol Street a) This area is divided into two main sections. The area west of North Capitol Street (Northwest One Urban Renewal Area) is generally built up. It includes high-rise Sursum Corda apartments and the Gonzaga High School complex. Only limited in-fill development possibilities remain. The southern part of Northwest One is occupied by the Government Printing Office (GPO which is to expand soUth to Massachusetts Avenue. Establishing an appropriate relationship of the new GPO development to Massachusetts Avenue is an especially important issue b) Major development is expected to take place in the area east of North Capitol Street and north of Massachusetts Avenue to New York Avenue. This area is part of the Northeast One/Eckington Yards special Treatment Area, which extends into Ward 5 to include the Eckington Yards north of New York Avenue. 124 ~rolle~-O~i~ine c) Major development is already underway or planned in the southern part of this area around Union Station. At present, ten development projects are underway or proposed in the area south of K Street. The largest are the renovation of Union Station (to accommodate a retail mall, office space, and a renovated railroad station the proposed reuse of the former Main Post Office for office, retail and museum use, and the proposed new building for the Administrative Office of the U.S. Courts to be built east of Union Station. The potential exists to develop a group of buildings in this area with over 2.7 million square feet of space d) The area north of K Street, N.E. consists of old warehouses, vacant land, and abandoned office buildings. This is a prime location for a major mixed-use complex at a key gateway to Downtown, where New York Avenue enters the Central part of the city H Street, N.E. The western portion of the H Street commercial strip (from the railroad tracks to Ninth Street, N.E and the residential area north to Florida Avenue, is part of Ward 2. After years of effort, commercial revitalization is finally taking hold along the H Street corridor. Housing renovation is also increasing in the residential area to the north. The revitalization of this area will involve rebuilding H Street, increasing the variety of retail services, and improving the residential area to the north Southwest a) Southwest was completely rebuilt in the 1960s during the country’s first Urban Renewal Program. The area is primarily residential, but includes restaurants and commercial buildings along Maine Avenue, the Arena Stage and Waterside Mall, plus a variety of public facilities near South Capitol Street. Fort McNair is located south of P Street. Southwest is adjacent to the Central Employment Area. Accessibility will be improved when the Green Line Waterfront Metrorail Station opens in late 1991 b) Twenty years after the start of the nation’s first urban renewal project, Southwest provides a mature and pleasant environment. Appropriate steps are needed to protect the character of the area, including resolving the issue of zoning when the Urban Renewal Plan controls expire in the 1990s. Major new development is not anticipated but attention needs to be directed to key problems in the area, including improving retail services at Waterside Mall, improving the attractiveness and amenities along the Maine Avenue waterfront, and improving housing maintenance in the Greenleaf Gardens and James Creek public housing projects South Capitol/Buzzard Point. 125 a) The most significant development change in Ward 2 will come in the South Capitol Street/Buzzard Point area, and the adjacent Southeast Federal Center/Navy Yard complexes. The area now includes industrialiuses, vacant land, and new office buildings. Full redevelopment of the area will take I0 to 15 years. The Comprehensive Plan calls for high density mixed commercial and residential development. A redevelopment proposal has been prepared by a group of property owners, which calls for a mix of office, retail and residential uses b) Access to the area will be improved when the Navy Yard Metrorail Station opens in 1991. The station entrances will be located at New Jersey Avenue and M Street, S.E. Development of the Anacostia River waterfront from Fort McNair to the Navy Yard presents an opportunity for the Buzzard Point area and the city c) The Arthur Capper housing project~occupies the triangular area east of Buzzard Point bordered by Second Street, S.E the Southeast Freeway, and M Street, S.E. Continued housing maintenance efforts are necessary here Southeast Federal Center/Navy Yard a) This 605-acre site is federally owned. The western portion consists of cleared land and~abandoned industrial buildings. The Navy Yard itself consists of a variety of buildings dating from the early 19th century through the World Ward II period b) The preliminary plan for the Southeast Federal Center calls for office space for up to 30,000 federal employees as well as retail shops, a new urban square, and extension of New Jersey Avenue to the Anacostia River, and a riverfront park c) This increase of federal employment in the area will support an expanded market for nearby residential development. The waterfront development, and the Navy Museum, will draw more residents and visitors to the area. The Navy Yard Metrorail Station, scheduled to open in last 1991, will make this area readily accessible to the Central Employment Area Major Land Use Themes for Ward 2 The development pattern of Ward 2 is varied and complex. A review of the different areas of~the ward indicates Ii broad land-use themes or issues~that need special attention. The themes or issues arenas follows I) Maintain Existing Residential Neighborhoods A) The major residential n~ighborhoods of Ward 2 (Georgetown, Foggy Bottom, Dupont Clrcle, Logan Circle, Mount Vernon Square North, Shaw, Sursum Corda, Stanton Park North, Southwest and Near South4ast) are arranged like parts of a pinwheel around theiCentral Employment Area. A residential neighborhood~is proposed in 126 Downtown. At present, the Downtown residential community is small, fragmented and a reminder of the past rather than a hope for the future unless the government intervenes B) The overriding issues f~r Ward 2 neighborhoods are the threat of commercial encroachment (including hotels the impact from uses such as community based residential facilities and chanceries and numerous parking and traffic problems C) Commercial development in Dupont Circle has had a major impact on adjacent area residents where loss of the housing stock is a critical issue. L6ss of the housing stock is also a critical problem in Foggy Bottom/West End, aggravated by the lack of dormitory construction on the GWU campus. Moreover, continued commercial, hotel, and institutional expansion has caused major traffic and parking problems, thus adding to the disruption of residential life. The Shaw and Logan Circle areas are experiencing some displacement due~to commercial and residential renovations and are affectediby commercial development. An overconcentration of community-based residential facilities threatens neighborhood stability in some areas D) Foreign government offices (chanceries) which locate in residentially zoned neighborhoods may destabilize residential neighborhoods. This!is a major problem in the Dupont Circle neighborhood 2) Development of the central employment area The Central Employment Area is the business and retail heart of the District and the metropolitan a~ea. Office use, in terms of square footage, is the larg@st commercial use in the Central Employment Area. The Central Employment Area also contains the largest amount of retail floor space and the greatest sales volume in the metropolitan area. It contains the major department stores and leading specialty shops of the region. The Central Employment Area also has numerous boutiques and restaurants and the largest number of hotels in the District. The term "Central Employment Area" is defined in section 107(5) of the Comprehensive Plan. It is bounded by Massachusetts Avenue~and H Street, N.W. on the north; Second Street, N.E. and S.E. on the east; the Southwest Freeway and Constitution Avenue west of 14th Street on the south; and by the Expressway, Virginia Avenue, N.W First Street, N.W Pennsylvania Avenue, N.W 22nd Street, N.W. and New Hampshire Avenue, N.W. on the west. Except for a small section east of the Capitol, all of the Central Employment Area is in Ward 2. Some idjacent commercial areas are closely related to this~area. Continued coordinated development and revitalization of the Central Employment Area is vital to Ward 2, and to the 127 entire city. Linkages between the commercial areas and the Monumental Core are also important 3) Creation of a living downtown A) Downtown Washington is the area between the Capitol and the White House, north of Pennsylvania Avenue to Massachusetts Avenue. This was the original commercial area of Washington. Beginning in the 1950s, development began to shift to the west and simultaneously the Downtown began to deteriorate B) Today, efforts to revitalize Downtown are being realized. The city is promoting a "Living Downtown This means a mix of land uses PrOducing activity during the day, in the evening and on the weekends. It also means a mix of new and old buildings to achieve a special design character for different areas of Downtown C) The Mayor’s Downtown Committee outlined recommendations for Downtown in 1982. Those recommended policies and objectives were adopted as the Downtown Element of the Comprehensive Plan. The D.C. Downtown Partnership was established in 1984 to implement the Downtown Plan D) The revitalization of Downtown now underway has important implications for the ward, especially adjacent areas such as Mount Vernon Square North, Northeast Number One, Shaw and Logan Circle. Major progress has been made towards achieving the land use targets outlined in the Downtown Plan. Progress is most evident in office, retail and hotel development but action will be needed to achieve housing in Downtown and adjacent areas the nqrth 4) Office development A) The need for office space to house public and private sector employment is the major "driver" of other development in the ward. Much of the new development to the year 2000 in the center of Ward 2, and in the Development Opportunity Areas, will be new office construction. It is important to achieve continuing office development in the District in the face of suburban competition. Office development in Downtown is now strong, but most Downtown sites will be developed by the year 2000. Therefore, it is important to provide new sites for office development in the Development Opportunity Areas, especially in the North CapitolStreet and South Capitol/Buzzard Point areas. An appropriate office environment must be created that meets the challenge of suburban office parks B) Emphasis on office development tends to focus on private office development. However, it is also important to obtain additional federal office space construction, especially in the Federal Triangle, the Southeast Federal Center and the Navy Yard 5) Hotel development. 128 ~rolled Ori~i A) Hotels are a key element of the economic development of Washington and are important activity generators. Ward 2 is the hotel center of the city. At the end of 1986, Ward 2 accounted for 74 of the 84 hotels in the city and 16,598 of the 19,920 hotel rooms. Hotels in Ward 2 are primarily concentrated in Downtown, the Connecticut Avenue area, and the West End, with smaller clusters in Dupont Circle and Southwest B) Major progress has been made in achieving hotel construction goals, but efforts are still necessary to reach, and if possible exceed, the target of 12,000 new rooms in the city in the 1980-2000 period. Approximately II,000 of these new hotel rooms would be in Ward 2. From 1980 to 1986, 6,644 new hotel rooms have been built in Ward 2. Locating hotels in strategic areas such as south of the Washington Convention Center isiespecially important. A new 956-room hotel opened in J~ne 1987 immediately south of the Convention Center C) Since many new hotel rooms have come on the market in a short period, there seems toibe a temporary over-supply. However, over the long term, additional hotels will be built to fulfill increased demand from visitors, tourists, business people and conventioneersJ D) Some citizen groups areiconcerned about the impact of hotel development on nearby residential areas, especially along Massachusetts Avenue north of Downtown, in Foggy Bottom, the West End and in Southwest. The Office of Planning recognizes these concerns and believes~ that the location and development of new hotels must be carefully coordinated to avoid adverse nelghborhood Impacts 6) Arts, culture, and educationll uses. Washington, D.C. is becoming one of the great arts and cultural/educational centers of the world. Many of these cultural and educational resources are located in or adjacent to Ward 2. Although these resources are available to all residents of the city and region, Ward 2 residents have a special advantage because of their proximity to these resources 7) Development Opportunity Areas A) Downtown is the current!area of major development in Ward 2. Development of Downt6wn should be largely completed over the next i0 to 15 years. The Comprehensive Plan Identifies the following 5 Development opportunity areas in Ward 2 i) Northeast One/Ecki~gton Yard North Capitol Street ii) Portal site iii) Buzzard Point/Near Southeast South Capitol Street 129 iv) H Street, N.E extending into Ward 6 and v) Mount Vernon Square B) The areas of Ward 2 enumerated in subparagraphs (A)(i v) are where major dev41opment will take place in the future especially as major!rebuilding of Downtown is completed C) In the Northeast One/Eckington Yard area, there are a number of interacting federal, city and commercial development issues. Development pressure has increased with the completion of the Trailwa~s Bus Terminal at First &amp;amp; K Streets, N.E. and recent efforts to turn the area into a transit hub. Union Station and ~djacent development is the southern anchor of this area D) The Buzzard Point/Near Southeast area now contains deteriorated public housing, light industry, marginal small businesses, a military installation, federal buildings and vacant sites, but has the potential for becoming a prime waterfront site and southern gateway into the city E) The Mount Vernon Square!area has potential for major development, including significant residential development, because of its proximity to Downtown. Development potential is especially strong north of Massachusetts Avenue, including the Mount,Vernon Square/UDC site and the Wax Museum renewal site 8) Major institutional complexes A) Ward 2 has two types oflmajor institutional complexes. Federal areas comprise the first type and large university campuses are the s4cond type. There are four major federal areas in the ward: Monumental Core (including West Potomac Park the Capitol Complex, Fort McNair, and the Southwest Federal Center/Washington Navy Yard. The linkages and relationships of these federal areas to the adjacent commercial and residential areas are especially important. Planning of these areas is within the overall planning framework established by the National Capital Planning Commission and carried out by the General Services Administration B) These federal areas need to relate to the adjacent commercial and residential areas of Ward 2. The Monumental Core and the Capitol complexes are especially important because they comprise large areas of the center of Ward 2, are the focus of visitor attention, and provide cultural attractions for city residents C) Two university campuses, George Washington and Georgetown, are located in Ward 2. The future development plans of these universities should not adversely impact surrounding, adjacent residential areas 9) Community and neighborhood shopping areas. 130 Enz’~ile Ortg j.nal A) Community and neighborhood shopping areas are essential parts of the convenience and character of the residential neighborhoods of Ward 2. They range in size and scale from corner stores, to small clusters of stores, and the major retail strips (Connecticut Avenue and 14th Street) to a mall (Waterside Mall Some neighborhoods in Ward 2 do not have adequate commercial and service establishments. In others, too much develop!ent is adversely affecting adjacent residential areas. Some cases, needed lower cost stores and service establishments are being displaced by higher price "upscale" es£ablishments. Certain kinds of commercial activity, such as fast food restaurants, can cause problems in residential neighborhoods. The impacts of fast food restaurants and liquor-licensed restaurants have been concer~s in some neighborhoods B) The Waterside Mall in SOuthwest has not become a vital commercial center due to high,rents and poor marketing. The opening of the Waterfront Metrorail Station may allow the mall to operate at least as a multi-neighborhood shopping center I0) Waterfront development Waterfront land is a great asset in th~ District of Columbia. Waterfront land may best be used ~s parkland, ¯ while adjoining sections may be used for mixed-use developments. A substantial amount of shoreline is in public ownership. Much of it is parkland administered by the National Park Service and accessible to the public. There are problems and opportunities all alodg the Ward 2 waterfront i) The Georgetown waterfront area is emerging as a major activity center, with new parkland west of the Washington Harbor complex. Additional improvements in the form of landscaping and open space are needed ii) Improvements are needed to the waterfront in the National Park Service areas. Evening concerts on the Watergate steps have been discontinued due to excessive noise from jets operating at National Airport iii) Thompson’s Boat House is in need of major structural repairs. The tidal flats next to East Potomac Park need to be cleaned up iv) Southwest waterfront remains relatively inaccessible and underused while the adjacent fish market, in need of physical improvements, continues to be supported by throngs of patrons v) The Fort McNair waterfront is relatively restricted to the public vi) The Buzzard Pointiand Navy Yard waterfronts represent vast untapped, resourceS. 131 vii) At present, there is no clearly articulated vision of how the waterfront areas in Ward 2 can be better used and how they relate to adjacent areas II) Metro station development Ward 2 is the focus of the Metrorail system, the place where the Red, Orange, Blue, Yellow and Green Lines converge. Ward 2 has 19 Metrorail stations in operation and four more under construction (Mount Vernon Square/UDC, Shaw, Waterfront and Navy Yard In addition, the U Street Station and the Capitol South Station are nearby. Consequently, Ward 2 has the best Metrorail service and access of any area of the city and region. Despite these advantages, development around the Metrorail stations in Ward 2 is uneven. At some stations, such as Farragut North and L’Enfant Plaza, the development pattern is essentially established. At other stations, such as Gallery Place, Union Station, and Navy Yard, there are still opportunities for development SEC. 1200.226. WARD 2 OBJECTIVES FOR LAND USE The objectives for land use are as follows I) To conserve and enhance existing residential neighborhoods in Ward 2 2) To create new residential neighborhoods SEC. 1200.227.

This is~especially important in the Mount Vernon Square North area and the Buzzard Point/Near Southeast area II) Encourage the Department of Recreation to undertake detailed, specific analyses of the!potential need for more recreational facilities in Shaw 12) Insist that the Department of Consumer and Regulatory Affairs (DCRA) and the Departmentiof Human Services (DHS) shall enforce zoning-based ordinance requirements concerning distance between community based residential facilities and evaluate impacts to date on neighborhood stability. Require that all community based residential facilities be registered with the District of Columbia. Consider establishing a moratorium on future community based residential facilities in neighborhoods where the over-concentration of CBRFs has had negative mneighborhood impacts, except that the moratorlu shall not violate the Fair Housing Amendments Act, approved March 12, 1989 (102 Stat. 1619; 42 U.S.C. 3601 et seq Fair Housing Act For the purposes of this paragraph, the term ’handicap’ has the same meaning as in section 802(h) of the Fair Housing Act (42 U.S.C. 3602(h 13) Insist that the Zoning Commission not amend the D.C. Zoning Regulations to permit the expansion and/or reconstruction of chancery facilities in those neighborhoods which are essentially residential in character 14) The Southwest Urban Renewal Plan (SWURP) serves in lieu of zoning. Within the next two years a Citizens’ Task Force shall be appointed to work with the Office of Planning to develop a zoning plan. Zoning must be phased in immediately upon termination of Section B of the Southwest Urban Renewal Plan in 1992; Section C-I in 1995; and Section C in 1996. During development of the zoning plans, no major changes in SWURP should be considered. Further, RLA shall seek out qualified developers for the underdeveloped parcels of SWURP as soon as possible. 133 15) To carry out the policy in the Comprehensive Plan of "conserving and maintaining the District’s sound, established neighborhoods through the strict application and enforcement of housing, building and zoning codes and maintenance of the general level of existing residential uses, densities, and heights the city should continue to enforce the Zoning regulations and recommendations of the Comprehensive Plan with respect to negative neighborhood impacts, especially of commercial expansion 16) Coordinate the management of various promotional activities in Ward 2, such as street festivals in order to maintain the integrity and function of adjacent residential areas 17) The Zoning Commission should place hotels, medical clinics, and doctors’ offices in a category other than "residential given their extremely negative impact on residential neighborhoods SEC. 1200.228. WARD 2 OBJECTIVES FOR OFFICE DEVELOPMENT The objectives for office development are as follows I) To encourage development of office buildings in appropriate locations in Ward 2, especially in the Central Employment Area and in Development Opportunity Areas 2) To retain and increase federal employment in Ward 2 in new federal buildings and in leased space SEC. 1200.229.

WARD 2 OBJECTIVE FOR METRO STATION DEVELOPMENT OBJECTIVE The objective for Metro station development is to achieve the optimum development of Metro station areas in terms of land use, transportation and urban design, related to the development of the surrounding area SEC. 1200.243. WARD 2 ACTIONS IN SUPPORT OF THE METRO STATION DEVELOPMENT OBJECTIVE The actions in support of the Metro station development objective are as follows i) Continue to improve the land~use mix and urban design qualities of operating Metrorail Downtown where the development pattern is essentially established (Farragut North, Foggy Bottom, Farragut West, McPherson, Smithsonian and L’Enfant Plaza The Dupont Circle Metro stop Q Street station should be maintained as a plaza to be compatible with the adjacent residential neighborhood 2) Undertake additional efforts to improve the land use mix and urban design qualities of operating Metrorail stations when the development pattern is not yet fully established (Metro Center, Gallery Place, Judiciary Square, Union Station, Federal triangle, Federal Center Southwest and Archives 3) Undertake special efforts to plan the land-use mix and urban design character for the area where Metrorail Stations are now under construction (Mount Vernon Square/UDC, Shaw and Navy Yard 4) Undertake coordinated planning for nearby Metrorail stations (Capitol South and U Street The Office of Planning shall submit to the Zoning Commission necessary zoning changes, program capital improvements and take other actions in accord with small area plans Uses, density, 139 and height limits should be generally compatible with existing adjacent land uses or in accordance with small area plans 5) Encourage WMATA and DPW to improve information and directional signs to Metro station areas Providing maps and signs at Metro stations in Ward 2 is especially important because of the large volume of visitors in the area who do not know the city 6) Develop a special character Metro Place at Metrorail stations through the design of new development, retention of historic buildings, landscaping, art works, and special activities SUBTITLE 3 "Sec. 1200.300 WARD 3 PLAN Reserved for future adoption SUBTITLE "Sec. 1200.400 WARD 4 PLAN Reserved for future adoption SUBTITLE 5 "Sec. 1200.500 adoption WARD 5 PLAN Reserved for future 140 Kur ~l~e~Or~inal SUBTITLE 6 "SEC. 1200. 600 "SEC. 1200. 601 "SEC. 1200. 602 "SEC. 1200.603 "SEC. 1200.604 "SEC. 1200.605 "SEC. 1200.606 "SEC. 1200.607 "SEC. 1200.608 "SEC. 1200.609 "SEC. 1200.610 "SEC. 1200.611 "SEC. 1200.612 "SEC. 1200.613 "SEC. 1200.614 "SEC. 1200.615 "SEC. 1200 616 "SEC. 1200.617 "SEC. 1200.618 "SEC. 1200.619 "SEC. 1200.620 "SECo 1200.621 "SEC. 1200.622 "SEC. 1200.623 "SEC. 1200.624 "SEC. 1200.625 "SEC. 1200.626 "SEC. 1200.627 "WARD 6 PLAN "TABLE OF CONTENTS WARD 6 ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT WARD 6 OBJECTIVES FOR ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT WARD 6 POLICIES IN SUPPORT OF ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT OBJECTIVES WARD 6 ACTIONS TO IMPLEMENT THE PLAN: ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT WARD 6 HOUSING WARD 6 OBJECTIVES FOR HOUSING WARD 6 POLICIES IN SUPPORT OF HOUSING OBJECTIVES WARD 6 ACTIONS TO IMPLEMENT THE PLAN: HOUSING WARD 6 ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION WARD 6 OBJECTIVES FOR ENVIRONMENT PROTECTION WARD 6 POLICIES IN SUPPORT OF ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION WARD 6 ACTIONS TO IMPLEMENT THE PLAN: ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION WARD 6 TRANSPORTATION WARD 6 OBJECTIVES FOR TRANSPORTATION WARD 6 POLICIES IN SUPPORT OF TRANSPORTATION OBJECTIVES WARD 6 ACTIONS TO IMPLEMENT THE PLAN: TRANSPORTATION WARD 6 PUBLIC FACILITIES WARD 6 OBJECTIVES FOR PUBLIC FACILITIES WARD 6 POLICIES IN SUPPORT OF PUBLIC FACILITIES OBJECTIVES WARD 6 ACTIONS TO IMPLEMENT THE PLAN: PUBLIC FACILITIES WARD 6 URBAN DESIGN WARD 6 OBJECTIVES FOR URBAN DESIGN WARD 6 POLICIES IN SUPPORT OF URBAN DESIGN WARD 6 ACTIONS TO IMPLEMENT THE PLAN: URBAN~DESIGN WARD 6 PRESERVATION AND HISTORIC FEATURES WARD 6 OBJECTIVES FOR PRESERVATION AND HISTORIC FEATURES WARD 6 POLICIES IN SUPPORT OF PRESERVATION AND HISTORIC 141 SEC. 1200. 628 "SEC. 1200. 629 "SEC. 1200. 630 "SEC. 1200. 631 "SEC. 1200. 632 "SEC. 1200. 633 "SEC. 1200. 634 "SEC. 1200. 635 "SEC. 1200. 636 FEATURES WARD 6 HUMAN SERVICES WARD 6 OBJECTIVES FOR HUMAN SERVICES WARD 6 POLICIES IN SUPPORT OF HUMAN SERVICES OBJECTIVES WARD 6 ACTIONS TO IMPLEMENT THE PLAN: HUMAN SERVICES WARD 6 LAND USE WARD 6 OBJECTIVES FOR LAND USE WARD 6 POLICIES IN SUPPORT OF LAND USE OBJECTIVES WARD 6 ACTIONS TO IMPLEMENT THE PLAN: LAND USE WARD 6 ACTIONS TO IMPLEMENT THE PLAN: OTHER CHANGES "SEC. 1200.601. WARD 6 ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT a) Ward 6 offers an abundance of economic opportunity within its commercial area. These opportunities can be enhanced by a variety of actions, including land use studies, tailored to the different areas of the ward, small area studies, parking and loading studies, streetscape plans, tax abatement schemes and facade improvement grants and loans. Economic development themes in the ward are almost exclusively in two areas: office development and small retail business which will serve both the office and residential communities. In this regard special efforts should be made to ensure that development in Ward 6 does not compete with development in other wards on the fringe of the ward, including the Union Station development in Near Northeast in Ward 2; the Hechinger development in N.E. in Ward 5; the potential development in the Navy Yard and along M Street, S.E in Ward 2; and the opening of the Anacostia Metro Station on the Green Line in Ward 8. The issue in Ward 6 will be how to manage this development in the best interests of the Ward 6 community and the city, as a whole. There are virtually no industrial areas in the ward except for small parcels, which are, for the most part, incompatible with current neighborhood uses b) Job opportunities within and immediately adjacent to the ward abound, provided there is requisite job training available. The many retail establishments at Union Station, along H Street, N.E at the Hechinger Mall, and along Pennsylvania Avenue, S.E offer abundant retail sales opportunities. Jobs at the federal level and with the District government can be found in large numbers at the Capitol, D.C. General Hospital, Capitol Hill Hospital, and at the various prison and jail facilities. There are many office jobs at the banks and associations located along 14,2 Pennsylvania Avenue and in the Union Station area. Finally, there are a myraid of jobs available in the building trades involving both large-scale development and the many remodeling activities within the ward’s two historic districts. The issue is not lack of jobs but training to qualify for the jobs c) Much of the economic activity throughout the ward has specialized characteristics which need to be assessed in developing the planning, land use, parking, and loading regulations necessary to promote businesses. The area encompassed by the Capitol Interest Overlay Zone extends from the Capitol grounds to 6th Street, S.E and N.E. from the Freeway on the south to F Street on the north. Within that zone are a number of important commercial areas: Pennsylvania Avenue, S.E 2nd Street, S.E from Massachusetts Avenue north to H Street, N.E Massachusetts Avenue, N.E. around Stanton Park, and 2nd Street, N.Eo, from Massachusetts Avenue to F Street. This area serves both the large daytime populations working in and visiting the Capitol as well as the immediately adjacent residential neighborhoods. The key issue is to provide a variety of retail services and to resist the trend toward bars and restaurants, exclusively d) Similar considerations exist along both Pennsylvania Avenue, S.E above the CID and along H Street, N.E. A combination of the 600 block of Pennsylvania Avenue, S.E the Eastern Market Metro stop, 7th Street, S.E between 6th and 9th Streets, North Carolina Avenue, and the Freeway and 8th Street between the Metro stop and Navy Yard (Market Row with Eastern Market in the middle) and 9th Street, S.E between the Metro stop and the Navy Yard constitute the Capitol Hill Central Business District. This area is already under substantial development: Eastern Market revitilization, Penn Medical Building, the Kresge Building, the Miller Building, and the row of buildings across from the Market e) East of 9th Street, N.E on Pennsylvania Avenue, there is a need to study both the Avenue itself and for a small-area study at the intersection of the Avenue, Potomac Avenue and 14th Street, S.E where the Potomac Avenue Metro Station is located. Such a study would help rationalize conflicting land uses in the area. In addition, with the entire length of Pennsylvania Avenue, S.E as a designated landmark and the primary entrance to the Capitol from the east, a special streetscape plan and land use control should be developed. At the Barney Circle end of the Avenue, there is already a proliferation of fast-food outlets and abandoned service stations which discourage investment in facilities of higher quality as well as denigrate the landmark stature of the Avenue. 14,3 f) H Street, N.E has a different character than Pennsylvania Avenue, S.E but similar problems. At one time it was the second busiest commercial area in the District. That function diminished in the 1960’s and nearly disappeared after the riots of 1968. The H Street corridor has experienced some revitalization as a result of an Urban Renewal Plan; however, the development of the Hechinger Mall on the east end of the corridor and the substantial office and retail space in the area of Union Station on the west end tend to drain off retail investment and customers from the rest of H Street. This polarization of economic activity needs to be considered in reviewing H Street development. Between the two ends of heavy development, H Street may have to assume a special character in order to fully develop its commercial potential g) An inter-ward, under-utilized economic development opportunity is Benning Road, N.E from the Hechinger Mall to the Anacostia River. Its potential needs to be studied. Certain retail possibilities should be considered for this area, including extending the Stadium Farmers Market to Benning Road and the re-creation of an automobile dealership which once existed there h) Scattered throughout the west end of the Ward are short strips of commercial activity which need to be studied in order to understand and assess how they could better function or whether their land use should change. These areas include llth Street, S.E. just off Pennsylvania Avenue; 8th Street, N.W north of Capitol Hill Hospital; the Potomac Avenue, Pennsylvania Avenue, 14th Street area and various strips along 15th Street, S.E. and N.E. Also scattered throughout the area are non-conforming land uses most of which are now neighborhood-related services: drug stores, corner groceries, dry cleaners, hair dressers, etc. These stores not only perform essential services for the community but also give the area vitality i) On the east side of the ward there is a detailed plan for economic and related development in Old Anacostia developed by the Anacostia Coordinating Council and endorsed by most of the affected Ward 6 groups and relevant public officials. It is published as a Development~Concept Plan entitled "Old Anacostia: A Capital Gain and has been circulated widely in the community for more than three years. It involves a variety of public agency actions and policies, which are enumerated in the relevant implementation sections contained in the ward 6 Plan. Included in the Development Concept Plan areprovisions for streetscape improvements, basic land use plans and appropriate controls for future development of key sites, traffic and parking improvements, and historic preservation. 14.4 j) The Old Anacostia Development Concept Plan is a legitimate small-area plan within the context of the city’s comprehensive plan and is adopted as such as part of the Ward 6 Plan SEC. 1200.602. WARD 6 OBJECTIVES FOR ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT The objectives for economic development are as follows I) To encourage a range of commercial services and facilities for Ward 6 residents through appropriate development of commercial areas when needed and to upgrade commercial areas such as the Martin Luther King, Jr Avenue, S.E and Good Hope Road, S.E corridors, the H Street, N.E. and Benning Road, N.E corridor, Pennsylvania Avenue, S.E corridor, 7th and 8th Streets, S.E 2) To stimulate economic activity and employment opportunities and growth consistent with the respective needs of the various neighborhoods in Ward 6 SEC. 1200.603. WARD 6 POLICIES IN SUPPORT OF ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT The policies in support of economic development are as follows I) Provide a range of commercial facilities and services within commercial corridors in Ward 6 2) Ensure that new commercial developments in Ward 6 are consistent with the character of the adjacent historic districts 3) Ensure that the redevelopment of the commercial corridors, such as H Street, N.E Martin Luther King, Jr Avenue, S.E and Good Hope Road, S.E include a large percentage of neighborhood-serving commercial uses 4) Where development opportunities exist, the city and the Ward 6 community should work to ensure that they are consistent with neighborhood and city objectives SEC. 1200.604. WARD 6 ACTIONS TO IMPLEMENT THE PLAN: ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT The actions to implement economic development are as follows I) Prepare comprehensive analysis of land use in Massachusetts Avenue, N.E 7th and 8th Streets, S.E and Pennsylvania Avenue, S.E commercial corridors 2) Select sites for increased FAR in commercial district 3) Designate area around Potomac Avenue Metro station as a Special Treatment Area. Boundaries of special study area are llth Street, S.E. on the west (including the llth Street commercial corridor D Street, S.E. on the north, Kentucky Avenue on the east, and Southeast/Southwest 145 Freeway on the south. Special Treatment Area study to include development of underutilized commercial sites, e.g Bogan property at 14th and Potomac Avenue, S.E protection of residential properties and neighborhoods in the study area, including the residential neighborhood south of Pennsylvania Avenue bounded by 13th Street, S.E on the west, Pennsylvania Avenue on the north, 15th Street, S.E on the east, and the Southeast/Southwest Freeway on the south. Special Treatment Area analysis to emphasize economic development potential in balance with predominately residential character of the area 4) Ensure that the future development and/or expansion of Capitol grounds conforms with guidelines and sequences set out in Master Plan with U.S. Capitol 5) Ensure that future development of land transferred from the Architect of the Capitol to the District private ownership conforms with existing uses in adjacent and surrounding areas 6) Encourage and concentrate medical-related and neighborhood serving commercial uses in area of 8th Street, N.E between C &amp;amp; E Streets. This area is currently designated low density commercial, neighborhood business center 7) Restore Eastern Market as retail meat, produce center and farmers’ row built around core of existing Farmers’ Market. Community meeting and performing and visual arts space to be included in improvement program 8) Create Capitol Hill Central Business District shopping area by integrating Market Row, Pennsylvania Avenue, S.E 6th Street, S.E to 9th Street, S.E and Barracks Row retail areas through the device of a special treatment area 9) Reassess H Street, N.E Corridor Urban Renewal Plan to account for changed economic development potential in corridor. Consider entirely new Urban Renewal Plan to provide incentives for housing, community services, neighborhood recreation facilities i0) Confine commercial activities to Benning Road, N.E. frontage in Kingman Park area of the ward II) retain open-air Farmers’ Market at Stadium/Armory parking lots 12) Improve range and quality of retail business along 15th Street, S.E and upgrade neighborhood convenience/shopping services 13) Promote/sustain economic vitality of business concerns lawfully established and operating on Pennsylvania Avenue, S.E 7th and 8th Streets, S.E and Massachusetts Avenue, N.E commercial corridors. 14,6 14) Protect adjacent residential neighborhoods in Northeast against pressures for conversion to retail and office uses generated by Union Station development 15) Develop old Anacostia as an integrated retail small office, and light ~ndustrial employment/service center designed to complement the area’s historic district and stable neighborhoods 16) Rehabilitate Good Hope/Naylor shopping area with Sears as anchor. Improve type and mix of services to meet community needs 17) Limit existing commercial facilities to present sites and densities in Twining/Greenway area of Ward 6. Upgrade appearance of facilities and improve type and mix of services available to meet community needs. Commercial districts requiring renovation are those located at Nelson Street and Minnesota Avenue, S.E and Benning Road, S.E and Pennsylvania Avenue and Minnesota Avenues, S.E 18) Maintain and improve Good Hope Road commercial area in a manner compatible with residential character of Fairlawn and Old Anacostia neighborhoods 19) Upgrade the level of services and outlets along the Good Hope Road commercial corridor 20) Designate a new special treatment area between Eastern Market Metro, 8th and 7th Streets, S.E0 between Pennsylvania Avenue and the expressway: Pennsylvania Avenue from 6th Street to 9th Street, S.E 7th and 8th Streets, from Pennsylvania to expressway, 7th Street, S.E. from Pennsylvania Avenue to North Carolina Avenue SEC.1200.605. WARD 6 HOUSING a) Ward 6 has a great diversity of housing available to its residents. The housing stock ranges from large public housing projects to smaller subsidized units, to large row-house districts, to neighborhoods of detached single-family homes. The west end of the ward contains the bulk of the older row-house neighborhoods, many of which were built in the 19th century and are part of the Capitol Hill Historic District. Although the western portion of the ward (west of the Anacostia River) is relatively small in land area, its population density is high due to the row-house character of its housing. There are also a few scattered small apartment houses throughout the west side of the ward, many of which have been converted to condominiums b) On the east side of the ward, the Old Anacostia Historic District contains a number of wooden, detached houses, many of which req~ire substantial renovation in order to maintain their residential uses. These are interspersed with large, multifamily units built in the 1950s and 1960s to accommodate families displaced in the i~7 ~n~r~-e~Orlginal redevelopment of Southwest. Many of these are vacant and all require substantial renovation. They are, as a rule, built on too large a scale and are too densely clustered to be compatible with the underlying neighborhood. Some of these buildings should be demolished at the end of their useful lives and replaced with smaller, compatible buildings c) The Twining/Greenway neighborhood contains a large concentration of small, detached houses. This neighborhood, in particular, has been encroached upon by a number of small apartment houses which tend to undermine the integrity of the area as a single-family residential neighborhood. There are also several brick row-house neighborhoods in the eastern section of the ward. Much of the housing east of the Anacostia River requires additional maintenance. Homeowners require assistance in their efforts to maintain their properties, thus stabilizing the residential quality of the area d) There is little vacant property available for development in Ward 6. The vacant parcels that exist are small in size and most suitable for infill development. Increasing the housing supply and helping the homeowner afford his or her property can be accomplished by renting portions of the structures that have two units, i.e English basements. Other ways to increase the housing supply include conversion of schools and churches to apartments and condominiums, and by creating new apartment development along H Street, N.E and Pennsylvania Avenue, S.E e) Although more housing units are rented than are owned in Ward 6, recent trends show an increase in home ownership. Since home ownership is a stabilizing force in residential neighborhoods, public policy needs to strengthen that trend by a number of means, including provision of subsidies for first-owner mortgages and tax abatements for ownership. Another positive trend involves assisting public housing residents to own their units, thus stabilizing those projects. Whether public’housing tenants become owners, or continue as renters, they need to be encouraged and assisted to properly maintain the homes they occupy SEC. 1200.606. WARD 6 OBJECTIVES FOR HOUSING The objectives for housing are as follows i) To maintain and strengthen the quality and construction of housing in the various neighborhoods throughout Ward 6 2) To stimulate production in Ward 6 of new and rehabilitated housing, particularly in the Old Anacostia Historic District, Fairlawn and Woodlawn neighborhoods, to 148 provide housing opportunities to accommodate and allow for residential growth and stability according to area needs SEC. 1200.607. WARD 6 POLICIES IN SUPPORT OF HOUSING OBJECTIVES The policies in support of housing objectives are as follows i) Maintain the housing stock through the provision of additional loans and grants to Ward 6 homeowners for housing rehabilitation, appropriate changes in regulatory codes and encouragement of in-fill development on vacant lots 2) Discourage encroachment of the non-residential uses in residential areas 3) Stimulate private investment in housing in Ward 6 and expand home ownership opportunities 4) Provide new housing in Ward 6 area through the conversion of appropriate non-residential structures that have outlived their current use, such as churches, warehouses, schools and other public facilities SEC. 1200.608. WARD 6 ACTIONS TO IMPLEMENT~THE PLAN: HOUSING The actions to implement housing are as follows I) Preserve primarily moderate-density residential character of area bordering U.S. Capitol grounds 2) Preserve character of residential neighborhoods. Curtail conversions of residential properties to commercial/office use 3) Promote preservation and enhancement of low- and moderate-income housing development opportunities, and provide incentives to encourage low- and moderate-income home ownership 4) Transient housing (inns, small hotels, etc should be designed in a manner compatible with the Ward’s predominantly residential character 5) Prohibit further carriage-house conversions and resulting higher densities 6) Complete original car barn PUD 7) Encourage construction of new and infill housing in and around Old Anacostia Historic~District with no increased densities 8) Provide incentives to encour@ge home ownership and occupancy 9) Improve the mix of subsidized and nonsubsidized dwelling units to enhance neighborhood stability. 149 Enrolle~ Or ~gi I0) Rehabilitate and maintain selected public housing projects in Ward 6. Renovate and convert selected units as owner-occupied cooperative housing Ii) Pursue renovation of Rose’s Row (1200 block of U Street, S.E for single family dwellings as is now ocurring 12) Prepare alternative site development plans for the housing along east side of Martin Luther King, Jr Avenue between Morris Road and Howard Road in conjunction with Ward 8 13) Establish community-based financing system to promote home ownership in Old Anacostia neighborhood 14) Preserve residential character of Twining/Greenway neighborhood with no increased density 15) Rehabilitate deteriorating housing stock in Twining/Greenway neighborhood, especially small, single-family houses west of Minnesota Avenue, S.E 16) Encourage conversion of low-rise apartment buildings in Twining/Greenway neighborhood to owner occupied 17) Preserve residential character of Fairlawn neighborhood with no increased densities 18) Rehabilitate deteriorating housing stock in Fairlawn neighborhood, primarily single-family homes and small apartment buildings in subarea 19) Preserve residential character of Woodlawn neighborhood, with no increased density housing 20) Inventory all unoccupied or boarded-up dwellings in the Ward and act to return these dwellings to habitable uses SEC. 1200.609. WARD 6 ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION a) Enviror~ental protection is an issue that has become increasingly important over the past decade. The Potomac River, which was the model cleanup project for the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency’s water quality improvement efforts, is being restored to its former state and once again supports a broad range of aquatic life. Air quality in the District has improved substantially since the mid-1960s b) Environmental protection is a regional concern that often must rely on regional solutions for success. Maryland, Virginia and the District of Columbia have increased their cooperative efforts to improve environmental quality. Of particular importance to Ward 6 are the efforts currently underway by the District of Columbia and the State of Maryland to improve conditions in the Anacostia River and its tributaries. These efforts are part of a comprehensive program for restoring the Chesapeake Bay being undertaken by 150 ¯ ur o 1 le l Oz,$gina the District, Maryland, Virginia, Delaware and Pennsylvania under the guidelines of the Environmental Protection Agency c) Pollution of the Anacostia River and deterioration of its shorelines present serious environmental problems. These conditions have had negative consequences for aquatic life and have limited use of the river for recreational purposes. Now the Anacostia River Basin is receiving the attention given the P6tomac River during its cleanup efforts. The river cleanup project will require the combined efforts of the District Prince George’s County and the National Park Service. In the District, high traffic volume, poor water quality, soil erosion and other concerns are being approached with new awareness. The Department of Public Works (DPW) and other District government agencies are implementing improvements in sewer maintenance and medical waste management. Guidelines for homeowners to help improve environmental quality are provided by DCRA d) The Swirl Concentrator, a compute~-operated interim sewage treatment plant, recently began operating just east of D.C. General Hospital. The pla~t will help alleviate sewage capacity problems at Blue P~ains Wastewater Treatment Plant e) With the District government’s renewed efforts to improve environmental quality, progress is b4ing made. The first stages of the long-awaited Anacostia River cleanup is beginning. The Department of Public Works is implementing its Combined Sewer Overflow Abatement MasteriPlan. The Swirl Concentrator is part of that plan’s implementation. Improvements to other aspects of the wastewa~er and stormwater management system are also included. These capital improvements will also improve water quality in the Anacostia River. Heavy traffic volumes along the ward’s major arterials cause hazardous air quality conditions for surrounding neighborhoods. The U.S. Capitol-Power Plant operations have raised neighborhood concern about air quality conditions. In addition, DPW and the Council of Governments are developing improved air quality management procedures. Increasing use of mass transit is an important feature in improving air quality f) Soil erosion in Fairlawn and Old Anacostia threatens the neighborhood quality. Erosion!along the southwest section of Fort Stanton Park is beginning to effect trees in that area of the park g) The Department of Public Works has helped improve neighborhood environmental quality and has intenslfied efforts to regularly clean alleys, schedule bulk trash collection, and remove downed trees and othe~ road hazards. 151 ~olle~ O~Igi SEC. 1200.610. WARD 6 OBJECTIVES FOR ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION The objectives for environmental protection are as follows I) To improve the quality of water in the District’s rivers and streams to meet public health and water quality standards and to maintain the physical, chemical and biological integrity of these watercourses for multiple uses, including recreation 2) To protect the overall environmental quality of the Ward 6 land areas by preventing furth4r soil erosion, promoting the restoration of eroded areas and enforcing prohibitions against illegal dumping and other destructive practices 3) Reduce the level of noise and litter, and improve air quality SEC. 1200.611. WARD 6 POLICIES IN SUPPORT OF ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION OBJECTIVES The policies in support of environmental prote tion objectives are as follows I) Minimize overflows of untreated sewage from the combined sewerage system, and develop and implement a reliable program of solid waste and sludge disposal that is cost-effective, environmentally sound, and fdlly coordinated with all responsive jurisdictions and regulatory bodies 2) Prevent further sedimentation of stream beds and valleys, whenever possible 3) Regulate land development activities including public spaces, throughout the Ward!6 area to protect natural features, prevent soil erosion, and prohibit construction practices that produce unstable soil and hillside conditions 4) Regulate noise levels of buses, trucks, and airplanes and provide alternative routes where practicable SEC. 1200.612. WARD 6 ACTIONS TO IMPLEMENTITHE PLAN: ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION The actions to implement environmental protection are as follows I) Control gaseous and particulate emissions from the Capitol Power Plant and noise emissions from the Refrigeration Plant 2) Identify appropriate authority and establish mechanism, including negotiated District of Columbia/Architect of the Capitol agreement,.if necessary, to control Capitol Power and Refrigeration Plant emissions 3) Protect residential neighborhoods from tour bus-generated congestion, noise and noxious emissions. 152 4) Take appropriate steps to protect and maximize overall quality 5) Protect adjacent residential and commercial areas from adverse affect of Southwest/Southeast Freeway, including noxious emissions, visual and noise blight 6) Control diesel emissions and tunnel fan blowouts of accumulated smoke at mouth of Washington Terminal Company (Amtrack) tunnel, D Street and New Jersey Avenue, S.E 7) Protect surrounding residential neighborhood from oil spillage and other adverse environmental effects caused by Johnny Matthews Fuel Service, 630 14th Street, N.E. Provide appropriate screening and buffering of use from residential neighborhood 8) Rebrick or repave, as appropriate, alleys and public easements through the Ward to curtail soil erosion 9) Provide protection for residential neighborhoods against adverse effects of activities at adjacent major public facilities. Limit hours for large-scale public entertainment events--such as activities later than II:00 p.m. Divert/reroute commuter traffic around neighborhood to reduce noise, air, and glare pollution. Provide landscape screening along 19th Street I0) Abate soil erosion conditions associated with over-building and inappropriate site design ii) Provide noise abatement structures and landscaping to shield neighborhoods abutting Anacostia Freeway 12) Ensure landscaping treatment of Anacostia Metro station Kiss-and-Ride parking and bus storage areas to mitigate glare, dust, noise and visual effects 13) Provide security fencing, landscaping, and noise barriers between Conrail switching yards and trackage to protect adjoining residential neighborhoods against adverse effects and hazards 14) Initiate action to abate air.pollution generated by Conrail operations and adjacent switching yard 15) Abate soil erosion conditions associated with over-building and inappropriate site design, with particular attention to the area adjacent to the Marbury Plaza apartment site 16) Develop a comprehensive multi-material recycling plan for waste products SEC. 1200. 613. WARD 6 TRANSPORTATION a) The area of Ward 6 west of the Anacostia River is served by a combination of public transportation systems making automobile usage for local trips by its residents almost unnecessary. The east side of the River one of 153 the most transit-dependent sections of the city is served by Metrobus and is slated for Metrorail service when the Green Line Anacostia Station opens in late 1991. Unfortunately, most of the ward, particularly the west side, is intersected by auto commuter routes serving nearby Maryland residents and residents of the Anacostia area of the District. There are four Metrorail stations within the ward and two immediately adjacent. The Capitol complex and close-in Capitol Hill are served by two stations: Capitol South and Union Station. Southeast Capitol Hill is served by Eastern Market, Potomac Avenue and Stadium/Armory stations. Old Anacostia will soon be served:by the Anacostia Green Line station. Major bus routes transverse the ward. Train and intercity bus service is available at or near Union Station. National Airport is easily accessible via the Southeast/Southwest Freeway or the Blue Line Metro route. It should also be noted that the wide sidewalks and street trees make walking to work pleasurable for Capitol Hill residents b) The most difficult transportation issue is the role of the automobile. Accommodation of residents’ automobiles is a difficult problem and a challenge in what is primarily a series of 19th century neighborhoods. Requiring a parking spot in this area needs reexamination. Requiring a parking spot in each new residence often leads to a curb cut with a loss of on-street parking and no replacement because the new parking space is often not used for parking. Similarly, the blanket policy of grandfathering parking for existing buildings in the Historic District achieves uneven results c) A major success, but one needing further refinement, is permit parking. There needs to be an examination of whether or not residents of the ward are abusing permit parking and using the streets near Metro stops as all-day parking lots. Enforcement of this problem needs to be evaluated, and the issue of extending permit parking needs to be addressed. There is also the problem of all-day parkers from the Capitol complex, the Library of Congress, and employees of business who simply move their cars every two hours to stay within the regulatory limits d) A major problem in Ward 6 on the east and west sides of the river, is the use of neighborhood streets as commuter thoroughfares. This problem is exacerbated by frequent severe congestion and tie-ups along major commuter arterials. The situation is getting worse because of extensive office and retail development in the Union Station area and increasing residential development in Maryland from the District line to Annapolis. One proposal is the development of the Barney Circle Freeway project, which includes linkages from 1-295 to the Southwest Freeway at 154 Barney Circle, with an additional linkage at Barney Circle by means of a roadway between East Capitol Street and the Southeast Freeway. While the design and purpose of the Barney Circle Freeway were established after’extensive consultation with Capitol Hill residents, its effects on the ward remain uncertain. That plan calls for ~dditional lanes within the existing Southeast Freeway roadbed, and one-way streets in the Capitol Hill area will be returned to two-way traffic. The stated purpose is to direct commuter traffic into the District using commercial streets or freeways built to accommodate such traffic. This will not solve the problem but may give some relief while other!techniques are employed, such as greater emphasis on van pooling, use of buses, Metro, and HOV lanes. Commuter traffic remains one of the biggest threats to the quality of residential life in Ward 6 e) Development east of the river, spurred by the Anacostia Metro site, is provoking parking problems similar to those that plague Capitol Hill. The Metro garage planned for the Anacostia Metro station will not provide all necessary parking. Also, the economic revitalization of the Good Hope Road corridor depends upon shoppers being able to park to use the stores SEC. 1200.614. WARD 6 OBJECTIVES FOR TRANSPORTATION The objectives for transportation are as follows I) To provide an adequate balanced circulation system, properly related to residential, commercial/retail, and other land uses, which will enhance the aesthetic and environmental characteristics along streets in the Ward 6 area as well as to minimize traffic congestion 2) To develop, as appropriate, a network of trails, including hiking and biking, designed to connect residential, employment, education, and open space areas and to provide for the journey-to-work needs of Ward 6 residents. Provide secure bicycle racks in appropriate areas including Metro stations 3) To integrate circulation facilities with the patterns of development and the natural environment in the Ward 6 areas in a manner that will minimize noise and air pollution and at the same time provide for the safe, convenient movement of people and goods 4) To support the optimum use of mass transit by residents of Ward 6 and by workers, visitors, and tourists who come to the ward SEC. 1200.615. WARD 6 POLICIES IN SUPPORT OF TRANSPORTATION OBJECTIVES The policies in support of transportation are as follows: 155 F~olle~ OPigi i) Develop a pathway system in the Ward 6 areas that interconnects neighborhoods, employment, recreation, schools, and open space areas, where feasible, with access to the Metro system 2) Seek to ensure that development adjacent to the Ward 6 Metrorail Stations enhances ridership 3) Minimize conflicts between vehicular and pedestrian traffic 4) Work with the Architect of the Capitol to reduce parking and traffic impacts in areas adjacent to the Capitol as a result of office development 5) Reduce the number of one-way streets in the Capitol Hill Historic District 6) Give increased attention to bus service east of the river SEC. 1200.616. WARD 6 ACTIONS TO IMPLEMENT THE PLAN: TRANSPORTATION The actions to implement transportation are as follows I) Coordinate proposed street closings and/or re-routings by Architect of the Capitol with the city government 2) Work with the Capitol Hill Traffic Management Task Force and other citizen traffic groups to develop a plan to reduce traffic congestion throughout the ward 3) Create permit parking subzones near Metro stops and within vicinities. Protect parking for current residents, including a prohibition of meters in residential blocks 4) Perform parking and loading studies for all the major commercial/retail areas in the ward with a view to accommodating shoppers and worker needs for parking in suitable locations, and facilities that are integrated visually into these areas and the surrounding residential neighborhoods 5) Provide adequate and accessible short-term parking for Eastern Market customers as part of Eastern Market improvement program 6) Enforce regulations regarding tour bus routes, parking, and idling to protect residential neighborhoods. Problems to be addressed cooperatively between the District and the Architect of the Capitol 7) Enforce residential parking restrictions in neighborhoods surrounding the Capitol precinct. Establish and enforce special residential parking permit subzones along streets near the Capitol, near Metro stops, and elsewhere as needed in the ward. 156 8) Establish frequent surface transportation between Capitol South and Union Station Metro stops to encourage Metro use and reduce commuter traffic and parking in surrounding neighborhoods 9) Prepare detailed transportation plan for Pennsylvania Avenue corridor to address impacts of zoning regulation changes in commercial corridor, access to Metrorail and connecting buses, and designation/use of Pennsylvania Avenue as ceremonial route to the U.S. Capitol i0) Prepare comprehensive Ward 6 parking and loading study, including comprehensive analysis of residential and commercial requirements II) Maintain existing bus services in the near Northeast section of the ward and expand transit access to Hechinger Mall, including initiation of jitney/shuttle service between Hechinger Mall and surrounding neighborhoods 12) Maintain current levels of bus service on Benning Road, N.E 13) Curtail commuter traffic along C Street, N.E East Capitol Street, Independence Avenue, S.E. and 17th Street, S.E 14) Promote more effective use of stadium parking lots in support of commuter use of Metro, including the provision of bike racks at all Metro stations 15) Establish traffic management strategies to separate local traffic from through-traffic within adjacent residential neighborhoods, route through-traffic around identified neighborhood enclaves if possible, and complete segments of the highway and street system necessary for smooth traffic flow and the reduction of commuter traffic in residential neighborhoods 16) Establish Eastern Market Metro Park as a major exchange between the Blue Line and bus routes servicing southeast Washington. Modifications to Eastern Market Metro Park to include necessary changes in existing traffic and pedestrian circulation as well as appropriate landscaping, lighting, bus shelter and street furniture improvements 17) Complete construction of Anacostia station and extension of Metro Green line to Prince George’s County 18) Provide improved pedestrian and vehicular access to Anacostia Park recreation areas 19) Adopt TSM/TIP measures to mitigate traffic circulation/congestion problems at major intersections including Good Hope Road/Alabama Avenue, S.E Good Hope Road/Martin Luther King, Jr Avenue/W Street, S.E and Good Hope Road and Minnesota Avenue, S.E 20) Provide pedestrian circulation connection between Metro parking garage and Martin Luther King, Jr 157 Avenue via Chicago Street and new freeway pedestrian overpass 21) Reduce traffic congestion at the intersection of Minnesota and Pennsylvania Avenues 22) Improve accessibility of Woodlawn and Fairlawn neighborhoods to public transportation 23) Enforce the use of Fairlawn Avenue south of Pennsylvania Avenue as a one-way street, as officially designated 24) Improve the frequency of bus circulation on all routes east of the river 25) Prepare a detailed transportation plan to address the impact of the Anacostia Metro station on primary and secondary thoroughfares in the vicinity thereof, access to Metrorail and connecting buses, and pedestrian access to Metrorail 26) Implement left turn interchange from Sousa Bridge eastbound onto 1-295 northbound 27) Establish a Traffic Management District for areas near Union Station and SoE. Federal Center SEC. 1200.617. WARD 6 PUBLIC FACILITIES a) There are a substantial number of public facilities located in Ward 6, particularly in the west end of the ward. These include such federal facilities as the Capitol of the United States on the western edge, the Navy Yard on the southern edge, Anacostia Park on both sides of the river, the Stadium/Armory complex, containing not only the Stadium/Armory but D.C. General Hospital, the jail, and the building of the new prison. Also there is Capitol Hill Hospital at 7th and Constitution Avenue, N.E Union Station in near Northeast and numerous D.C. public schools. In addition, there are numerous Community-Based Residential Treatment Facilities CBRFs) throughout the ward, as well as number of large public housing projects: Ellen Wilson, Potomac Gardens, Kentucky Courts and Woodland Terrace. On the southern edge of the ward along M Street, S.E are several other public housing projects: The Arthur Capper dwellings, Carrollsburg and Hopkins b) In order to deal with impact of these facilities each should have some planning for their future development. The Architect of the Capitol has developed a Master Plan for the Capitol of the United States which could be a model for planning. The Navy Yard requires an updated master plan which would be overseen by the National Capital Planning Commission. As Union Station develops, there is planning for its traffic impact on the residential areas. Capitol Hill Hospital should have a master plan for its activities. The District government requires a number of plans: for the area encompassed by D.C. General Hospital, the jail, the 158 nrdlie O Islnai prisons and the Stadium/Armory. It should also have a plan for its numerous public housing projects which occupy many squares in the area. The school system requires a master plan for the disposition and reuse of its underutilized or abandoned schools. And finally, the District government needs to plan for the equitable disbursement of its CBRFs so that there is minimal impact on residential neighborhoods, not only of Ward 6, but throughout the District, except that the disbursement shall not violate the Fair Housing Amendments Act, approved March 12, 1989 (102 Stat. 1619; 42 U.S.C. 3601 et seq Fair Housing Act For the purposes of this subsection, the term ’handicap’ has the same meaning as in section 802(h) of the Fair Housing Act (42 U.S.C. 3602(h SEC. 1200.618.

WARD 6 URBAN DESIGN a) Ward 6 has a number of unique features which fix its character for any urban design planning Of special note are the large historic districts in the~Ward: the Capitol Hill Historic District on the west side and the Union Town Historic District in Old Anacostia. Since these constitute 40~ of the ward’s land, and the surrounding areas resemble them in physical appearance, it is their character which is a determinate of urban design for the ward. Most of the urban design issues consist of developing detailed streetscape designs for public spaces: sidewalk materials, lighting, signage, benches, plantings, fencing, trash containers, controls over placement of vending machines and trash containers in the public spaces by private persons, as well as controls on curb cuts and enhancements of the street tree program b) On the west side of the ward special attention needs to be given to the following area. In,conjunction with the National Park Service, a streetscape plan needs to be performed and implemented for Pennsylvania Avenue, S.E to Barney Circle. The Park Service is responsible for the Esplanade. The District is responsible for the sidewalks, lighting and street trees. At Pennsylvania Avenue and the Eastern Market Metro Stop there needs to be an extension of the Avenue streetscape into 7th Street to North Carolina Avenue down to 8th Street, S.E to the Navy Yard in order to establish the visual character of that area as the central business district of Capitol Hill. The center piece 161 of this consists of the re-design of the Eastern Market Metro Park to provide for more shade, better lighting, different landscaping, etc all appropriate for a Victorian neighborhood. A similar design issue exists at the Potomac Avenue Metro stop, which should be made part of the small area study for that neighborhood. Finally, there should be a major design study for the Barney Circle entry way at the point where the Avenue starts east over the Anacostia River. There may also be merit in extending Pennsylvania Avenue streetscape design all the way out to the Maryland line but on a less grand scale in order to delineate Barney Circle as the major entry to the U.S. Capitol c) Also on the western end of the ward, there needs to be an implementation of the "transition zone" mentioned in the Architect for the Capitol’s master plan for the U.S. Capitol. An appropriate streetscape would denote the point at which the private and district lines meet the edges of the Capitol Grounds. That should be accomplished in conjunction with the Architect of the Capitol d) Whenever the District and the Park Service have joint responsibility for parks large and small in the ward, there should a coordinated plan for fencing, lighting, walkways, and, most important, a security and maintenance plan for each park. These areas add considerably to the character of the areas and are vital to any meaningful plan for urban design of Ward 6 e) Finally, on the west end of the ward, a distinctive streetscape plan is necessary to establish the character and undergrid the viability of the H Street commercial corridor f) A similarly detailed streetscape plan for Old Anacostia is needed to assist in implementation of the Anacostia Coordinating Council’s plan for that area. As with the Capitol Hill Historic District, the Union Town Historic District should be the core around which a streetscape is designed g) The Twining/Greenway area requires a streetscape appropriate to its character in order to held it retain its character as a single family residence area. This area also requires buffering from the rail tracks and rail yard on its western side. Finally, Interstate 295 (Kenilworth Avenue) needs to have an urban design scheme to buffer it from the adjacent neighborhoods and also to give those who use the road a better impression of the urban areas through which they are passing SEC. 1200.622. WARD 6 OBJECTIVES FOR URBAN DESIGN. The objectives for urban design are as follows I) To acknowledge and protect the unique architectural character of Ward 6 and preserve the 162 ¯ urolled Origlnel continuity of the well established, essential and historic areas 2) To ensure that new development that occurs in Ward 6 complements and translates land uses into compatible, physical settings and preserves and enhances the outstanding qualities of the natural park areas 3) To encourage a high quality of architecture consistent with the styles and characteristics of buildings in Ward 6 SEC. 1200.623. WARD 6 POLICIES IN SUPPORT OF URBAN DESIGN OBJECTIVES The policies in support of urban design objectives are as follows I) Ensure that redeveloped and new structures in Ward 6 commercial corridors strengthen the urban design image of those areas and relate to adjacent residential neighborhoods 2) Install appropriately designed signs and markers to identify the designated historic districts in Ward 6 3) Find ways to enhance the environment surrounding Eastern Market and to reinforce the key elements of the L’Enfant Plan in Ward 6 West in future development activities 4) Provide streetscape improvements, trees, signs, lights and other such elements to enhance the environment in Ward 6 5) Continue to improve the design and unkeep of public spaces, including streets, sidewalks small open spaces and large formal squares in Ward 6 SEC. 1200.624. WARD 6 ACTIONS TO IMPLEMENT THE PLAN: URBAN DESIGN The actions to implement urban design are as follows I) Adopt and apply streetscape and aesthetic standards and controls for U.S. Capitol Master Plan-designated transition zone between the Capitol grounds and adjacent residential areas in conjunction with local community 2) Develop comprehensive streetscape design standards and controls for the Capitol Hill Historic District 3) Develop streetscape controls for Massachusetts Avenue corridor; specific attention to curtailment and regulation of sidewalk cafes, especially "enclosed" sidewalk cafes 4) Protect the historic character of Pennsylvania Avenue corridor, S.E. and enhance image and use 163 of avenue as ceremonial gateway to the U.S. Capitol through special streetscape controls and design standards 5) Develop special streetscape Controls and design standards for Pennsylvania Avenue corridor, including Seward Square area, with objective of integrating the two commercial streets radiating from the square i(7th Street, S.E. to the North and 8th Street, S.E. to the south 6) Continue National Park Servi~e jurisdiction in Lincoln Park 7) Preserve special character of East Capitol Street 8) Provide landscaping and scre4ning to mitigate adverse appearance of sprawling par~ing lots at stadium and sininster presence of the jail 9) Establish strict design controls of commercial signage, awnings, street furnitur4 and trash receptacles I0) Improve small park areas along Pennsylvania Avenue and adjacent commercial corridors through special landscaping, lighting, street furniture. Improvements to encompass park/plaza in 800 block of D Street, S.E south of Pennsylvania Avenue ii) Establish streetscape designlstandards and controls for Good Hope Road and Minnesota Avenue, S.E. to protect residential and historic qualities of thoroughfares SEC. 1200.625. WARD 6 PRESERVATION AND HISTORIC FEATURES a) Historic preservation is a dominant issue in Ward 6. Nearly 40~ of the ward’s land area zs in,the hlstorzc districts. The Capitol Hill Historic Distri6t is the largest historic district on the National Register of Historic Sites and Places with nearly 8,000 structures. The Anacostia Historic District encompasses approximately 25 blocks surrounding the Frederick Douglass HoUse, a national landmark. In addition to the Historic Districts, there are a number of historic sites in and around theihistoric areas. The Capitol Hill Historic District contains ~uch specifically designated sites as the EasternlMarket, Marine Barracks, Pennsylvania Avenue, S.E Women’s!Party House, Friendship House (the Maples) and immediately adjacent, the Capitol of the United States, Supreme Court And Library of Congress. On the south of the Capitol Hill Historic District is the Navy Yard and on the near northeast, Union Station. The Capitol Hill Historic Districtlis characterized by ~eing developed along the L~Enfant street plan for the old city of Washington and poss4sses an extensive alley system and large inner court~ which add to the light and air of the area. Finally, the~e is an entire square block just outside the District, the Old Car Barn, which is a specifically designated landmark Adjacent to 164 the Anacostia River is the 25-acre Congressional Cemetery, also a specifically designated landmark b) Uniontown in Old Anacostia consists of numerous wooden buildings and dwellings which date from the mid-to-late 19th century and constitute what was once a discrete village located within what was largely farmland at the time of its development. There is also a specifically designated landmark, Cedar Hill, the former home of abolitionist Frederick Douglass. Cedar Hill is maintained by the National Park Service and open to visitors c) There are substantial protections~which attach to these historic districts and specifically designated landmarks. All additions, alterations, demolitions, and new construction must go before the local PreserVation review Board. In addition, the District is supposed to protect against demolition by neglect and bar any demolition without a hearing SEC. 1200.626. WARD 6 OBJECTIVES FOR PRESERVATION AND HISTORIC FEATURES The objectives for the preservation and historic features are as follows I) To develop programs and activities that recognize and promote the valuable historic resources in Ward 6 and to increase awareness of and access to those facilities, activities and places 2) To protect and preserve the historic character of the residential neighborhoods in the Capitol Hill and Old Anacostia Historic District, in61uding Congressional Cemetery 3) To encourage new development and renovations of structures that are sensitive to the character of the historic districts in Ward 6 To monitor the use, modifications, and proposed demolitions of buildings to ensure preservation and compatibility with historic districts in the’Ward 6 area SEC. 1200.627. WARD 6 POLICIES IN SUPPORT OF PRESERVATION AND HISTORIC FEATURES OBJECTIVES The policies in support of preservation and historic feature objectives are as follows I) Support changes in regulations to ensure that development in Capitol Hill and Old Anacostia Historic Districts are compatible with the character of each Historic District 2) Encourage new development to!respect the character of adjacent landmarks through appropriate use of materials, building scale, and architecturalldesign. 165 3) Provide assistance in the Ward 6 area to property owners in the historic districts to encourage rehabilitation SEC. 1201.628. WARD 6 ACTIONS TO IMPLEMENT THE PLAN: PRESERVATION ANDHISTORIC FEATURES I) Monitor and enforce stringently rehabilitation, new construction and public space uses to assure compliance with historic district guidelines 2) The District government in maintaining and refurbishing and constructing in the Historic Districts will follow the same standards and guidelines as private persons 3) Develop assistance techniques to help lower income persons to remain in the Districts and to assist them in maintaining their property in accordance with historic district guidelines and standards 4) The Preservation Office will develop educational programs and materials to help educate the residents of historic districts as the meaning and reasons for the existence of such districts and what~their obligations are as residents of such districts 5) Prohibit unpermitted demolitions and exterior alterations in the Capitol Hill and Old Anacostia Historic Districts 6) Protect and preserve historic features, scale, and texture of Pennsylvania Avenue and adjacent commercial areas--prohibit unpermitted alterations, demolitions and incompatible new construction 7) Preserve historic character Of Eastern Market and adjacent areas 8) Extend Capitol Hill Historic District eastward to L’Enfant Plaza boundaries 9) Preserve and enhance historic character of East Capitol Street I0) Preserve historic row dwellings (Nos. 1-5 Barney Circle ii) Enhance historic scale and character of 8th Street, S.E and its linkage to Pennsylvania Avenue corridor through special streetscape controls and standards 12) Improve small park areas along Pennsylvania Avenue and adjacent commercial corridors through special landscaping, lighting, street furniture.

WARD 6 HUMAN SERVICES a) The change in the ward’s demographic patterns has shifted demands for human services. As Capitol Hill and Stanton park were renovated, social workers noted a significant decrease in the number of people!on welfare and reliance upon assistance in these areas. Still, segments of the ward’s population remain in need of the District’s social, economic and health support systems b) Ward 6 east of the Anacostia River has a high unemployment rate, low overall educational attainment level, high percentage of low- and moderate-income Single parent households, and a growing number of Community Based Residential Facilities CBRFs They provide vital services for those persons with disabilities~ the homeless, and those in need of substance-abuse treatment. Placement of CBRFs has been a controversial and sensitive issue for Ward 6. Each of these factors underlies the!need to improve the effectiveness of the ward’s human services delivery system c) District of Columbia General Hospital, the city’s only public health facility, and Capitol Hill Hospital, a privately-owned medical facility almost in the center of the Capitol Hill area, provide medical and health education services for residents of Ward 6 and through6ut the District. The District of Columbia General ~ospital is the only city owned and operated acute care and 4mergency treatment hospital. It serves all city residents, regardless of their ability to pay for treatment. The hospital is governed by a board of directors and is administered by an executive director d) The 26-building complex has 1.5 million square feet of floor area. The hospital is part of a 65-acre tract that also includes Department of Human Services and Department of Corrections buildings. Constr~cted in the 1930’s, the hospital was first renovated during the mid-1960s e) CBRF’s are an important element of the human services delivery system. They provide housing for a number of individuals and families in need of various types of public assistance f) A new Forensic Treatment Facilityiis planned to be constructed at 19th and D Streets, S.E. The proposed treatment center and CBRFs have been the center of controversy throughout the ward. Residents have expressed concern that these facilities lower propertylvalue and pose threats to public safety. 167 g) Other problems in the ward include an increase in teenage pregnancies, infant mortality, and drug and alcohol abuse SEC. 1200.630. WARD 6 OBJECTIVES FOR HUMAN~SERVICES The objectives for human services are as follows I) To provide effective physical and mental health care services throughout the ward 2) To improve public safety and increase the perception of safety in Ward 6 3) To continue to provide a comprehensive network of public and private health services to meet the needs of residents in Ward 6 SEC. 1200.631. WARD 6 POLICIES IN SUPPORT OF HUMAN SERVICES The policies in support of human services are as follows I) Inventory social services and their providers which operate in the Ward 6 community to identify any gaps in service delivery 2) Maintain concentrated crime reduction programs throughout Ward 6 3) Find ways to expand health and social services to those in need throughout Ward 6, with particular attention focused on the homeless, ho1~eholds headed by women, and the elderly 4) Distribute public information and fact sheets on public safety services available in the Ward 6 community to local businesses, residents, and tourists 5) Support the District of Columbia General Hospital and the Capitol Hill Hospital located in Ward 6 SEC. 1200.632. WARD 6 ACTIONS TO IMPLEMENT THE PLAN: HUMAN SERVICES The actions to implement the human services objectives are as follows i) Ensure that Congressionally-sponsored service institutions are compatible with the character of the immediately surrounding neighborhood 2) Retain and preserve Friendship House and Southeast House as neighborhood social services component 3) Develop joint public/private community human service center, including job information and placement and recreational facilities at an appropriate central H Street, N.E. site, as identified in re-evaulated H Street Corridor Urban Renewal Plan 4) Prevent further concentration of community-based residential facilities CBRF’s in Ward 6 neighborhoods and require future development of the CBRF’s 168 to be in accordance with the District-wide CBRF plan, except that efforts to prevent further concentration of community-based residential facilities shall not violate the Fair Housing Amendments Act, approved March 12, 1989 (102 Stat. 1619; 42 U.S.C. 3601 et seq Fair Housing Act For the purposes of this paragraph, the term ’handicap’ has the same meaning as in section 802(h) of theiFair Housing Act (42 U.S.C. 3602(h 5) Develop senior citizen community center in northeast section of the ward 6) Support Boys/Girls Club at 17th Street/Massachusetts Avenue, S.E. and make more accessible to neighborhood 7) Relocate Capitol Hill Day Care Center from Massachusetts Avenue/2nd Street, N.E. corner!to more appropriate new location 8) Maintain the "Therapeutic and Handicapped Center" at 3030 G Street, S.E. and the valuable human services it provides to the community 9) Improve police protection of~Hope Village, a combined adult-offender drug rehabilitation facility in Woodland subarea SEC. 1200.633. WARD 6 LAND USE a) Ward 6 is characterized by predom~nately moderate-density residential and low-density!commercial land use. Almost all commercial activity consists of small businesses supplying services to the surrounding community. Recently there has been reuse of many commercial buildings and the construction of new buildings to fur~ish offices for national associations and other groups servicing their needs. There is little developable vacant property. Most development opportunities are for infill structures, both commercial and residential b) Much of the ward’s distinctive physical character is bestowed by the existence of two large historic districts, which together occupy 40 percent of the ward’s land. The Capitol Hill Historic District is comprised of a large number of brick row houses and commercial structures dating from 1850 to 1915. There are some 8,000 such buildings. This district is distinguished also by the L’Enfant street plan and an extensive alley System. Within the Capitol Hill Historic District residential uses are almost exclusively row houses with scatteredlsmall apartment houses. There also has been conversion of some schools and churches to condominiums. Under current zoning each row house is entitled to be used for two units or flats. Most residents find that the right to live in one,part of the house while permitting a rental unit in an English basement 169 provides both sufficient density and the ability to support house payments c) Other concerns in protecting the integrity of the row houses in residential neighborhoods in W~rd 6 are overly permissive definitions of home occupations which would permit the expansion of offices in the residential areas. Other concerns affecting the residential districts are the development of alley lots into multi-family housing at density levels that change the neighborhood and without regard to issues of light and air d) Similar, but more varied, conditions exist in the residential areas on the east side of the wa@d (east of the Anacostia River In Old Anacostia, in the Uniontown Historic District there are some row houses but also numerous small, detached wooden structures Interspersed are a number of 1950’s apartment houses that are a discordant note to the uniformity of the historic district. There are also a series of neighborhoods such as Twining/Greenwood that are largely single-family detached but include a number of apartment houses which appear to have been permitted without appropriate consideration of the impact on the neighborhood. These neighborhoods require careful consideration of any additional non single-family usage in order to preserve and enhance these’areas e) The commercial districts of the ward largely serve the surrounding residential neighborhood with some areas close to the Capitol serving a large dlytime population. On the west end of the ward there is an urgent need that many portions of the commercial ar4as be closely studied to take into consideration the character and constraints of the Historic District and at the same time permit reasonable development. In this regard, some special attention has already been given through the Capital Interest Outlay Zone, which covers the historic district from the Capitol to 6th Street, S.E. and N.E. This restricts both uses and height of buildings. Much of the commercial district encompassed by that zone, including the 200 and 300 blocks of Pennsylvania Avenue, S.E. and Massachusetts Avenue up to the east end of Stanton Park, N.E. serve populations working in the Capitol and within the historic district. Further out on Pennsglvania Avenue, S.E. there is a node of commercial activity focused on the Eastern Market Metro Stop and park. This includes the 600 block of Pennsylvania Avenue, 7th Street, S.E. from the Avenue to North Carolina Avenue, and include~ Eastern Market and Pennsylvania Avenue down 8th Street, S.E. to the Navy Yard, a commercial area called Barracks Row f) From 9th Street on Pennsylvania Avenue to Barney Circle, there is an opportunity through careful planning and special streetscape to convert this portion 6f historic 170 Pennsylvania Avenue into an attractive area which will attract substantial investment. Unfortunately, much of the land use is now devoted to service stations and fast-food restaurants g) The H Street corridor is still rebuilding from the disturbances of 1968. However, there are a number of positive actions which are stimulating rebuilding. First, there is a long-standing Urban renewal Plan for the corridor which has been implemented through a number of D.C. government investments and land assemblages. Equally important to the street’s revitalization as in important shopping area has been the development of the Hechinger Mall which is still under expansion and is helping to stimulate development in the adjacent Benning Road area. Another development of somewhat more upscale character is the development of Union Station and environs for a large shopping mall and office buildings. That is affecting development in the nearby H Street corridor. And the continuing revitalization of the Capitol Hill Historic District will help support even more business development along H Street, N.E h) On the east side of the ward, the major portion of the business district has been largely planned as a result of the efforts of the Anacostia Coordinating Committee ACC The plan has been accepted by the local ANC and public officials and needs the assistance of the appropriate District agencies to make it a reality. Not only is the ACC plan finished and ready for implementation but the Green Line Metro station on the Plan’~s edge in Ward 8 will soon be open and there is revitalization of the Union Town Historic District within which sits the commercial area, which will also help support the implementation of the ACC plan i) Although the residential areas on the west side of the ward seem relatively stable, they are quite fragile because of density, traffic and crime. Therefore, in order to preserve and enhance these areas and to retain owner-occupants in these areas as well as to encourage stable family life, these issues need to be addressed. The continuing pressure for commercial and office use within these neighborhoods needs to be resisted. Because of the large number of under-utilized or empty schools in the west end of the ward, the School Board should be required to utilize these facilities for non-school use in conformance with the area’s predominant land use. Conversion of institutional buildings such as schools, warehouses, and churches for residential use a common practice in this area should be at a conforming density level j) A significant support to the stable residential neighborhoods is the availability of recreational spaces for 171 both passive and active uses. In this regard, there is little large-scale space available on the west side of the ward. There are numerous small parks scattered throughout the area with a few benches and small childr4n’s play apparatus, such as Turtle Park at the intersection of North Carolina Avenue, S.E. and Independence Avenue, S.E. Careful maintenance of these parks is important. La@ger parks include Lincoln, Stanton, etc which are important green spaces but do not provide active recreation ireas. Some of that is provided in school yards. But the major recreational park in the ward is the Anacostia River and its accompanying river front park system k) Anacostia Park is under the jurisdiction of the Park Service and intended to be a regional facility. However, it also serves as the major recreational area for Ward 6. The recreational aspects of the park are particularly well developed on the east sidelwith tennis courts, ball fields, picnic areas, fishing off the sea wall, a swimming pool and a structure to shelter outdoor entertainment. In addition, beyond the Conrail tracks north, there is an undeveloped area which has an abundance of wild life, including numerous varieties of birds. That portion needs maintenance and some greater accessibility which will come as part of the Barney Circle project, but retain its undeveloped character i) West Anacostia Park lacks a coherent plan for use. It now contains a variety of non-park uses including the D.C. Stadium and its parking lots, D.C. general Hospital, the jail, a new prison, the Swirl facility for treating discharges into the Anacostia, Congressional Cemetery, and a proposed roadway off East Capitol Street and the bridge linkage to the Southeast Freeway. Despite these problems, planning for the Barney Circle Freeway provides for such amenities as a number of playing fields and turnoffs from the roadway to permit fuller use of the river banks. After years of failed attempts to create a significant development a Children’s Island, most citizens now want a low level of recreational intensity on the island. As the Anacostia becomes cleaner, it becomes more available for recreational use. Several school groups are now working on the development of row competitions and it can be used for sculling and canoeing. Larger boat clubs line the banks between the Pennsylvania AvenUe bridge and the Navy Yard. The organization of the west bank of the Anacostia for boating activities of various types seems to be a trend and should be studied in order to,have a compatible relationship among the various uses SEC. 1200.63 WARD 6 OBJECTIVES FOR LAND USE The objectives for land use are as follows: 172 I) To maintain the general level of the existing Ward 6 residential uses, densities and heights, and to improve the physical condition of Ward 6 through the provision of functional, efficient and attractive residential, commercial and open space areas 2) To minimize conflicts between the various land uses in Ward 6 and to promote healthy residential environments through selective renewal, rehabilitation and neighborhood revitalization programs 3) To locate the more intensive and active land uses in areas of Ward 6 that, by virtue of existing and planned infrastructures, can accommodate and[support those types of uses and to monitor development and redevelopment adjacent to designated historic districts to,ensure compatibility SEC. 1200.635. WARD 6 POLICIES IN SUPPORT OF LAND USE OBJECTIVES The policies in support of land use objectives are as follows I) Stabilize and improve residential areas throughout Ward 6 2) Ensure that the integrity ofithe Capitol Hill and Old Anacostia Historic Districts that are located in Ward 6 is maintained 3) Monitor new developments to ensure that they are consistent with the moderate-density residential and low-density commercial character of Ward Six 4) Reduce the incompatible land uses in residential areas and neighborhoods and enforce regulatory tools to reduce the potential change in the overall character of the Ward 6 area 5) Fully implement the regulations of the Capitol Interest Districts and work with the Architect of the Capitol to ensure that the development of federal buildings in the future is compatible with adjacent residential areas located in Ward 6 SEC. 1200.636. WARD 6 ACTIONS TO IMPLEMENT THE PLAN: LAND USE The actions to implement the land use objectives are as follows I) Ensure that development of sites designated to accommodate future expansion of U.S. Capitol grounds is compatible with character of residential neighborhoods 2) Restrict development of available non-residential lots in Square 693 to uses that support the residential character and Capitol vista of New Jersey Avenue. 173 3) Limit development of the Providence Hospital site to its legal use as the prospective school for Congressional Pages or adapt the facility fo~ low- or medium-density residential or institutional ~se. Private development of facility must be subject to 16ng-term lease conditioned on compatibility with residentia~ area. Should be maintained if at all possible as open spa~e 4) Future use of former FDA building at Ist and E Streets, S.Eo by the Architect of the Capitol to be compatible with adjacent residential community. Density of use should not be increased 5) Protect the existing alley system and develop policy and plans for use of large block interior spaces. These plans shall be developed in coordination with the affected ANC 6) Control development near CaPitol South and Eastern Market Metro station areas to conform with existing and predominant uses and Ward 6 plan objectives and provisions. Future development of sites bordering Capitol South 1 (not controlled by Architect of the Capitol) to adhere to Architect’s Master Plan in providing chiefly residential setting for Capitol precinct. Development of commercial lots on Ist Street, S.E. to conform with Capitol Interest District standards 7) Direct development of medium,density office space near the U.S. House of Representatives to underutilized sites south of the Southeast/Southwest Freeway, east of South Capitol Street 8) Prevent commercial development of Kingman Island (Children’s Island) to avoid adverse 4ffects on neighborhoods; island and adjacent park areas to be improved for community and city-wide recreation use. It shall not be used for stadium or stadium-related purposes 9) Retain open-air Farmers’ Market at stadium I0) Designate area around Potomac Avenue Metro station as a Special Treatment Area. Bounda@ies of special study area are llth Street, S.E. on the westi(including the llth Street commercial corridor D Street, S.E. on the north, Kentucky Avenue on the east and Southeast/Southwest Freeway on the south. Special Treatment Area study to include development of underutilized commercial sites, e.g Bogan property at 14th and Potomac Avenue, S.E protection of residential properties and neighborhoods in the study area, including the residential neighborhoodlsouth of Pennsylvania Avenue bounded by 13th Street, S.E. on the west, Pennsylvania Avenue on the north, 15th~Street, S.E. on the east, and the Southeast/Southwest Freeway on the south. Special Treatment analysis to emphasize economic development potential in balance with predominately residential character of area. 174 II) Consider relocation of the WMATA Bus Barn to former Gas Work site in industrial area between Virginia Avenue~ llth Street, bridge and river.
