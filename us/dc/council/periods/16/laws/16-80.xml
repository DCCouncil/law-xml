    <search-text>ENROLLED ORIGINAL 1Codification District of Columbia Official Code, 2001 Edition West Group Publisher, 1-800-328-9378. AN ACT IN THE COUNCIL OF THE DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA To prohibit the transport of large shipments of certain extremely hazardous materials within 2.2 miles of the United States Capitol unless the transporter has obtained an authorizing permit, to provide for an exception to the permit requirement in cases of emergency, to authorize the District Department of Transportation to issue an authorizing permit upon a demonstration that there is no practical alternative route, and to require the Mayor to issue regulations to implement the provisions of this act. BE IT ENACTED BY THE COUNCIL OF THE DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA, That this act may be cited as the “Terrorism Prevention in Hazardous Materials Transportation Act of 2006”. Sec. 2. Findings. The Council of the District of Columbia finds that 1) A terrorist attack on a large-quantity hazardous material shipment near the United States Capitol (“Capitol”) would be expected to cause tens of thousands of deaths and a catastrophic economic impact of $5 billion or more 2) The threat of terrorism facing District of Columbia residents and workers in the vicinity of the Capitol requires an urgent response that recognizes and addresses the unique status of this area in American politics and history, and the risk of terrorism that results from this status 3) While the federal government has occupied the field of en route security and routing in the aviation context, it has not addressed the subject of rail car routing for security purposes. Moreover, the federal government has not acted to address the terrorist threat resulting from the transportation of ultra-hazardous materials within 2 miles of the Capitol, the White House, and the United States Supreme Court, unique terrorist targets 4) Shippers of ultra-hazardous materials do not need to route large quantities of ultra-hazardous chemicals near the Capitol in order to ship these chemicals to their destinations, and alternative routes would substantially decrease the aggregate risk posed by terrorist attacks 5) Requiring permits for ultra-hazardous shipments from a Capitol Exclusion Zone that encompasses all points within 2.2 miles of the Capitol would impose no significant burden on interstate commerce. Sec. 3. Definitions. For the purposes of this act, the term 1) “Capitol Exclusion Zone” means all points within 2.2 miles of the United States Capitol Building; provided, that the Capitol Exclusion Zone shall not extend beyond the geographic boundaries of the District of Columbia.
