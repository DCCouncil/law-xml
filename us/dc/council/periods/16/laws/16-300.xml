City 100 Washington, D.C. is one of the great cities of the world. It is the nation’s capital, a global center of knowledge and power, and the central city of one of America’s largest and most prosperous metropolitan areas. It is also our home—a city of great neighborhoods, a vibrant downtown, historic buildings, diverse shopping, renowned institutions, and magnificent parks and natural areas. 100.1 Our city bears the imprints of many past plans, each a reflection of the goals and visions of its era. The influence of these plans can be seen all around us—they affect the way we live and work, the way we travel, and the design of our communities. Planning is part of our heritage. It has shaped the District's identity for more than two centuries and has made us the place we are today. 100.2 The fact that we are a mature city does not mean it is time to stop planning and just let the future happen. In fact, the need for planning has never been greater than it is today. 100.3 The District is changing. At this moment, more housing is under construction in the District of Columbia than was built during the entire decade of the 1990s. Enough office space to replicate downtown Denver is on the drawing boards. Federal properties—some larger in land area than all of Georgetown or Anacostia—are being studied for new uses. These changes generate excitement and tension at the same time. Issues of race, class, and equity rise to the surface as the city grows. We strive to be a more “inclusive” city—to ensure that economic opportunities reach all of our residents, and to protect and conserve the things we value most about communities. 100.4 [SIDEBAR: “Growing inclusively means that individuals and families are not confined to particular economic and geographic boundaries but are able to make important choices—choices about where they live, how and where they earn a living, how they get around the city, and where their children go to school. Growing inclusively also means that every resident can make these choices—regardless of whether they have lived here for generations or moved here last week, and regardless of their race, 15 income, or age.” — A Vision for Growing An Inclusive City, 2004] As we think about our future, other issues arise. How will people get around the city in 20 years? Where will our children go to school? Will police and fire services be adequate? Will our rivers be clean? Will our air be healthy? How will we resolve the affordable housing crisis and ensure that housing choices are available for all residents? How can we ensure that District residents have access to the thousands of new jobs we are expecting? How will the character of our neighborhoods be conserved and improved? How will federal and local interests be balanced? 100.5 This Comprehensive Plan provides our response to these important questions and a framework to achieve our goals. 100.6 The Comprehensive Plan includes detailed maps and policies for the physical development of the District of Columbia. The Plan also addresses social and economic issues that affect and are linked to the development of the city and our citizens. It allows the community to predict and understand the course of future public actions and shape private sector investment and actions too. It allows the District to ensure CITYWIDE ELEMENTS COM PREHENSIVE PLAN D ISTRICT ELEM ENTS ADOPTED 12/19/06 P. 1-2 that its resources are used wisely and efficiently and that public investment is focused in the areas where it is needed most. 100.7 The Comprehensive Plan provides guidance on the choices necessary to make the District a better city. No single person or organization is in a position to make these decisions alone. Many residents, governmental agencies, businesses, institutions, and leaders have helped shape this plan. Their continued commitment will be needed to carry it out in the coming years. 100.8 [START TEXTBOX] Planning in the District -Then And Now Washington, D.C. is widely known as a city steeped in American history. This reputation extends to city planning too, and starts with the very origin of the District of Columbia in 1791. 100.9 More than two centuries ago, George Washington commissioned Pierre L’Enfant to plan a new national capital on the banks of the Potomac and Anacostia Rivers. L’Enfant and surveyor Benjamin Banneker designed Washington’s unique diagonal and grid system and sited some of America’s most important landmarks, including the U.S. Capitol and the White House. 100.10 A century later, the US Congress asked the McMillan Commission to transform Washington into a world class capital city. The Commission responded with a grand plan to beautify the District with the National Mall, many neighborhood parks, and an expanded Rock Creek Park. 100.11 Today, the L’Enfant and McMillan Plans are regarded as major milestones in Washington’s history. The plans of the mid- to late- 20th century are less celebrated, but are no less important. In 1924, federal legislation created the National Capital Park and Planning Commission. Its initial focus was on city parks and playgrounds but soon expanded to include land use, transportation, and public facilities. The Commission produced a Comprehensive Plan in 1950, another in 1961, and another in 1967. These plans proposed radical changes to the city’s landscape, including freeways and “urban renewal.” 16 The mid-century Comprehensive Plans were largely driven by federal interests and a desire to retain the beauty and functionality of Washington as a capital city. 100.12 In 1973, the federal Home Rule Act designated the Mayor of the District of Columbia as the city’s principal planner. The Comprehensive Plan was divided into “District” Elements to be prepared by the District’s Office of Planning, and “Federal” Elements to be prepared by the National Capital Planning Commission (NCPC The first Comprehensive Plan of the post-Home Rule era, containing both District and Federal Elements, was completed in 1984. 100.13 Between 1984 and 2005, the District Elements were amended four times. A 1985 amendment added the Land Use Element and Maps. The 1989 and 1994 amendments added Ward Plans to the document, roughly tripling its size. The 1998 amendments included a variety of map and text changes to reflect then-current conditions. A new version of the Federal Elements, meanwhile, was prepared by NCPC in the early 2000s and approved in 2004. 100.14 During the past six years, the District has moved into a new era of urban planning, headlined by neighborhood plans, corridor studies, the Anacostia Waterfront Initiative, and the citywide Vision for Growing an Inclusive City. The Vision is emblematic of a new philosophy about planning in the city, which has been carried forward into this Comprehensive Plan. The plan’s overriding emphasis is on improving the quality of life for current and future residents of the District of Columbia. 100.15 CITYWIDE ELEMENTS COM PREHENSIVE PLAN D ISTRICT ELEM ENTS ADOPTED 12/19/06 P. 1-3 [END TEXTBOX] [START Sidebar] A Revised Plan is Needed From 1985 to 2005, land use decisions in the District were governed by a Comprehensive Plan drafted in the early 1980s. By the early 2000s, it was becoming clear that the Comp Plan was out of date. The “future”—as envisioned by the Plan—was already history. 102.6 In 2003, a Citizens’ Task Force, appointed by the Mayor and DC Council, completed an assessment of the existing Plan. As a result of the assessment, the Office of Planning recommended that the Comprehensive Plan be thoroughly revised, not just amended. The Task Force concluded that the plan was outdated, difficult to read and understand, lacked maps and graphics, and did not provide the direction needed to address the tough issues facing our city today. 102.7 Based on this assessment, the Mayor and Council agreed to move ahead with a major revision of the Comprehensive Plan, rather than starting another round of piecemeal amendments. It was time for an indepth analysis of existing conditions and trends, and a fresh look at the city’s future. It was also time to reach out to thousands of DC residents to raise awareness of why the Comprehensive Plan is important to the city’s future and to the daily life of residents and businesses. The 2006 Comprehensive Plan is the response to that call. 102.8 [END Sidebar] The Comprehensive Plan’s Legal Basis, Role and Content 101 Legislative Foundation 102 The DC Code vests the Mayor with the authority to initiate, develop and submit a Comprehensive Plan to the DC Council, as well as the power to propose amendments following the plan’s adoption. In the course of adoption, the DC Council may alter the Comprehensive Plan, subject to the approval of the Mayor and review by the National Capital Planning Commission (NCPC) and Congress. 102.1 Because of the District’s role as the nation’s capital, the Comprehensive Plan includes two 17 components: the Federal Elements, which address federal lands and facilities, and the District Elements, which address all other lands. Together, these elements constitute the District’s mandated planning documents. 102.2 Section 1-301.62 of the DC Code states that t)he purposes of the District Elements of the Comprehensive Plan for the National Capital are to: 102.3 (a) Define the requirements and aspirations of District residents, and accordingly influence social, economic and physical development b) Guide executive and legislative decisions on matters affecting the District and its citizens c) Promote economic growth and jobs for District residents d) Guide private and public development in order to achieve District and community goals; CITYWIDE ELEMENTS COM PREHENSIVE PLAN D ISTRICT ELEM ENTS ADOPTED 12/19/06 P. 1-4 (e) Maintain and enhance the natural and architectural assets of the District; and (f) Assist in the conservation, stabilization, and improvement of each neighborhood and community in the District. The DC Code broadly defines the plan’s scope. Section 1-204.23 states that the Comprehensive Plan “may include land use elements, urban renewal and redevelopment elements, a multi-year program of municipal public works for the District, and physical, social, economic, transportation, and population elements.” 102.4 The Code also specifies that the land use element include “a generalized land use map or a series of maps representing the land use policies set forth in the Land Use Element.” 102.5 The Comprehensive Plan is not intended to be a substitute for more detailed plans nor dictate precisely what other plans must cover. Rather it is the one document that bridges all topics and is cross-cutting in its focus. It alone is the Plan that looks at the “big picture” of how change will be managed in the years ahead. The Family of Plans 103 The Comprehensive Plan can be thought of as the centerpiece of a “Family of Plans” that guide public policy in the District (See Figure 1.1 In the past, there has been a lack of clarity over the relationship between the Comprehensive Plan and the many other plans prepared by District agencies. This has reduced the Plan’s effectiveness and even resulted in internal inconsistencies between agency plans. 103.1 Under the DC Code, the Comprehensive Plan is the one plan that guides the District’s development, both broadly and in detail. Thus it carries special importance in that it provides overall direction and shapes all other physical plans that District government adopts. In fact, all plans relating to the city’s physical development should take their lead from the Comprehensive Plan, building on common goals and shared assumptions about the future. For example, the growth projections contained in the Comprehensive Plan should be incorporated by reference in other plans that rely on such forecasts. 103.2 As the guide for all District planning, the Comprehensive Plan establishes the priorities and key actions that other plans address in greater detail. The broad direction it provides may be implemented through agency strategic plans, operational plans, long-range plans on specific topics (such as parks or housing and focused plans for small areas of the city. 103.3 18 The Comprehensive Plan is not intended to be a substitute for more detailed plans nor dictate precisely what other plans must cover. Rather it is the one document that bridges all topics and is cross-cutting in its focus. It alone is the Plan that looks at the “big picture” of how change will be managed in the years ahead. 103.4 Where appropriate, this Comprehensive Plan includes cross-references and text boxes to highlight other documents in the “Family of Plans.” Some examples include the federally-mandated State Transportation Plan (known as the “Transportation Vision Plan” the Historic Preservation Plan, the Parks and Recreation Master Plan, and the Public Facilities Plan. Other agency plans may be guided by Comprehensive Plan policies but are outside of the city government’s direct control. These include the District of Columbia Public Schools Master Facilities Plan. 103.5 [INSERT Figure 1.1: The Family of Plans 103.6] CITYWIDE ELEMENTS COM PREHENSIVE PLAN D ISTRICT ELEM ENTS ADOPTED 12/19/06 P. 1-5 The Three “Tiers” of Planning 104 Since the late 1980s, the District has maintained a three-tiered system of city planning comprised of a) Citywide policies (b) Ward-level policies (c) Small area policies 104.1 In the past, the Comprehensive Plan has been the repository for the citywide and ward-level policies. The small area policies, meanwhile, have appeared in separately bound “Small Area Plans” for particular neighborhoods and business districts. As specified in the city’s municipal code, Small Area Plans provide supplemental guidance to the Comprehensive Plan and are not part of the legislatively adopted document. 104.2 The 2006 Comprehensive Plan retains three geographic tiers but incorporates a number of changes to improve the plan’s effectiveness and readability. Probably the most important change is the replacement of “Ward Plans” with “Area Elements.” While Ward Plans were an effective way to express local priorities within the Comp Plan, the boundaries changed dramatically in 1990 and 2000 due to population shifts. Redistricting will occur again after the Censuses in 2010, 2020, and so on. Moreover, the city’s wards are drawn to ensure an equal number of residents in each Council district rather than to provide a coherent rationale for planning the city. Thus, places like Downtown Washington (divided by a ward boundary) and the Anacostia River (divided by four ward boundaries) have been covered in multiple places in past Comprehensive Plans. This has resulted in redundancy and fragmented policies for many of Washington’s most important places. The relationship between the Comprehensive Plan and the three tiers is described below. 104.3 [PULLQUOTE: The Comprehensive Plan includes 10 Area Elements, which together encompass the entire District. Area Elements focus on issues unique to that part of the city.] Tier One: The Citywide Elements The Comprehensive Plan includes 13 Citywide Elements, each addressing a topic that is citywide in scope, followed by an Implementation Element. The elements are listed below Framework (setting the plan’s guiding principles and vision Land Use Transportation Housing 19 Economic Development Parks, Recreation, and Open Space Educational Facilities Environmental Protection Infrastructure Urban Design Historic Preservation Community Services and Facilities Arts and Culture Implementation 104.4 CITYWIDE ELEMENTS COM PREHENSIVE PLAN D ISTRICT ELEM ENTS ADOPTED 12/19/06 P. 1-6 Many of the Area Element policies are place-based,” referencing specific neighborhoods, corridors, business districts, and local landmarks. However, the policies are still general in nature and do not prescribe specific uses or design details. Tier Two: The Area Elements The Comprehensive Plan includes 10 Area Elements, shown on Map 1.1. Taken together, these ten areas encompass the entire District of Columbia. The Area Elements are listed alphabetically below Capitol Hill Central Washington Far Northeast and Southeast Far Southeast and Southwest Lower Anacostia Waterfront and Near Southwest Mid-City Near Northwest Rock Creek East Rock Creek West Upper Northeast 104.5 Although the Citywide and Area Elements are in separate sections of this document, they carry the same legal authority. The Area Elements focus on issues that are unique to particular parts of the District. Many of their policies are “place-based,” referencing specific neighborhoods, corridors, business districts, and local landmarks. However, the policies are still general in nature and do not prescribe specific uses or design details. Nor do the Area Elements repeat policies that already appear in the citywide elements. They are intended to provide a sense of local priorities and to recognize the different dynamics at work in each part of the city. 104.6 Tier Three: The Small Area Plans As noted above, Small Area Plans are not part of the Comprehensive Plan. As specified in the DC Code, Small Area Plans supplement the Comprehensive Plan by providing detailed direction for areas ranging in size from a few city blocks to entire neighborhoods or corridors. In the past, Small Area Plans have been prepared for places in the city where District action was necessary to manage growth, promote revitalization, or achieve other long-range planning goals. Examples include the H Street NE corridor, the Takoma Metro station area, and the Shaw/Convention Center area. Small Area Plans are adopted by the DC Council by resolution. The Comprehensive Plan is adopted in a different manner by legislation and becomes part of the DC Municipal Regulations. 104.7 In the future, additional Small Area Plans will be developed. The Implementation Element of this Comprehensive Plan outlines where and under what conditions such plans should be undertaken. 20 Existing Small Area Plans are cross-referenced in the Comprehensive Plan Area Elements and should be consulted for further detail about the areas they cover. 104.8 [INSERT Map 1.1: Area Elements Map 104.9] The Implementation Element identifies priority actions — the actions that must and should be completed in the near term. The addition of this element is a major departure from past Comprehensive Plans for the District. It represents an important step forward in assuring accountability. CITYWIDE ELEMENTS COM PREHENSIVE PLAN D ISTRICT ELEM ENTS ADOPTED 12/19/06 P. 1-7 Moving from Plan to Action 105 This Comprehensive Plan also includes a chapter on plan implementation. The Implementation Element describes how the plan’s recommended actions are to be carried out and by which government agencies. Timeframes for implementation are also provided so that the plan’s implementation steps that can be measured and monitored. The addition of this element is a major departure from past Comprehensive Plans for the District. It represents an important step forward in assuring accountability. 105.1 Of course, an implementation element alone is no guarantee that the policies of this Comprehensive Plan will be followed or that its actions will be carried out. It is the job of the District administration to abide by the Comprehensive Plan and coordinate with other agencies of government to ensure that future actions respect its policies. The most important tools for doing this are zoning and coordination of capital improvement programming with the policies and actions set forth in the Comprehensive Plan. The use of these tools to carry out the Comprehensive Plan is described in the Implementation Element. 105.2 Comprehensive Plan Technical Appendices 106 Developing policies for the District’s future requires an extensive and detailed “baseline” of information about existing conditions and planning issues. It would be impossible to include all of that information within this document and still maintain its readability. Thus, a series of technical appendices has been assembled to supplement the Comprehensive Plan. These appendices include additional narrative text, data, and maps on transportation, infrastructure, the environment, and economic development in the city. The Technical Appendices should be consulted for further guidance and details on the topics covered in this Comprehensive Plan. 106.1 How This Plan Was Prepared 107 This Comprehensive Plan is the outcome of a four-year revision process. 107.1 In 2002, the Mayor and Council deferred the regularly-scheduled amendment of the District Elements and instead asked the Office of Planning to conduct a Comprehensive Plan assessment. A 29-member citizens task force was convened to advise the District as it evaluated changes that would improve the Comp Plan’s effectiveness, organization, and format. The Comprehensive Plan Assessment Report, issued in February 2003, recommended a major Plan revision and fundamental changes to the document’s structure. The report also suggested that the first step in the revision should be to develop a broad vision for the city’s future. 107.2 Community workshops were essential to the Plan revision. Three “rounds” of workshops were held, each 21 comprised of four to eight interactive meetings or gatherings. A Vision for Growing an Inclusive City was developed in response. The Vision included an appraisal of the District’s major planning issues and articulated goals for addressing these issues in the future. Its content was shaped by position papers on topics ranging from education to housing, workshops with department heads and civic leaders, and input from more than 3,000 District residents at the Mayor’s Citizens Summit in November 2003. The Vision was endorsed by the Council in June 2004. 107.3 Work on the Comprehensive Plan revision began in Fall 2004. With the Vision’s directive to “grow an inclusive city,” the revision was designed to be an “inclusive” process. The goal of this process was not merely to involve the public in creating the Plan—it was to build a constituency for the Plan to advocate CITYWIDE ELEMENTS COM PREHENSIVE PLAN D ISTRICT ELEM ENTS ADOPTED 12/19/06 P. 1-8 for more effective implementation in the future. Thus, education and outreach about the Plan became as important as public input. 107.4 This is the District’s first Comprehensive Plan prepared during the “digital” era and as such, a host of new tools were used to reach the community. The project website www.inclusivecity.org was used to publicize meetings, display information, provide drafts for comment, and receive feedback through bulletin boards and e-mail. The website received more than 1.3 million “hits” over the course of the project. Television and radio were also used, drawing residents to town meetings, workshops, and public hearings. 107.5 The Comprehensive Plan’s content was also shaped by a Plan Revision Task Force. The 28-member Task Force represented diverse interests and geographic areas, and advised the Office of Planning on the Comprehensive Plan’s content as well as its maps and place-specific recommendations. Similarly, an Interagency Working Group representing more than 20 District and federal agencies was convened throughout the process to provide policy feedback and technical assistance. Small Group Discussions, attended by stakeholders and others with a particular interest in plan topics, were convened on specific issues such as higher education and environmental quality. 107.6 Large community workshops were also essential to the Plan revision. Three “rounds” of workshops were held, each comprised of four to eight interactive meetings or gatherings. In all, the workshops drew more than 1,500 participants, with virtually every neighborhood of the city taking part. The workshops were supplemented by dozens of meetings with Advisory Neighborhood Commissions, Citizen and Civic Associations, interest groups, and individuals. 107.7 While public involvement was the “driver” behind the Plan’s content, its policies and actions have also been shaped by many other sources. Foremost among these is the prior Comprehensive Plan; many of its policies have been edited and carried forward. Similarly, recent plans and planning efforts, including the newly updated Federal Elements, also guide the Comprehensive Plan’s content. Finally, an enormous amount of data collection and analysis underpins the Plan’s recommendations. This data was largely absent from the prior plan, leading to findings and recommendations that were not always supported by fact. 107.8 This Comprehensive Plan was presented to the DC Council in the summer of 2006, with Council public hearings held in the fall. Revisions to the draft plan were made based on Council comments and 22 public testimony, and the document was adopted in December, 2006. 107.9 [PULLQUOTE: This Comprehensive Plan has been written to be an effective resource for those who seek general information on how the District may change over the next 20 years, as well as those who want or need to understand how the city plans to respond to particular issues and problems.] How to Use the Comprehensive Plan 108 This document has been designed for use by elected officials, District government, residents, businesses and developers, and others with an interest in the future of the District of Columbia. The fact that so many different users will consult the Comprehensive Plan shapes the way information is presented. Although it is a legal document, the Comprehensive Plan has been written in “plain English” to make it more accessible. Key issues are described with data to make the purpose of policies more apparent. Graphics, maps, photos, and charts have been used to illustrate major points and improve the legibility of the text. Text boxes are used to present background information.

Crossreferences are used to direct the reader to other relevant and related policies and actions within the document. 108.1 This Comprehensive Plan has been written to be an effective resource for those who seek general information on how the District may change over the next 20 years, as well as those who want or need to understand how the city plans to respond to particular issues and problems. As the District’s primary planning document, the Comprehensive Plan is of particular interest to elected officials (who must adopt it and fund its implementation) as well as agency heads who must bring other plans in line with it. 108.2 The Comprehensive Plan’s Generalized Policy Map and Future Land Use Map are incorporated as part of the document and provide the foundation for land use decision-making and zoning. Both maps are described in detail in the Framework Element. These maps appear as poster-sized foldouts. They are supplemented by numerous smaller maps that appear throughout the text. 108.3 As the Comprehensive Plan is successfully implemented, it will have many far reaching effects on everyone who lives or works in the District. It will affect where development occurs; where green space, recreation facilities and parks are improved; and how neighborhoods are conserved and enhanced as desirable places to live. At the heart of the Comprehensive Plan are a series of goal, policy, and action statements Goals describe ideal future conditions for a particular topic such as housing or transportation. Following the Framework Element, each of the citywide elements begins with a single goal statement Policies provide guidance to the District as it makes decisions relating to each goal. This document contains hundreds of policies, each preceded by a title that indicates the subject being addressed Actions identify the specific steps to be taken by the District to implement the policies. These are prioritized and assigned to District agencies in the Implementation Element. 108.4 The policies and actions of the Comprehensive Plan are principally intended to guide the decisions of District government. Continuous and ongoing consultation with Advisory Neighborhood Commissions, residents, community organizations, businesses, institutions, and property owners is essential as these policies and actions are carried out. How Does This Plan Affect Me? 109 23 The Comprehensive Plan is relevant to most people’s daily lives and interests since it directs how and where change and development will occur. As the Comprehensive Plan is successfully implemented, it will have many far reaching effects on everyone who lives or works in the District. It will affect where development occurs; where green space, recreation facilities and parks are improved; and how neighborhoods are conserved and enhanced as desirable places to live. The Comprehensive Plan affects everyone, not just public employees, developers and property owners. 109.1 CITYWIDE ELEMENTS COMPREHENSIVE PLAN DISTRICT ELEMENTS ADOPTED 12/19/06 P. 1-10 CHAPTER 2 FRAMEWORK ELEMENT Overview 200 The Framework Element of the Comprehensive Plan serves four purposes. 200.1 First, it provides the context for the rest of the Plan by describing the forces driving change in the city. These forces include demographic shifts, economic change, technological change, fiscal challenges, tensions between federal and local interests, and more. Such “driving forces” define the major issues facing Washington and touch every aspect of life in the city. 200.2 Second, the Element includes a description of the District’s growth forecasts and projections. The forecasts are expressed in narrative format and are also summarized in tables and charts. They show how and where the District expects to add households, people, and jobs between 2005 and 2025. 200.3 Third, the Framework Element ties the Comprehensive Plan to Vision for Growing an Inclusive City. It lays out 36 principles to be followed as the District moves from “Vision to Reality.” These principles, largely drawn from the Vision and from the previous Comprehensive Plan, express cross-cutting goals for the District’s future that guide the Plan’s policies and actions. 200.4 Finally, the Element describes the Comprehensive Plan Policy Map and the Future Land Use Map. The Policy Map “tells the story” of how the District is expected to change during the next two decades. It highlights the places where much of the city’s future growth and change is expected to occur and sets the stage for the Elements that follow. The Future Land Use Map shows the general character and distribution of recommended and planned uses across the city. Both maps carry the same legal weight as the text of the Comprehensive Plan. 200.5 Unlike the other Citywide Elements, this Element does not contain policies and actions. Its intent is to provide the foundation for the rest of the Comprehensive Plan. 200.6 2.1 The Forces Driving Change 201 The sections below describe the forces driving change in the District of Columbia and outline the implications of these forces for the District's future. 201.1 2.1.1 The District and the Region 202 Between 1980 and 2005, the Washington metropolitan area grew by almost 50 percent, increasing from 3.4 million to 5.0 million residents. More than 1.2 million jobs were added during this period, an increase of almost 70 percent. This type of growth might not be surprising in a sunbelt city like Houston or Los Angeles, but in the urban northeast, the statistics are truly impressive. Greater Washington is the fastest 24 growing large metropolitan area in the country outside of the South and West. This growth has been accompanied by unprecedented urban sprawl—the region has actually become less dense as it has added people and jobs. Metropolitan Washington now sprawls across 4,000 square miles of the Middle Atlantic States. 202.1 CITYWIDE ELEMENTS COMPREHENSIVE PLAN DISTRICT ELEMENTS ADOPTED 12/19/06 P. 1-11 [PULLQUOTE: Greater Washington is the fastest growing large metropolitan area in the country outside of the South and West. This growth has been accompanied by unprecedented urban sprawl—the region has actually become less dense as it has added people and jobs.] Growth has changed the District’s role within the region. In 1950, the District had 46 percent of the region’s population and 83 percent of its jobs. By 2000, it had just 12 percent of the region’s population and 25 percent of its jobs. Given the city’s finite land area, this trend is expected to continue. Even the most ambitious projections show the District with a diminishing share of the region’s population and jobs in the future. 202.2 A declining share of population and jobs does not necessarily suggest a less important role, however. Our position as the nation’s capital, our historic and unique neighborhoods, and our cultural and urban amenities will keep the city vital. In fact, these attributes have already placed a premium on Washington as it has become more distinct from the vast and relatively new suburbs growing up around it. 202.3 There are warning signs that regional growth may be out of balance, however. The “inner ring” suburbs of Montgomery, Prince George’s, and Fairfax Counties are planning to add 620,000 jobs during the next 25 years but only 273,000 households. Similar imbalances appear in Arlington, Alexandria, and even in counties on the suburban fringe. If the region continues to grow this way, more workers will seek housing outside the region, creating more congestion, more sprawl, and more expensive housing in the region’s core. The jobs-housing imbalance may fuel demand for housing in the District as suburban residents seek to reduce their commuting times by moving closer to their jobs. However, the opposite may occur if jobs move further away and the workforce follows. 202.4 [INSERT Figure 2.1: Population change by Neighborhood Cluster, 1980-2000 203.7] 2.1.2 Demographic Changes 203 One of the most well documented trends to affect the District over the last five decades is the loss of population. In 1950, Washington had 802,000 residents and was the 9th largest city in America. By 2000, Washington’s population had dropped to 572,000 and it ranked 21st in size among U.S. cities. Between 1970 and 2000 alone, the number of people living in the District of Columbia dropped by almost 25 percent. 203.1 Population decline has affected different parts of the city in different ways. Figure 2.1 shows the population changes that occurred from 1980 to 2000 by neighborhood cluster. The vast majority of the decline has occurred in areas east of 16th Street. In fact, the area east of the Anacostia River lost 44,000 residents during the 1980s and 90s, while many areas west of Rock Creek Park actually gained residents. As middle-income households moved away, poorer residents were left behind, leaving the District with the largest concentration of poverty in the region and a sharper divide between rich and poor. This also resulted in a growing concentration of people with special needs, and patterns of disinvestment and 25 social ills in many communities. 203.2 Unlike the experience of other major cities, the loss of population in Washington was not the result of "white flight In fact, between 1980 and 2000, African-Americans registered the largest decrease among the city’s racial groups, dropping in population by almost 100,000. This drop was partially offset by increases in the city's Hispanic and Asian populations. 203.3 While population loss after 1950 was significant, the decline in the number of households has been much less dramatic. The number of households in the District declined by just 2 percent between 1980 and CITYWIDE ELEMENTS COMPREHENSIVE PLAN DISTRICT ELEMENTS ADOPTED 12/19/06 P. 1-12 2000, standing at 248,000 in 2000. Thus, population loss in the late 1900s was less a function of housing being abandoned and more a result of larger households being replaced by smaller households. In fact, the average household in Washington contained 2.16 persons in 2000, down from 2.72 in 1970. Middleclass families left the city in large numbers during this period and the number of school-aged children dropped dramatically. 203.5 Looking forward, the city expects household size to continue falling through 2010, and then stabilize. According to the US Census, the percentage of seniors is expected to increase as “baby-boomers” retire, and the percentage of foreign-born residents, particularly those of Hispanic origin, is expected to rise. The District is expected to continue to be a magnet for the region’s young professionals and empty nesters. Its ability to attract families with children rests largely on its ability to improve the quality of public education and address basic issues like crime, service provision, and housing affordability. 203.6 [Insert Series of Maps, showing 2000 Census data and DOES data] [Figure 2.2: Unemployment in 2002 204.6] [Figure 2.3: Persons 25 and Older Without College Degrees in 2000 204.7] [Figure 2.4: Poverty Rate in 2000 204.8] 2.1.3 Economic Changes 204 On the surface, Washington’s economic picture would appear to be the envy of most cities. There are more jobs than residents, and nearly three times more jobs than households. In 2005, there were some 740,000 jobs in the District, an increase of about 30,000 jobs since 2000. Wages in the region are among the highest in the nation. 204.1 With these statistics, one might assume that every District resident who is able to work is gainfully employed. Yet the city’s unemployment rate hovers between 6 and 9 percent and is consistently double the rate for the region as a whole. Many District residents do not have the skills to fill the white- collar jobs that drive the city’s economy. More than 70 percent of the jobs in the District are filled by workers who live in Maryland and Virginia. In fact, some “importing” of workers from the suburbs is essential to the District economy—even if every DC resident in the labor force was employed in the city, we would still need over 400,000 additional workers to fill the city’s jobs. 204.2 This imbalance causes a number of problems. The most often cited problem is the District’s inability to tax the incomes of the 500,000 non-residents who commute to the city each day. This daily migration is also accompanied by traffic congestion, air quality problems, and millions of hours of lost productivity. But perhaps the more profound problem is the regional income divide. As Figures 2.2, 2.3 and 2.4 26 indicate, the District today is a city divided by income, education, and employment. [INSERT FOOTNOTE: Figures 2.3, 2.4, and 2.5 and other demographic tables in this document are generally based on 2000 Census data. It should be noted that students residing in the District on April 1, 2000 (census day) are counted as residents of the District rather than residents of their home state. Consequently, data on poverty, age, and other variables may be skewed in census tracts containing (or adjacent to) universities. The District has accounted for these anomalies within the Comp Plan, and should tailor its anti-poverty, economic development, and similar programs accordingly.] Vision for Growing an Inclusive City concluded that bridging the income divide was the single biggest challenge facing the District as it planned for its future. 204.3 CITYWIDE ELEMENTS COMPREHENSIVE PLAN DISTRICT ELEMENTS ADOPTED 12/19/06 P. 1-13 From a regional perspective, the District’s employment outlook is positive. Because Washington is the seat of the federal government, it has been insulated from the economic cycles that have affected other regions of the country. The city never had a large industrial base, so it was spared the large-scale job losses experienced by places like Baltimore and Philadelphia during the 1970s and 1980s. It was not dependent on technology jobs, so it was spared the downturns affecting places like San Jose and Austin during the early 2000s. Even the downsizing of the federal government in the 1990s was accompanied by a rise in procurement spending that kept the Washington economy strong. 204.4 But a resilient economy alone does not close the "skills gap" that exists between the needs of local employers and the abilities of many District residents. Future job growth is expected to be concentrated in the services sector, including the business, legal, engineering, management, educational and social service fields. The Economic Development Element of this Plan emphasizes the importance of closing the skills gap by improving education and job training so that more District residents can fill jobs in these professions. 204.5 2.1.4 Land Use Changes 205 In terms of land area, Washington is not a large city. At 69 square miles, it is half the size of Denver or Philadelphia, and one-fifth the size of Dallas or San Diego. It is hemmed in by adjacent cities and states and cannot grow through annexation. The District is also the sixth densest city in America, with over 9,000 people per square mile. Population density is even higher when federal lands—which comprise almost 40 percent of the District of Columbia—are subtracted out. Land is a precious and limited resource here. 205.1 Figure 2.5 shows how land in the District is currently used. About 28 percent of the city is developed with housing, and more than one quarter is developed with street rights-of-way. About 20 percent of the city’s land area consists of permanent open space, including Rock Creek Park and the National Mall. About 600 acres of the city—or 1.5 percent of its land area—consists of vacant land. 205.2 [INSERT Figure 2.5, pie chart of city land use distribution] These statistics alone do not tell the full story of land use in the District. Since 1899, building height has been strictly regulated, giving the District a low visual profile and preventing the construction of buildings over about 14 stories tall. In addition, much of the city consists of historic districts with limited capacity for growth. Even many of the areas that are not “officially” historic are fully developed and have little potential for change. 205.3 Despite these limitations, there is room for growth in the District of Columbia. Key opportunities includegovernment lands underused commercial and industrial sites, and vacant buildings. Other 27 sites, including failed housing projects and ailing business districts, also present opportunities. There are also hundreds of small “infill” sites scattered throughout the city, especially in the northeast and southeast quadrants. Together, these areas hold the potential for thousands of new units of housing and millions of square feet of office and retail space. 205.4 Fitting such development into the fabric of a mature city creates a number of challenges. One is displacement, a threat that has become more real in the District as land values have increased. Displacement not only affects District residents—particularly those of lower income—it also affects businesses and municipal operations that may be dislocated by rising rents and land prices. 205.5 Whether the issue is displacement, the siting of locally undesirable uses, parking impacts, or threats to neighborhood character and stability, development creates tension in the District of Columbia. This CITYWIDE ELEMENTS COMPREHENSIVE PLAN DISTRICT ELEMENTS ADOPTED 12/19/06 P. 1-14 tension will only mount as growth pressures increase, making it even more important to have sound land use policies and development review procedures that mitigate the effects of competing and conflicting uses. 205.6 Figure 2.6 depicts the location of residential development in the city between 2000 and 2005. Of the 7,700 units of housing added, about one-third were located in Central Washington and 15 percent were located in Near Northwest. The Mid-City and Upper Northwest areas each absorbed about 12 percent of the District’s housing growth. About 20 percent of the new housing units were located east of the Anacostia River. However, much of this housing replaced units that were demolished, resulting in a very small net increase. 205.7 [INSERT Figure 2.6:Housing Development Activity, 2000-2005 205.9 Note: Figure to use revised Planning Area boundaries] 2.1.5 Mobility and Access Changes 206 The Washington region faces significant transportation challenges. Decentralization has caused longer commutes, increased congestion, and deteriorating air quality. The nationally recognized 2005 Urban Mobility Report found that Washington was the third most congested region in the country, behind Los Angeles and San Francisco. Funding to maintain the existing transportation system, let alone expand the system to meet increased demand, is severely constrained. 206.1 [PULLQUOTE: The nationally recognized 2005 Urban Mobility Report found that Washington was the third most congested region in the country, behind Los Angeles and San Francisco.] [Photo Caption: Parts of the Metrorail system are approaching capacity.] These challenges have propelled two opposing trends—one pushing development further out toward uncongested roads miles away from the city, and the other pushing development closer in, to areas where transit is available and shorter commutes are possible. They have also led to the recognition that increasing road capacity alone cannot solve the region’s traffic problems. Looking forward, increased investment in bus and rail transit, pedestrian and bicycle facilities, and other modes of travel, will be needed to sustain economic growth. 206.2 The District already has one of the most extensive transit systems in the country and ranks second only to New York in the percentage of residents using transit to go to work. The Metrorail and bus systems complement the city’s radial roadway system and maximize the movement of people across the city. However, many of those who need transit the most, including the poor and those with special needs, still 28 face mobility problems. Transit often does not connect District residents to jobs in the suburbs, and it may be expensive or difficult to access. In addition, parts of the Metrorail system are approaching capacity. 206.3 While it is difficult to predict the impacts that transportation constraints will have on the region over the next 20 years, linking land use decisions to transportation capacity will remain important. As with so many other aspects of planning in our region, regional planning and coordination with surrounding states and counties is the only way that effective solutions will be forged. 206.4 2.1.6 Environmental Changes 207 The District of Columbia was sited to take advantage of the unique environment and landscape at the confluence of the Anacostia and Potomac Rivers. Urbanization over the last 200 years has compromised CITYWIDE ELEMENTS COMPREHENSIVE PLAN DISTRICT ELEMENTS ADOPTED 12/19/06 P. 1-15 almost every aspect of this environment, leaving us with one of the most polluted rivers in the country, air quality that fails to meet federal standards, and a city where heavy tree cover has declined by more than half in the last 30 years alone. Of course, these are not issues unique to Washington. On a global level, issues such as fossil fuel depletion, climate change, sea level rise, and deforestation may have even more far-reaching impacts on the way we live and work in the future. 207.1 This Plan makes a conscious effort to promote natural resource conservation and environmental sustainability. It incorporates measurable goals such as reducing per capita energy consumption by one percent a year, recycling 45 percent of our solid waste stream, and making the Anacostia River fishable and swimmable by 2025. These goals can only achieved through fundamental changes in the way we live and the way we build. In the future, “green” building and “low impact development” will need to become the norm rather than the exception. The concept of sustainability runs through much of the Comprehensive Plan, from the renewal of brownfield sites to a renewed commitment to environmental justice in all neighborhoods of the city. 207.2 2.1.7 Technology Changes 208 Technology has changed how we live, work, and travel and it will continue to shape the District in unexpected ways. Twenty years ago, few predicted the scale at which computers would pervade every aspect of our lives. Since the 1980s, telecommuting has changed travel patterns; on-line purchases have changed retailing; and e-mail has changed the way business and government operate. 208.1 It is hard to fathom how advancements yet to be made will affect us in the future. The only thing that is certain is that technology will change our lives, with potentially profound spatial impacts. Such change may have more of an impact on Washington than it might in other cities, given the city’s role as a global and intellectual capital. The city is already a center of the information economy, and has demonstrated a strong pull for innovators from around the country and the world. 208.2 [PULLQUOTE: Technological advancements may have more of an impact on Washington than it might in other cities, given the city’s role as a global and intellectual capital. The city is already a center of the information economy, and has demonstrated a strong pull for innovators from around the country 29 and the world.] One aspect of technological change is its potential to deepen economic divides in the city. In 2004, the National Poverty Center reported that 85 percent of the nation’s White children had access to a home computer, compared to just 40 percent of Black and Latino children. Access to technology will be an important part of improving the well-being of District residents in the future. This will place a premium on education and training, and an emphasis on providing residents with the skills to use technology and access information. 208.3 2.1.8 Security Changes 209 Security is not a new concern or challenge in the District of Columbia. As a capital city, we are used to a heightened level of risk and the visibility of military personnel and operations. As an urban center, we also face daily concerns about personal safety and crime. But security concerns have taken on a new meaning since September 2001. The attacks on Washington and New York changed the psyche of our city and ushered in an uncertainty about the future that still persists today. 209.1 Over the past five years, we have struggled with the need to balance beauty, access, and openness with the need to protect our landmarks, government buildings, and officials from danger. The federal government has strived to discourage acts of terrorism through the design and management of public CITYWIDE ELEMENTS COMPREHENSIVE PLAN DISTRICT ELEMENTS ADOPTED 12/19/06 P. 1-16 spaces and buildings, including the closing of some District streets and retrofitting of major landmarks. Security issues have also been cited in decisions to shift the federal workforce to more remote locations. They also have resulted in design standards for federally leased space that will reverberate through the regional office market for many years to come. 209.2 These concerns are not likely to diminish in the future. The need to balance our desire for safety, accessibility, and aesthetics is one of the key challenges that this plan seeks to address.209.3 2.1.9 Fiscal Changes 210 When the District received limited Home Rule in 1973, it incurred a variety of cost burdens, including the responsibility for providing many services that are typically provided by states. Revenue restrictions also were imposed, including the inability to impose a “commuter tax” on income earned in the city by nonresidents. The result of these burdens and restrictions has been a financial “structural imbalance” that persists to this day. A 2002 report by the federal General Accounting Office estimated that the imbalance exceeded $470 million a year. 210.1 The imbalance is amplified by the large amount of land in the city that is owned by the federal government and therefore not subject to property tax. Indeed, 53 percent of all land in the District is nontaxable, and more than two-thirds of the income earned in the District cannot be locally taxed. 210.2 One outcome of the imbalance is that District residents and businesses face the highest tax burden in the nation. Another is that major investments in infrastructure and capital improvements have been deferred. The District has hesitated to cut services, raise taxes or incur more debt, and instead has sought other remedies to reduce the imbalance. 210.3 One of these remedies has been to “grow” the population of the District of Columbia. A well- publicized 30 target of adding 100,000 residents to the city’s population was set in 2003, motivated in part by a desire to boost the number of taxpaying residents. The District has also worked to increase the income of current residents, which can in turn lift families out of poverty, generate tax revenues, and reduce social service costs. A key component of improving the city’s fiscal health as well as the economic prosperity of its residents is to increase the number of employed residents and thus the economic and tax base of the city. 210.4 [PULLQUOTE: A key component of improving the city’s fiscal health as well as the economic prosperity of its residents is to increase the number of employed residents and thus the economic and tax base of the city.] Fortunately, economic growth in the city has helped improve the District’s fiscal standing, at least in the short term. A decade ago, the District was on the brink of bankruptcy. The situation has improved markedly, in part as a result of actions taken by the Government of the District of Columbia. Despite the optimistic forecasts of the Comprehensive Plan, there is no guarantee that this good fortune will last. Prudent action is needed to avoid problems should future downturns take place. 210.5 The District’s fiscal situation will continue to influence land use and economic development choices. It is currently driving the redevelopment of large former federal sites with tax-generating uses, creation of new retail centers that reduce the “leakage” of sales tax dollars to the suburbs, and development of highincome, high-density housing downtown and elsewhere. Such efforts may reduce the imbalance but are unlikely to eliminate it. The most effective strategies will combine revenue-raising strategies with strategies to break the cycle of poverty in District neighborhoods. 210.6 CITYWIDE ELEMENTS COMPREHENSIVE PLAN DISTRICT ELEMENTS ADOPTED 12/19/06 P. 1-17 [Photo Caption: The “federal presence” remains Washington’s most prominent and visible asset.] 2.1.10 Global City, Local City 211 One of the most obvious forces influencing planning in the District is the city’s dual role as a world capital and a residential community. There is the Washington of lore, the city of inaugural parades, museums, and monuments—the place that school textbooks describe as “belonging to all of America.” And there is the city most of us know, comprised of neighborhoods, shopping districts, schools, corner stores, churches, and parks. Even the Comprehensive Plan itself is divided into District and Federal Elements, suggesting that federal interests may not always align with the goals of the city’s residents and businesses. 211.1 The tension between Washington’s global and local roles plays out in a number of ways. Conflicts around fiscal issues and security have already been noted. Issues such as embassy siting, plans for federal lands, funding for Metrorail, and Congressional oversight on local land use and public facility decisions have been the focus of much debate and discussion in the past. The District itself seems partitioned at times, with the federal government functioning as a “city within the city”. 211.2 Yet in spite of these conflicts, the “federal presence” remains Washington’s most prominent and visible asset. It provides tens of thousands of jobs for District residents, attracts millions of visitors to the city, and sustains cultural institutions that would not otherwise be possible. It makes Washington an international and multi-cultural center, second only to New York on the eastern seaboard. The federal 31 presence requires that our plans take a broader perspective than the metropolitan region, and recognize that we are more susceptible to global events than places like Baltimore, Detroit, and other cities of similar size. 211.3 The District’s role in the world economy has become increasingly important during the past 50 years. The Association of Foreign Investors in Real Estate has ranked Washington as the top city in the world for foreign investment for three consecutive years. The region is one of the leading gateways for immigration into the United States. We are home to such institutions as the World Bank and International Monetary Fund. Our emergence as a global center has implications for our communication systems, our transportation and infrastructure needs, our cultural life, and our real estate and development markets. 211.4 These changes create vast potential for increased prosperity. But they also create the threat of disruption and a changing identity for many parts of the city. City plans must clearly articulate the values to be preserved and the places to be protected as we contemplate where we as a city hope to be in 20 years and beyond. 211.5 2.2 Looking Forward: Growth Forecasts 212 The driving forces described in the last section suggest a different future for the District of Columbia than was imagined when the 1984 Comprehensive Plan was drafted. The 1984 Plan was prepared during a period of long-term population and economic decline. Even the Ward Plans prepared during the late 1980s and early 1990s focused on preventing neighborhood decline and unwanted intrusions. Today, the continued strength of the Washington economy, coupled with transportation and environmental limits to regional expansion, suggest that the city will capture a larger share of the region’s growth in the future than it has in the past. This assumption is bolstered by an unprecedented amount of development in the “pipeline” and joint federal/ District proposals for federal land transfers. 212.1 CITYWIDE ELEMENTS COMPREHENSIVE PLAN DISTRICT ELEMENTS ADOPTED 12/19/06 P. 1-18 Please refer to the Economic Development Element of the Comprehensive Plan for a detailed discussion of the District’s economic growth opportunities and challenges within the context of the region. The growth forecasts used in this Comprehensive Plan are driven by two factors: land supply and regional growth projections. Each of these is described below. 212.2 [Photo Caption: Housing construction at Wheeler Creek in the Congress Heights neighborhood] 2.2.1 Land Supply 213 Land supply in the District of Columbia includes “pipeline” sites, vacant infill sites, underutilized sites, large sites, and other sites. These categories are mutually exclusive, meaning there is no double counting between them. 213.1 Pipeline sites are sites where specific development projects are already planned or under construction. Such sites comprise over 800 acres in the District. They represent 20,000 housing units and about 20 million square feet of commercial space. The degree of certainty that these projects will be built in the next 10 years is relatively high. 213.2 Vacant infill sites comprise about 600 acres in the District and are not associated with any particular project or proposal. They are generally less than ten acres and include a mix of privately owned 32 properties and publicly-owned sites. Some 440 acres of this land is residentially zoned, including about 160 acres of multi-family zoned land, and 280 acres of land zoned for single family and townhomes. About 40 vacant acres are commercially zoned and 20 vacant acres are industrially zoned. While vacant lots occur in all parts of the city, about half of the city’s vacant land is located east of the Anacostia River. 213.3 Underutilized sites comprise about 345 acres. For the purposes of the Comprehensive Plan, these are defined as commercially and industrially zoned properties containing structures with low assessed values. Examples might include auto body shops, car washes, and fast food restaurants located in high- density commercial districts. This does not necessarily mean these uses should be displaced—it simply means the private market will create pressure to replace them over time. The underutilized sites tend to be clustered along corridor streets such as New York Avenue, Benning Road, and Georgia Avenue. 213.4 Large sites in the District include about a dozen properties or clusters of adjoining properties, with the potential for reuse during the next 20 years. They range in size from 25 acres to over 300 acres. They include sites that already contain extensive development, like DC Village and Reservation 13, and sites that are largely vacant, such as Poplar Point and the McMillan Reservoir Sand Filtration site. These sites hold many possibilities for the future, from large mixed use communities to new parks and open spaces. In total, the large sites represent about 1,500 acres. Some have already been master planned for new uses; the future of others has yet to be determined. Some are federally owned, and some are owned by the District. The Office of Planning estimates that federally owned sites will account for less than 10 percent of the District’s job and household growth in the next 20 years. 213.5 There are many other sites in the District where development could occur. These include approximately 2,000 vacant buildings, many of which contain multiple vacant housing units. Some of these buildings can be renovated and others are likely to be demolished and replaced. There are also freeways and railyards, in some cases with developable air rights above. There are at least eight aging housing projects that have been identified as possible “new communities.” There are also hundreds of properties in the CITYWIDE ELEMENTS COMPREHENSIVE PLAN DISTRICT ELEMENTS ADOPTED 12/19/06 P. 1-19 city that are developed below the maximum square footage allowed by zoning. Some property owners may choose to replace what is on these lots today with something larger in the future. 213.6 [PULLQUOTE: Hundreds of properties in the city are developed below the maximum square footage allowed by zoning. Some property owners may choose to replace what is on these lots today with something larger in the future.] Table 2.1 summarizes vacant and underutilized commercial land within the District and provides an estimate of potential additional development that these lands could accommodate based on existing zoning. 213.7 Table 2.1: Vacant and Underutilized Lands Citywide 213.8 Acres Dwelling Units Total Non-Residential (millions Sq ft) Vacant Land 588 11,000 8 Underutilized Sites 345 7,200 24 Units rounded to the nearest 1000 33 2.2.2 The Cooperative Forecasts 214 The Metropolitan Washington Council of Governments (MWCOG) coordinates socio-economic projections for the Washington region. These projections include households, population, and jobs and are expressed in five-year intervals, currently to 2030. Projections are made for the region as a whole and for each of its 17 jurisdictions. They take into account national economic trends, local demographics, and the local plans and policies of the region’s cities and counties. 214.1 At the regional level, the projections have been relatively accurate since the forecasting program began in 1975. Actual growth during the last 30 years has tracked closely with what the forecasts predicted. 214.2 [Photo caption: Based on building permits, there were 8,100 units added and about 2,100 units demolished between 2000 and 2005, for a net gain of about 6,000 units.] In 2005, the MWCOG board approved projections showing the region would add one million jobs between 2005 and 2025. The projections further show an addition of 550,000 households and 1.35 million residents during this time period. About 43 percent of this growth is expected to occur in “outer” suburbs such as Loudoun, Frederick, and Prince William Counties. The “inner” suburbs of Fairfax, Montgomery, and Prince George’s Counties are expected to absorb about 42 percent. The remaining 15 percent is expected to occur within the District, Arlington, and Alexandria. 214.3 Figure 2.7 indicates the location of regional activity clusters in the Washington Metropolitan Area. These clusters were identified cooperatively by jurisdictions in the MWCOG area in 2002. They are intended to provide an organizing framework for directing regional job and housing growth. As the Figure indicates, some of the clusters are more than 40 miles from the District and are larger in land area than all of Central Washington. Despite the designation of these areas, MWCOG indicates that only about 40 percent of the region’s housing growth and 70 percent of its job growth are projected to occur in the regional activity centers during the next 20 years. This means that increased congestion and urban sprawl are likely. Expanded coordination in land use and transportation planning among the region’s cities and counties will be essential to keep the region sustainable. 214.4 [Insert Figure 2.7: Regional Activity Clusters 214.5] CITYWIDE ELEMENTS COMPREHENSIVE PLAN DISTRICT ELEMENTS ADOPTED 12/19/06 P. 1-20 2.2.3 Projected Growth, 2005-2025 215 The District’s projections are based on a combination of the regional forecasts, approved and planned development, and land supply estimates. Table 2.2 provides a summary. 215.1 Table 2.2: Population, Household and Job Forecasts, 2005-2025 215.2 2005 2010 2015 2020 2025 20-year change Households 254,700 265,800 279,700 295,700 311,800 57,100 Population 576,700 599,300 630,000 664,000 698,000 121,200 Employment 745,400 783,800 819,600 845,700 870,400 125,000 *The District’s population includes about 37,200 people living in group quarters (dormitories, institutions, nursing homes, etc For projection purposes, this population is expected to remain about the same over the next 20 years. Household and Population Growth Because the Census is only taken every 10 years, estimates of population and household growth begin with 2005 “baseline” estimates. These figures are based on the 2000 Census, plus an estimate of net 34 new households and residents added between 2000 and 2005. 215.2 The city’s estimates do not match the U.S. Census estimates, which show a loss of 20,000 residents during the 2000-2005 period. District estimates are based on a series of indicators, such as net housing additions, vacancy rates, school enrollment, IRS tax returns, and utility connections. The Census' annual estimate is not used as the baseline in part because it has historically underestimated the District’s population.1 For example, the annual Census estimate for 1999 was 53,000 people below the actual number reported during the decennial census in 2000. 215.3 Based on building permits, there were 8,100 units added and about 2,100 units demolished between 2000 and 2005, for a net gain of about 6,000 units. Accounting for vacancies, the 2005 household total is estimated at 254,700. Population has been relatively stable and is currently estimated at 576,700. The average household size declined from 2.16 to 2.12 between 2000 and 2005. 215.4 The 2005-2010 growth increment consists of actual projects that are now under construction. This growth will result in a net gain of about 11,000 households and is expected to increase the city’s population to almost 600,000 by the 2010 census. This assumes that household size will stay at 2.12. 215.6 Growth forecasts for 2010-2015 are based on specific projects that are still in the planning stages. About 14,000 households are expected to be added during this period, bringing the city’s population to 630,000 by 2015. 215.7 1 In Spring 2006, the District successfully challenged the US Census 2005 population estimate. The Census revised the estimate to 582,000, representing an increase of 10,000 residents since 2000. The District’s official forecasts reflect a lower 2005 household size than was used in the Census challenge (2.12 vs 2.16 and consequently reflect lower baseline figures 215.5 CITYWIDE ELEMENTS COMPREHENSIVE PLAN DISTRICT ELEMENTS ADOPTED 12/19/06 P. 1-21 From 2015 to 2025, much of the District’s growth is expected to occur on the large sites described earlier in this Element. Assuming the pace of growth experienced between 2005 and 2015 is sustained, another 32,000 households will be added. Household size is expected to remain at 2.12, bringing the total population to 698,000. This is approximately the same number of residents the District had in 1973, but residing in about 50,000 more households. 215.8 The biggest unknown in the forecasts is household size. If the District continues to lose families and attract only small one- and two-person households, it may well add 57,000 households in the next 20 years with no gain in population. Household size will only be maintained at its current level if the District retains its families, keeps young professionals in the city as they form families, and provides a healthy environment for new families in its established single family and rowhouse neighborhoods. Indeed, the number of families with children in the District declined from 62,000 in 1990 to 51,000 in 2000, with an attendant drop in citywide household size. 215.9 [PULLQUOTE: Household size will only be maintained at its current level if the District retains its families, keeps young professionals in the city as they form families, and provides a healthy environment for new families in its established single family and rowhouse neighborhoods.] Other factors affecting population forecasts are housing costs, immigration, and K-12 school quality. Higher housing costs have already caused families to “double up” in some parts of the city, and may result in adult children returning home or living at home longer. Immigration also may drive increases in household sizes, as it has in New York, San Francisco, and other gateway cities. Improvement in the District’s public schools will make the city a more attractive place for families with young children. These forces could offset some of the decline in household size. 215.10 35 The household and population forecasts suggest that the District of Columbia will capture 10 percent of the region’s growth during 2005-2025. By 2025, the District will represent 11 percent of the region’s population, which is a slightly smaller share than it has today. 215.11 Employment Growth Employment forecasts are based on estimates from the District Department of Employment Services. The baseline (2005) estimates build on monthly data reported by the Bureau of Labor Statistics, Dun &amp;amp; Bradstreet, and other sources, with adjustments for self-employment and military personnel. The forecasts from 2005 to 2015 are largely based on actual projects under construction in the city, as well as office, retail, hotel, industrial, and institutional development that is currently planned and proposed. 215.12 Beyond 2015, the projections presume a continuation of 2000-2015 trends. Continued growth in the service sector is expected, with about 5,000 jobs a year added between 2015 and 2025. Between 2005 and 2025, the District is expected to add 125,000 new jobs, bringing the citywide total to 870,400 jobs. 215.13 The employment forecasts suggest that the District of Columbia will capture 13 percent of the region’s job growth during 2005-2025. By 2025, the District will have 21 percent of the region’s jobs, which is a slightly smaller share than it has today. 215.14 CITYWIDE ELEMENTS COMPREHENSIVE PLAN DISTRICT ELEMENTS ADOPTED 12/19/06 P. 1-22 [BEGIN TEXTBOX] Translating the Forecasts into Demand for Land 215.15 How much land does it take to accommodate 57,000 housing units and 125,000 jobs? The answer depends on the density of new development. Other factors, such as the size of housing units, the types of jobs being created, and the amount of land set aside for parking and open space also weigh in. The diagram below shows three scenarios. 215.16 The first illustrates the land that would be required for single family homes (at 6 units per acre) and onestory campus-style office buildings. About 13,000 acres would be necessary. The second scenario shows land requirements for housing built at row house densities (25 units per acre with the jobs housed in five-story office buildings. About 3,000 acres would be required. The third scenario shows land requirements for housing built at apartment densities of about 125 units per acre, with the jobs housed in ten-story office buildings. Land consumption drops to under 1,000 acres. 215.17 Of course, the diagram simplifies the actual dynamics of how land is used and developed. It also leaves out land that must be set aside for parks, public facilities, and infrastructure. The District expects some combination of high, medium, and low density development during the next 20 years. However, high land costs and the scarcity of land in the city make denser development more likely on most of the remaining vacant sites. 215.18 [END TEXTBOX] Growth by Planning Area Tables 2.3 and 2.4 show where household and job growth is expected to take place within the city over the next 20 years. The estimates reflect the location of planned development projects, vacant and underutilized sites, and Comprehensive Plan land use designations and policies. 215.19 The tables indicate that about 30 percent of the city’s future household growth will occur in Central Washington and along the Lower Anacostia Waterfront. This reflects current and expected 36 development in and around Downtown, the North of Massachusetts Avenue (NoMA) area, the Southwest Waterfront, the Near Southeast, and on large sites such as Poplar Point. Other areas east of the Anacostia River represent about 20 percent of the projected total. The Mid-City and Near North areas also represent a combined total of 20 percent, with most of the gain expected east of 14th Street NW, especially around Howard University, Columbia Heights, and Shaw. Additional data and guidance for each of these areas is provided in the Area Elements of the Comprehensive Plan. 215.20 Employment growth will be concentrated in Central Washington and along the Anacostia River. These two areas are expected to absorb three-quarters of the city’s job growth, principally in places like the South Capitol Street Corridor, the Southeast Federal Center, and the New York Avenue Metro Station area. About five percent of the city’s job growth is projected to take place in Upper Northeast, especially along the New York Avenue corridor. Another eight percent is expected east of the Anacostia River on sites such as St. Elizabeths and the Minnesota Avenue Metro Station Area The remaining six planning areas represent less than 15 percent of the city’s job growth, most associated with institutional uses and infill office and retail development along corridor streets. 215.21 CITYWIDE ELEMENTS COMPREHENSIVE PLAN DISTRICT ELEMENTS ADOPTED 12/19/06 P. 1-23 [PULLQUOTE: Employment growth will be concentrated in Central Washington and along the Anacostia River.

This section establishes 36 underlying principles for the future that reflect this context. Most of these principles are based on A Vision for Growing an Inclusive City, the policy framework for the Comprehensive Plan Revision endorsed by the Council of the District of Columbia in 2004. However, statements from the previous Comprehensive Plan and other documents that set the frame for more detailed planning in the District also are incorporated. Policies in each Element of the Comprehensive Plan elaborate on the city’s commitment to following these principles. 216.1 The principles are grouped into five sections Managing Growth and Change Creating Successful Neighborhoods Increasing Access to Education and Employment Connecting the City Building Green and Healthy Communities. 216.2 The principles acknowledge that the benefits and opportunities of living in the District are not available to everyone equally and that divisions in the city physical, social and economic must be overcome to move from vision to reality. 216.3 [PULLQUOTE: The following principles acknowledge that the benefits and opportunities of living in the District are not available to everyone equally and that divisions in the city physical, social and economic must be overcome to move from vision to reality.] [BEGIN 5-PAGE TEXT BOX] Managing Growth and Change: Guiding Principles 217 (1) Change in the District of Columbia is both inevitable and desirable. The key is to manage change in ways that protect the positive aspects of life in the city and reduce negatives such as poverty, crime, and homelessness. 217.1 (2) A city must be diverse to thrive, and the District cannot sustain itself by only attracting small, affluent households. To retain residents and attract a diverse population, the city should provide services that support families. A priority must be placed on sustaining and promoting safe neighborhoods offering health care, quality education, transportation, child care, parks, libraries, 38 arts and cultural facilities, and housing for families 217.2 (3) Diversity also means maintaining and enhancing the District's mix of housing types. Housing should be developed for households of different sizes, including growing families as well as singles and couples. 217.3 (4) The District needs both residential and non-residential growth to survive. Non-residential growth benefits residents by creating jobs and opportunities for less affluent households to increase their income. 217.4 (5) Much of the growth that is forecast during the next 20 years is expected to occur on large sites that are currently isolated from the rest of the city. Rather than letting these sites develop as gated or CITYWIDE ELEMENTS COMPREHENSIVE PLAN DISTRICT ELEMENTS ADOPTED 12/19/06 P. 1-26 self-contained communities, they should become part of the city’s urban fabric through the continuation of street patterns, open space corridors and compatible development patterns where they meet existing neighborhoods. Since the District is landlocked, its large sites must be viewed as extraordinarily valuable assets. Not all should be used right away—some should be “banked” for the future. 217.5 (6) Redevelopment and infill opportunities along corridors and near transit stations will be an important component of reinvigorating and enhancing our neighborhoods. Development on such sites must not compromise the integrity of stable neighborhoods and must be designed to respect the broader community context. Adequate infrastructure capacity should be ensured as growth occurs. 217.6 (7) Growth in the District benefits not only District residents, but the region as well. By accommodating a larger number of jobs and residents, we can create the critical mass needed to support new services, sustain public transit, and improve regional environmental quality. 217.7 Creating Successful Neighborhoods: Guiding Principles 218 (8) The residential character of neighborhoods must be protected, maintained and improved. Many District neighborhoods possess social, economic, historic, and physical qualities that make them unique and desirable places in which to live. These qualities can lead to development and redevelopment pressures that threaten the very qualities that make the neighborhoods attractive. These pressures must be controlled through zoning and other means to ensure that neighborhood character is preserved and enhanced. 218.1 (9) Many neighborhoods include commercial and institutional uses that contribute to their character. Neighborhood businesses, retail districts, schools, park and recreational facilities, houses of worship and other public facilities all make our communities more livable. These uses provide strong centers that reinforce neighborhood identity and provide destinations and services for residents. They too must be protected and stabilized. 218.2 (10) The recent housing boom has triggered a crisis of affordability in the city, creating a hardship for many District residents and changing the character of neighborhoods. The preservation of existing affordable housing and the production of new affordable housing both are essential to avoid a deepening of racial and economic divides in the city. Affordable renter- and owner-occupied housing production and preservation is central to the idea of growing more inclusively. 218.3 (11) The District of Columbia contains many buildings and sites that contribute to its identity. Protecting historic resources through preservation laws and other programs is essential to retain the heritage that defines and distinguishes the city. Special efforts should be made to conserve row houses as the defining element of many District neighborhoods, and to restore neighborhood “main streets” through sensitive renovation and updating. 218.4 (12) Each neighborhood is an integral part of a diverse larger community that contributes to the District’s identity. Growing an inclusive city means that all neighborhoods should share in the overall social responsibilities of the community, including housing the homeless, feeding the hungry, and accommodating the disabled. 218.5 (13) Enhanced public safety is one of the District’s highest priorities and is vital to the health of our neighborhoods. The District must continue to improve safety and security, and sustain a high level of emergency police, fire, and medical assistance. Moreover, the District must engage in CITYWIDE ELEMENTS COMPREHENSIVE PLAN DISTRICT ELEMENTS ADOPTED 12/19/06 P. 1-27 39 appropriate planning and capital investments to reduce the likelihood and severity of future emergencies. 218.6 (14) Confidence in government begins at the neighborhood level. It is built block-by-block, based on day-to-day relationships and experiences. Meaningful citizen participation and quality, responsive neighborhood services are essential to sustain successful neighborhoods. 218.7 (15) Public input in decisions about land use and development is an essential part of creating successful neighborhoods, from development of the Comprehensive Plan to every facet of its implementation. 218.8 Policies and actions to support neighborhoods cut across many Comprehensive Plan topics and appear throughout this document. Wherever they may appear, these policies are underpinned by the common goal of conserving functioning, stable neighborhoods and improving those that need redirection. 218.9 Increasing Access to Education and Employment: Guiding Principles 219 (16) Increasing access to jobs and education by District residents is fundamental to improving the lives and economic well being of District residents. Education must equip students with the skills and tools to succeed. 219.1 (17) An economically strong and viable District of Columbia is essential to the economic health and well being of the region. Thus, a broad spectrum of private and public growth (with an appropriate level of supporting infrastructure) should be encouraged. The District’s economic development strategies must capitalize on the city’s location at the center of the region’s transportation and communication systems. 219.2 (18) Increasing access to education and employment is linked to broader social goals such as strengthening families, creating a better future for the city’s youth, and reducing chronic and concentrated poverty. Therefore, physical plans for the city must be accompanied by plans and programs to improve our educational system, improve literacy and job training, and link residents to quality jobs. 219.3 (19) The overarching goals of the Comprehensive Plan cannot be achieved without sustained investment in public school and library facilities. The physical condition of these facilities must be improved before the vision of a more inclusive city can be truly achieved. 219.4 (20) Colleges and universities make the District an intellectual capital as well as a political capital. They are an essential part of the District’s plans to grow its “knowledge-based” economy, improve access to learning, and broaden economic prosperity for all District residents. Sustaining our colleges and universities is important, as is protecting the integrity of the communities of which they are a part. Encouraging access to higher education for all residents in vitally important, as is locating higher education facilities in neighborhoods currently underserved by such facilities. 219.5 (21) Land development policies should be focused to create job opportunities for District residents. This means that sufficient land should be planned and zoned for new job centers in areas with high unemployment and under-employment. A mix of employment opportunities to meet the needs of residents with varied job skills should be provided. 219.6 CITYWIDE ELEMENTS COMPREHENSIVE PLAN DISTRICT ELEMENTS ADOPTED 12/19/06 P. 1-28 (22) Providing more efficient, convenient, and affordable transportation for residents to access jobs in the District and in the surrounding region is critical to achieve the goal of increasing District residents’ access to employment. 219.7 (23) Downtown should be strengthened as the region’s major employment center, as its cultural center; as a center for government, tourism and international business; and as an exciting urban mixed-use neighborhood. Policies should strive to increase the number of jobs for District residents, enhance retail opportunities, promote access to Downtown from across the District and the region, and restore Downtown’s prominence as the heart of the city. 219.8 (24) Despite the recent economic resurgence in the city, the District has yet to reach its full economic 40 potential. Expanding the economy means increasing shopping and services for many District neighborhoods, bringing tourists beyond the National Mall and into the city’s business districts, and creating more opportunities for local entrepreneurs and small businesses. The District’s economic development expenditures should help support local businesses and provide economic benefits to the community. 219.9 Connecting the City: Guiding Principles 220 (25) Increased mobility can no longer be achieved simply by building more roads. The priority must be on investment in other forms of transportation, particularly transit. Mobility can be enhanced further by improving the connections between different transportation modes, improving traveler safety and security, and increasing system efficiency. 220.1 (26) Transportation facilities, including streets, bridges, transit, sidewalks, and paths, provide access to land and they provide mobility for residents and others. Investments in the transportation network must be balanced to serve local access needs for pedestrians, bicyclists, transit users, autos and delivery trucks as well as the needs of residents and others to move around and through the city. 220.2 (27) Washington’s wide avenues are a lasting legacy of the 1791 L’Enfant Plan and are still one of the city’s most distinctive features. The “great streets” of the city should be reinforced as an element of Washington’s design through transportation, streetscape, and economic development programs. 220.3 (28) Connections to and between the city’s celebrated open spaces, such as Rock Creek Park and the National Mall, should be improved. At the same time, creation of new parks along the Anacostia River and enhancement of the federal Fort Circle Parks, should be supported to connect communities and enhance “green infrastructure” in the city. 220.4 (29) The District continues to grow in reputation as an international cultural center. To sustain this growth, it must continue to support a healthy arts and cultural community through its land use, housing, and economic development policies. The power of the arts to express the identity of each community while connecting neighborhoods and residents must be recognized. 220.5 (30) Residents are connected by places of “common ground,” such as Union Station and Eastern Market. Such public gathering places should be protected, and should be created in all parts of the city as development and change occurs. 220.6 (31) The District’s communities are connected by a shared heritage of urban design, reflecting the legacy of the L’Enfant Plan, the McMillan Plan, the Height Act of 1910, and preservation of much CITYWIDE ELEMENTS COMPREHENSIVE PLAN DISTRICT ELEMENTS ADOPTED 12/19/06 P. 1-29 of the historic urban fabric. After more than two centuries of building, the nation’s capital is still a remarkable place. Urban design and streetscape policies must retain the historic, majestic, and beautiful qualities that make Washington unique among American cities. 220.7 Building Green and Healthy Communities: Guiding Principles 221 (32) The site selected for the national capital was characterized by a very special topography, including hills interlaced with broad rivers and streams. The topography allowed for the construction of a special collection of buildings that give the District a unique profile. This profile has been further protected by local and national ordinances and must continue to be protected in the future. This should include the protection of views and vistas and the enhancement of city gateways. 221.1 (33) The earth, water, air, and biotic resources of the District must be protected. Furthermore, such resources should be restored and enhanced where they have been degraded by past human activities. In particular, reforestation of the District and maintenance of its tree cover should be emphasized to sustain the District’s reputation as one of America’s “greenest” cities. 221.2 (34) As the nation’s capital, the District should be a role model for environmental sustainability. Building construction and renovation should minimize the use of non-renewable resources, promote energy and water conservation, and reduce harmful effects on the natural environment. 221.3 (35) Planning decisions should improve the health of District residents by reducing exposure to hazardous materials, improving the quality of surface and groundwater, and encouraging land use patterns and land uses that reduce air pollution and facilitate pedestrian and bicycle travel. 221.4 41 (36) The District’s parks and open spaces provide health, recreational, psychological, aesthetic, and ecological benefits that contribute to the quality of life. Maintenance and improvement of existing parks, and increased access to open space and recreation across the city are basic elements of the city’s vision. The District’s public open spaces should be protected against exploitation, and their recreational and environmental values should be conserved. 221.5 [END FIVE-PAGE TEXTBOX] 2.4 Putting It All Together 222 Taken together, the driving forces, projections, and guiding principles in the Framework Element provide a foundation for planning the future of the District of Columbia. The remaining elements of the Comprehensive Plan examine these conditions in much more detail and outline the journey from vision to reality. 222.1 2.4.1 Generalized Policy Map 223 The purpose of the Generalized Policy Map is to categorize how different parts of the District may change between 2005 and 2025. It highlights areas where more detailed policies are necessary, both within the Comprehensive Plan and in follow-up plans, to manage this change. 223.1 The map should be used to guide land use decision-making in conjunction with the Comprehensive Plan text, the Future Land Use Map, and other Comprehensive Plan maps. Boundaries on the map are to be CITYWIDE ELEMENTS COMPREHENSIVE PLAN DISTRICT ELEMENTS ADOPTED 12/19/06 P. 1-30 interpreted in concert with these other sources, as well as the actual physical characteristics of each location shown. 223.2 Categories The Generalized Policy Map identifies the following four different types of areas: Neighborhood Conservation Areas, Neighborhood Enhancement Areas, Land Use Change Areas, and Commercial/ Mixed Use Areas. 223.3 Neighborhood Conservation Areas Neighborhood Conservation areas have very little vacant or underutilized land. They are primarily residential in character. Maintenance of existing land uses and community character is anticipated over the next 20 years. Where change occurs, it will be modest in scale and will consist primarily of scattered site infill housing, public facilities, and institutional uses. Major changes in density over current (2005) conditions are not expected but some new development and reuse opportunities are anticipated. Neighborhood Conservation Areas that are designated “PDR” on the Future Land Use Map are expected to be retained with the mix of industrial, office, and retail uses they have historically provided. 223.4 The guiding philosophy in Neighborhood Conservation Areas is to conserve and enhance established neighborhoods. Limited development and redevelopment opportunities do exist within these areas but they are small in scale. The diversity of land uses and building types in these areas should be maintained and new development and alterations should be compatible with the existing scale and architectural character of each area. Densities in Neighborhood Conservation Areas are guided by the Future Land Use Map. 223.5 [PULLQUOTE: Neighborhood Conservation areas have very little vacant or underutilized land. Maintenance of existing land uses and community character is anticipated over the next 20 years. Where change occurs, it will be modest in scale and will consist primarily of scattered site infill housing, public facilities, and institutional uses] 42 Neighborhood Enhancement Areas Neighborhood Enhancement Areas are neighborhoods with substantial amounts of vacant residentially zoned land. They are primarily residential in character. Many of these areas are characterized by a patchwork of existing homes and individual vacant lots, some privately owned and others owned by the public sector or non-profit developers. These areas present opportunities for compatible small-scale infill development, including new single family homes, townhomes, and other density housing types. Land uses that reflect the historical mixture and diversity of each community should be encouraged. 223.6 The guiding philosophy in Neighborhood Enhancement Areas is to ensure that new development “fits-in” and responds to the existing character, natural features, and existing/planned infrastructure capacity. New housing should be encouraged to improve the neighborhood and must be consistent with the land use designation on the Future Land Use Map. The unique and special qualities of each area should be maintained and conserved, and overall neighborhood character should be protected as development takes place. Publicly-owned open space within these areas should be preserved and enhanced to make these communities more attractive and desirable. 223.7 The main difference between Neighborhood Enhancement and Neighborhood Conservation Areas is the large amount of vacant land that exists in the Enhancement Areas. Neighborhood Enhancement Areas often contain many acres of undeveloped lots, whereas Neighborhood Conservation Areas appear to be “built out.” As infill development takes place on undeveloped lots, special care must be taken to avoid displacement nearby. Existing housing should be enhanced through rehabilitation assistance. New CITYWIDE ELEMENTS COMPREHENSIVE PLAN DISTRICT ELEMENTS ADOPTED 12/19/06 P. 1-31 development in these areas should improve the real estate market, reduce crime and blight, and attract complementary new uses and services that better serve the needs of existing and future residents. 223.8 [PULLQUOTE: The guiding philosophy in Neighborhood Enhancement Areas is to ensure that new development “fits-in” and responds to the existing character, natural features, and existing/planned infrastructure capacity.] Land Use Change Areas Land Use Change Areas are areas where change to a different land use from what exists today is anticipated. In some cases, the Future Land Use Map depicts the specific mix of uses expected for these areas. In other cases, the Future Land Use Map shows these sites as “Federal”, indicating the District does not have the authority to determine land uses, but expects a change by 2025. 223.9 There are more than two dozen Land Use Change Areas identified on the Policy Map. They include many of the city’s large development opportunity sites, and other smaller sites that are undergoing redevelopment or that are anticipated to undergo redevelopment. Together, they represent much of the city’s supply of vacant and underutilized land. 223.10 The guiding philosophy in the Land Use Change Areas is to encourage and facilitate new development and promote the adaptive reuse of existing structures. Many of these areas have the capacity to become mixed-use communities containing housing, retail shops, services, workplaces, parks and civic facilities. The Comprehensive Plan’s Area Elements provide additional policies to guide development and 43 redevelopment within the Land Use Change Areas, including the desired mix of uses in each area. 223.11 As Land Use Change Areas are redeveloped, the District aspires to create high quality environments that include exemplary site and architectural design and that are compatible with and do not negatively impact nearby neighborhoods. Programs to avoid and mitigate any undesirable impacts of development of the Land Use Change Areas upon adjacent neighborhoods should be required as necessary. 223.12 [PULLQUOTE: The guiding philosophy in the Land Use Change Areas is to encourage and facilitate new development and promote the adaptive reuse of existing structures.] Commercial/ Mixed Use Areas These classifications correspond to the city’s business districts, many of which form the heart of its neighborhoods. Five categories are used, defining the physical and economic character of each area along with generalized long-range conservation and development objectives. The commercial areas defined are: “Main Street mixed use corridors “neighborhood commercial centers,” “multi-neighborhood commercial centers”, “regional commercial centers,” and “central employment area.” 223.13 Main Street Mixed Use Corridors. These are traditional commercial business corridors with a concentration of older storefronts along the street. The service area for Main Streets can vary from one neighborhood (e.g 14th Street Heights or Barracks Row) to multiple neighborhoods (e.g Dupont Circle, H Street, or Adams Morgan Their common feature is that they have a pedestrian-oriented environment with traditional storefronts. Many have upper story residential or office uses. Conservation and enhancement of these corridors is desired to foster economic and housing opportunities and serve neighborhood needs. Any development or redevelopment that occurs should support transit use and enhance the pedestrian environment. 223.14 Neighborhood Commercial Centers: Neighborhood Commercial Centers meet the day-to-day needs of residents and workers in the adjacent neighborhoods. Their service area is usually less than one mile. Typical uses include convenience stores, sundries, small food markets, supermarkets, branch banks, CITYWIDE ELEMENTS COMPREHENSIVE PLAN DISTRICT ELEMENTS ADOPTED 12/19/06 P. 1-32 restaurants, and basic services such as dry cleaners, hair cutting, and child care. Office space for small businesses, such as local real estate and insurance offices, doctors and dentists, and similar uses, also may be found in such locations. 223.15 Unlike Main Street Retail Corridors, the Neighborhood Commercial Centers include both auto- oriented centers and pedestrian-oriented shopping areas. Examples include Penn Branch Shopping Center on Pennsylvania Avenue, SE and the Spring Valley Shopping Center on Massachusetts Avenue, NW. New development and redevelopment within Neighborhood Commercial Areas must be managed to conserve the economic viability of these areas while allowing additional development that complements existing uses. 223.16 Multi-Neighborhood Centers: Multi-neighborhood centers contain many of the same activities as neighborhood centers but in greater depth and variety. Their service area is typically one to three miles. These centers are generally found at major intersections and along key transit routes. These centers might include supermarkets, general merchandise stores, drug stores, restaurants, specialty shops, apparel stores, and a variety of service-oriented businesses. These centers also may include office space for small 44 businesses, although their primary function remains retail trade. 223.17 Examples of multi-neighborhood business centers include Hechinger Mall, Brentwood Shopping Center, and Skyland Shopping Center. Mixed-use infill development at these centers should be encouraged to provide new retail and service uses, and additional housing and job opportunities. Transit improvements to these centers are also desirable. 223.18 Regional Centers: Regional centers have the largest range of commercial functions outside the Central Employment Area and are likely to have major department stores, many specialty shops, concentrations of restaurants, movies and other leisure or entertainment facilities. They typically draw patrons from across the city, as well as patrons from nearby suburban areas. A large office component is also associated with regional centers. As with Multi-Neighborhood Centers, infill development at Regional Centers should provide new retail, entertainment, service uses, additional housing, and employment opportunities where feasible. 223.19 These centers are generally located along major arterials and are served by transit, and typically generate significant demand for parking. Off-street parking may be provided on a cooperative shared basis within the area, using both self-contained and nearby commercial parking lots and garages. Heights and densities in regional centers should be appropriate to the scale and function of development in adjoining communities, and should be further guided by policies in the Land Use Element and the Area Elements. Examples of regional centers include Friendship Heights and Georgetown. 223.20 Central Employment Area: The Central Employment Area is the business and retail heart of the District and the metropolitan area. It has the widest variety of commercial uses, including but not limited to major government and corporate offices; retail, cultural, and entertainment uses; and hotels, restaurants, and other hospitality uses. The Central Employment Area draws patrons, workers, and visitors from across the region. The Comprehensive Plan’s Land Use and Economic Development Elements, and the Central Washington Area Element and Anacostia Waterfront Element provide additional guidance, policies and actions related to the Central Employment Area. 223.21 Other Areas The Generalized Policy Map also identifies parks and open space, federal lands, Downtown Washington, and major institutional land uses. The fact that these areas are not designated as Conservation, Enhancement, or Change does not mean they are exempt from the policies of the Comprehensive Plan or CITYWIDE ELEMENTS COMPREHENSIVE PLAN DISTRICT ELEMENTS ADOPTED 12/19/06 P. 1-33 will remain static. Park and open space will be conserved and carefully managed in the future. Federal lands are called out to acknowledge the District’s limited jurisdiction over them, but are still discussed in the text of the District Elements. Downtown includes its own set of conservation, enhancement, and change areas, described in more detail in the Central Washington Area Element. Much of the institutional land on the map represents colleges and universities; change and infill can be expected on each campus consistent with campus plans. Other institutional sites likewise may see new buildings or facilities added. 45 Policies in the Land Use Element and the Educational Facilities Element address the compatibility of such uses with surrounding neighborhoods. 223.22 [Photo Caption: Barracks Row is a Main Street Mixed Use corridor.] [Photo Caption: Penn Branch shopping center is a neighborhood commercial center.] [Photo Caption: Brentwood Shopping Center is an example of a multi-neighborhood commercial center.] [Photo Caption: Friendship Heights is a regional commercial center.] [Photo Caption: Downtown retail in the Central Employment Area.] 2.4.2 Future Land Use Map and Categories 224 Purpose of the Land Use Map The Future Land Use Map is part of the adopted Comprehensive Plan and carries the same legal weight as the Plan document itself. The Map uses color-coded categories to express public policy on future land uses across the city. Preparation of this map is explicitly required by DC Law; its purpose is to “represent the land use policies set forth in the proposed Land Use Element,” using “standardized colors for planning maps.” (1-246, D.C. Code 224.1 [BEGIN TEXT BOX] The District’s Future Land Use Map Maps showing the general distribution and character of future land uses in the city have been an essential part of the Comprehensive Plan for over half a century. Both the 1950 and 1967 Comprehensive Plan for the National Capital depicted “high density”, “moderate density”, and “low density” residential neighborhoods. These Plans further defined “Local Commercial” areas along many corridor streets, a “Downtown Commercial” area, and a “Central Federal Employment Area”. The Maps also called out hospitals, universities, industrial areas, and federal installations. 224.2 The District portion of the 1984 Comprehensive Plan—the first Plan of the Home Rule Era—was initially adopted without a Land Use Map. A set of four large maps was adopted in 1985, along with the Land Use Element itself. In the years that followed, the four maps were consolidated into two maps—a Generalized Land Use Map and a Generalized Land Use Policy Map. 224.3 An illustrative “paintbrush” format, reminiscent of those used in the 1950 and 1967 Plans, was initially used for the 1985 Land Use Map. This format was rejected as being too imprecise and “blob-like.” In subsequent years it was replaced by a map with clearly defined edges. The Comprehensive Plan text stipulated that streets and street names be displayed on the map to ensure its legibility. Its 15 land use categories were defined in broad terms—typical uses were described, but no density or intensity ranges were assigned. 224.4 [END TEXT BOX] CITYWIDE ELEMENTS COMPREHENSIVE PLAN DISTRICT ELEMENTS ADOPTED 12/19/06 P. 1-34 Definitions of Land Use Categories Residential Categories Four residential categories appear on the Future Land Use Map, as follows: 224.5 Low Density Residential This designation is used to define the District’s single family neighborhoods. Single family detached and semi detached housing units with front, back, and side yards are the predominant uses. The R-1-A, R- 1- 46 B, and R-2 Zone Districts are generally consistent with the Low Density Residential land use category, although other zones may apply. 224.6 [Photo Caption: Low Density Residential] Moderate Density Residential This designation is used to define the District’s row house neighborhoods, as well as its low-rise garden apartment complexes. The designation also applies to areas characterized by a mix of single family homes, 2-4 unit buildings, row houses, and low-rise apartment buildings. In some of the older inner city neighborhoods with this designation, there may also be existing multi-story apartments, many built decades ago when the areas were zoned for more dense uses (or were not zoned at all The R-3, R-4, R- 5-A Zone districts are generally consistent with the Moderate Density Residential category; the R-5- B district and other zones may also apply in some locations. 224.7 [Photo Caption: Moderate Density Residential] Medium Density Residential This designation is used to define neighborhoods or areas where mid-rise (4-7 stories) apartment buildings are the predominant use. Pockets of low and moderate density housing may exist within these areas. The Medium Density Residential designation also may apply to taller residential buildings surrounded by large areas of permanent open space. The R-5-B and R-5-C Zone districts are generally consistent with the Medium Density designation, although other zones may apply. 224.8 [Photo Caption: Medium Density Residential] High Density Residential This designation is used to define neighborhoods and corridors where high-rise (8 stories or more) apartment buildings are the predominant use. Pockets of less dense housing may exist within these areas. The corresponding Zone districts are generally R-5-D and R-5-E, although other zones may apply. 224.9 [Photo Caption: High Density Residential] Commercial Categories Four commercial categories appear on the Map, listed below. Although housing is permitted in all of these categories, the predominant use is commercial. A separate category (Mixed Use, defined on Page 2-32) is used to identify areas where the mixing of commercial and residential uses is strongly encouraged: 224.10 Low Density Commercial This designation is used to define shopping and service areas that are generally low in scale and character. Retail, office, and service businesses are the predominant uses. Areas with this designation range from CITYWIDE ELEMENTS COMPREHENSIVE PLAN DISTRICT ELEMENTS ADOPTED 12/19/06 P. 1-35 small business districts that draw primarily from the surrounding neighborhoods to larger business districts uses that draw from a broader market area. Their common feature is that they are comprised primarily of one- to three-story commercial buildings. The corresponding Zone districts are generally C- 1 and C-2-A, although other districts may apply. 224.11 [Photo Caption: Low Density Commercial] Moderate Density Commercial This designation is used to define shopping and service areas that are somewhat more intense in scale and character than the low-density commercial areas. Retail, office, and service businesses are the predominant uses. Areas with this designation range from small business districts that draw primarily from the surrounding neighborhoods to larger business districts uses that draw from a broader market 47 area. Buildings are larger and/or taller than those in low density commercial areas but generally do not exceed five stories in height. The corresponding Zone districts are generally C-2-A, C-2-B, and C-3- A, although other districts may apply. 224.12 [Photo Caption: Moderate Density Commercial] Medium Density Commercial This designation is used to define shopping and service areas that are somewhat more intense in scale and character than the moderate-density commercial areas. Retail, office, and service businesses are the predominant uses. Areas with this designation generally draw from a citywide market area. Buildings are generally larger and/or taller than those in moderate density commercial areas but generally do not exceed eight stories in height. The corresponding Zone districts are generally C-2-B, C-2-C, C-3-A, and C-3- B, although other districts may apply. 224.13 [Photo Caption: Medium Density Commercial] High Density Commercial This designation is used to define the central employment district of the city and other major office employment centers on the downtown perimeter. It is characterized by office and mixed office/retail buildings greater than eight stories in height, although many lower scale buildings (including historic buildings) are interspersed. The corresponding Zone districts are generally C-2-C, C-3-C, C-4, and C- 5, although other districts may apply. 224.14 [Photo Caption: High Density Commercial] Production, Distribution, and Repair (PDR) The Production, Distribution, and Repair (PDR) category is used to define areas characterized by manufacturing, warehousing, wholesale and distribution centers, transportation services, food services, printers and publishers, tourism support services, and commercial, municipal, and utility activities which may require substantial buffering from noise air pollution- and light-sensitive uses such as housing. This category is also used to denote railroad rights-of-way, switching and maintenance yards, bus garages, and similar uses related to the movement of freight, such as truck terminals. A variety of Zone districts apply within PDR areas, recognizing the different intensities of use and impacts generated by various PDR activities. The corresponding Zone districts are generally CM-1, CM-2, CM-3, and M, although other districts may apply. The present density and height limits set by these districts are expected to remain for the foreseeable future. 224.15 [Photo Caption: Production, Distribution, and Repair] CITYWIDE ELEMENTS COMPREHENSIVE PLAN DISTRICT ELEMENTS ADOPTED 12/19/06 P. 1-36 Public and Institutional Categories Four public and institutional land use categories appear on the Map, as follows: 224.16 Federal This designation includes land and facilities owned, occupied and used by the federal government, excluding parks and open space. Uses include military bases, federal government buildings, the International Chancery Center, federal hospitals, and similar federal government activities. The “Federal” category generally denotes ownership rather than use. Land with this designation is generally not subject to zoning. In the event federal interests on any given federal site terminate, zoning for these areas should be established in a manner that is consistent with Comprehensive Plan policies. 224.17 [Photo Caption: Federal] Local Public Facilities 48 This designation includes land and facilities occupied and used by the District of Columbia government or other local government agencies (such as WMATA excluding parks and open space. Uses include public schools including charter schools, public hospitals, government office complexes, and similar local government activities. Because of the map scale, local public facilities smaller than one acre—including some of the District’s libraries, police and fire stations, and similar uses—may not appear on the Map. Zoning designations vary depending on surrounding uses. 224.18 [Photo Caption: Local Public Facilities] Institutional This designation includes land and facilities occupied and used by colleges and universities, large private schools, hospitals, religious organizations, and similar institutions. Smaller institutional uses such as churches are generally not mapped, unless they are located on sites that are several acres in size. Zoning designations vary depending on surrounding uses. 224.19 [Photo Caption: Institutional] Parks, Recreation, and Open Space This designation includes the federal and District park systems, including the National Parks, the circles and squares of the L’Enfant city and District neighborhoods, the National Mall, settings for significant commemorative works, certain federal buildings such as the White House and the US Capitol grounds, and museums, and District-operated parks and associated recreation centers. It also includes permanent open space uses such as cemeteries, open space associated with utilities such as the Dalecarlia and McMillan Reservoirs, and open space along highways such as Suitland Parkway. This category includes a mix of passive open space (for resource conservation and habitat protection) and active open space (for recreation Because of the map scale, parks smaller than one acre—including many of the triangles along the city’s avenues—may not appear on the Map. Zoning designations for these areas vary. The federal parklands are generally unzoned, and District parklands tend to be zoned the same as surrounding land uses. 224.20 [Photo Caption: Parks, Recreation and Open Space] Mixed Use Categories The Future Land Use Map indicates areas where the mixing of two or more land uses is encouraged. The particular combination of uses desired in a given area is depicted in striped patterns, with stripe colors CITYWIDE ELEMENTS COMPREHENSIVE PLAN DISTRICT ELEMENTS ADOPTED 12/19/06 P. 1-37 corresponding to the categories defined on the previous pages. The Mixed Use category generally applies in the following three circumstances: 224.21 (a) Established, pedestrian-oriented commercial areas which also include substantial amounts of housing, typically on the upper stories of buildings with ground floor retail or office uses b) Commercial corridors or districts which may not contain substantial amounts of housing today, but where more housing is desired in the future. The pattern envisioned for such areas is typically one of pedestrian-oriented streets, with ground floor retail or office uses and upper story housing c) Large sites (generally greater than 10 acres in size where opportunities for multiple uses exist 49 but a plan dictating the precise location of these uses has yet to be prepared. The general density and intensity of development within a given Mixed Use area is determined by the specific mix of uses shown. If the desired outcome is to emphasize one use over the other (for example, ground floor retail with three stories of housing above the Future Land Use Map may note the dominant use by showing it at a slightly higher density than the other use in the mix (in this case, “Moderate Density Residential/ Low Density Commercial The Comprehensive Plan Area Elements may also provide detail on the specific mix of uses envisioned. 224.21 It should also be acknowledged that because of the scale of the Future Land Use Map and the fine- grained pattern of land use in older parts of the city, many of the areas shown purely as “Commercial” may also contain other uses, including housing. Likewise, some of the areas shown as purely “Residential” contain existing incidental commercial uses such as corner stores or gas stations, or established institutional uses such as churches. The “Mixed Use” designation is intended primarily for larger areas where no single use predominates today, or areas where multiple uses are specifically encouraged in the future. 224.22 A variety of zoning designations are used in Mixed Use areas, depending on the combination of uses, densities, and intensities. The city has developed a number of designations specifically for mixed use areas (such as SP-1, SP-2, CR, and the Waterfront districts Residential uses are permitted in all of the commercial zones, however, so many Mixed Use areas may have commercial zoning. 224.23 Guidelines for Using the Generalized Policy Map and the Future Land Use Map The Generalized Policy Map and Future Land Use Map are intended to provide generalized guides for development and conservation decisions. Several important parameters, defined below, apply to their use and interpretation. 224.24 (a) The Future Land Use Map is not a zoning map. Whereas zoning maps are parcel-specific, and establish detailed requirements for setbacks, height, use, parking, and other attributes, the Future Land Use Map does not follow parcel boundaries and its categories do not specify allowable uses or dimensional standards. By definition, the Map is to be interpreted broadly b) The Future Land Use Map is a generalized depiction of intended uses in the horizon year of the Comprehensive Plan, roughly 20 years in the future. It is not an “existing land use map,” although in many cases future uses in an area may be the same as those that exist today c) The densities within any given area on the Future Land Use Map reflect all contiguous properties on a block—there may be individual buildings that are higher or lower than these ranges within each area. Similarly, the land use category definitions describe the general character of development in each area, citing typical building heights (in stories) as appropriate. It should be noted that the granting of CITYWIDE ELEMENTS COMPREHENSIVE PLAN DISTRICT ELEMENTS ADOPTED 12/19/06 P. 1-38 density bonuses (for example, through Planned Unit Developments) may result in heights that exceed the typical ranges cited here d) The zoning of any given area should be guided by the Future Land Use Map, interpreted in conjunction with the text of the Comprehensive Plan, including the citywide elements and the area elements, as well as approved Small Area Plans e) The designation of an area with a particular land use category does not necessarily mean that the most intense zoning district described in the land use definitions is automatically permitted. A range of densities and intensities applies within each category, and the use of different zone districts within each category should reinforce this range. There are more than twice as many zone districts (about 30, 50 plus more than a dozen overlay zones) as there are Comprehensive Plan land use categories. For example, there are at least three zone districts corresponding to “Low Density Residential” and three zone districts corresponding to “Moderate Density Residential.” Multiple zones should continue to be used to distinguish the different types of low- or moderate-density residential development which may occur within each area f) Some zone districts may be compatible with more than one Comprehensive Plan Future Land Use Map designation. As an example, the existing C-2-A zone is consistent with both the Low Density Commercial and the Moderate Density Commercial designation, depending on the prevailing character of the area and the adjacent uses. A correspondence table indicating which zones are “clearly consistent”, “potentially consistent” and “inconsistent” with the Comprehensive Plan categories should be prepared to assist in Comprehensive Plan implementation and future zoning actions (see Action LU-4.3B g) The intent of the Future Land Use Map is to show use rather than ownership. However, in a number of cases, ownership is displayed to note the District’s limited jurisdiction. Specifically, non-park federal facilities are shown as “Federal” even though the actual uses include housing and industry (e.g Bolling Air Force Base offices (e.g the Federal Triangle hospitals (e.g Walter Reed and other activities. Similarly, the “Local Public” designation includes high-impact uses such as solid waste transfer stations and stadiums, as well as low-impact uses such as schools. Other maps in the Comprehensive Plan are used to show the specific types of public uses present in each area h) The Map does not show density or intensity on institutional and local public sites. If a change in use occurs on these sites in the future (for example, a school becomes surplus or is redeveloped the new designations should be comparable in density or intensity to those in the vicinity, unless otherwise stated in the Comprehensive Plan Area Elements or an approved Campus Plan i) Streets and public rights-of-way are not an explicit land use category on the Future Land Use Map. Within any given area, the streets that pass through are assigned the same designation as the adjacent uses j) Urban renewal plans remain in effect for parts of the District of Columbia, including Shaw, Downtown, and Fort Lincoln. These plans remain in effect and their controlling provisions must be considered as land use and zoning decisions are made k) Finally, the Future Land Use Map and the Generalized Policy Map can be amended. They are not intended to freeze future development patterns for the next 20 years. The Comprehensive Plan is intended to be a dynamic document that is periodically updated in response to the changing needs of the city. Requests to amend the maps can be made by residents, property owners, developers, and the District itself. In all cases, such changes require formal public hearings before the DC Council, and CITYWIDE ELEMENTS COMPREHENSIVE PLAN DISTRICT ELEMENTS ADOPTED 12/19/06 P. 1-39 ample opportunities for formal public input. The process for Comprehensive Plan amendments is described in the Implementation Element. CITYWIDE ELEMENTS COMPREHENSIVE PLAN DISTRICT ELEMENTS ADOPTED 12/19/06 P. 1-40 CHAPTER 3 LAND USE ELEMENT Overview 300 The Land Use Element is the cornerstone of the Comprehensive Plan. It establishes the basic policies guiding the physical form of the city, and provides direction on a range of development, conservation, and land use compatibility issues. The Element describes the balancing of priorities that must take place in order to accommodate a multiplicity of land uses within the boundaries of the District of Columbia. 300.1 51 The critical land use issues facing the District of Columbia are addressed in this element. These include: Promoting neighborhood conservation Creating and maintaining successful neighborhoods Strengthening Downtown Enhancing neighborhood commercial districts and centers Balancing competing demands for finite land resources Directing growth and new development to achieve economic vitality while minimizing adverse impacts on residential areas and open space Siting challenging land uses More than any other part of the Comprehensive Plan, this Element lays out the policies through which the city will accommodate growth and change while conserving and enhancing its neighborhoods, commercial districts, and other areas. Because the Land Use Element integrates the policies and objectives of all the other District Elements, it should be given greater weight than the other elements as competing policies in different elements are balanced. 300.2 Although the District of Columbia was almost fully developed out by 1960, the demand for land for housing and jobs has continued to fuel land use change. The changing needs of the federal government, private industry, and the city’s institutions still shape the landscape on a daily basis. The city’s aging building stock still requires refurbishment and replacement. The renewed popularity of city living generates the need for more housing and new amenities. 300.3 Land use changes have the potential to make the city more vibrant, economically healthy, exciting, and even more environmentally sustainable than it is today. But without proper direction and coordinated public investment, change can also be adverse. The Land Use Element strives for positive outcomes in all parts of the city by setting policies on appropriate uses and densities, and describing how different uses can successfully co-exist. 300.4 The Element is divided into several sections. The first section provides basic data on land use and density in the District of Columbia. Subsequent sections of the element present policies and actions, organized under the following major topic headings Shaping the City Creating and Maintaining Successful Neighborhoods Balancing Competing Demands for Land. 300.5 The definitions of Land Use categories and description of the Future Land Use Map and Generalized Policies Map may be found in Chapter 2 (Framework Element CITYWIDE ELEMENTS COMPREHENSIVE PLAN DISTRICT ELEMENTS ADOPTED 12/19/06 P. 1-41 Land Use Profile of the District of Columbia 301 The District of Columbia comprises 69 square miles, including approximately eight square miles of water and 61 square miles of land. Land use patterns, illustrated in Map 3.1, reveal an expansive city “core” of about four square miles centered around the open spaces of the federal city. The core is surrounded by an inner ring of moderate to high density residential and mixed use neighborhoods, extending west to Georgetown, north to Columbia Heights and Petworth, east across Capitol Hill, and south to the Anacostia River and Near Southwest. Beyond the inner ring is an outer ring of less dense development, characterized largely by single family housing and garden apartments. The two rings generally correspond to historic development patterns, with most of the inner ring developed prior to 1910 and the outer ring developed after 1910. 301.1 52 The impact of the city’s transportation network on land use patterns is apparent in Map 3.1. Most of the commercial and higher density development beyond the core of the city hugs radial avenues like Connecticut Avenue NW and Pennsylvania Avenue SE. Most of the District’s industrial development follows the railroad corridors running from Union Station east along New York Avenue and north to Silver Spring. The historic connection between transportation and land use continues to shape the city today, with Metrorail station areas emerging as the city’s newest activity centers. 301.2 Map 3.1 reveals other distinctive land use patterns. The city’s open space networks, particularly those along Rock Creek and the Potomac and Anacostia Rivers, are apparent. Large institutional uses— including some 2,000 acres of colleges, universities, hospitals, seminaries, and similar uses across the city—are visible. Federal enclaves beyond the core of the city, such as Bolling Air Force Base, the St. Elizabeths Hospital Campus, Walter Reed Hospital, and the Armed Forces Retirement Home, appear prominently. Many of the federal and institutional uses are located in areas that are otherwise residential in character. While this creates the potential for land use conflicts, these uses are also important open space buffers, job centers, community anchors, and resources for the surrounding neighborhoods. 301.3 [Photo caption: 7th Street NE rowhouses under construction] [INSERT Map 3.1: Existing Land Use 2005 301.4] Table 3.1 indicates the existing acreage in different land uses in each of the city’s ten Planning Areas. Figure 3.1 shows the location of these Planning Areas. The table shows both similarities and differences between Areas. Both the “inner ring” and “outer ring” neighborhoods generally contain 30 to 40 percent of their land areas in residential uses. On the other hand, residential uses represent less than two percent of Central Washington and less than 10 percent of the Anacostia Waterfront. About 25 percent of the District consists of road rights-of-way, although only about half of this acreage actually consists of the paved streets themselves. For instance, road rights of way constitute 39 percent of Capitol Hill, but most of this land consists of landscaped or bricked front “yards” along streets with exceptionally wide rightsof- way. 301.5 Despite the significant number of jobs in the city, commercial uses represent less than five percent of the city’s land area, and industrial uses represent just one percent. Commercial uses represent about 16 percent of the land area in Central Washington, but less than two percent of the land area in Far Southeast/ Southwest. Many of the District’s jobs are associated with federal facilities and institutional uses, which together make up about 13 percent of its land area. Institutional lands appear throughout the city, but are especially prevalent in the three Northwest Planning Areas and in Upper Northeast. 301.6 [INSERT Figure 3.1: Planning Areas (key map)] CITYWIDE ELEMENTS COMPREHENSIVE PLAN DISTRICT ELEMENTS ADOPTED 12/19/06 P. 1-42 Table 3.1: Acres of Existing Land Use by Planning Area, 2005 301.7 Capitol Hill Central Washington Far Northeast &amp;amp; Southeast Far Southeast &amp;amp; Southwest Lower Anacostia Waterfront/ Near 53 Southwest Mid City Near Northwest Rock Creek East Rock Creek West Upper Northeast Citywide Percent Road Rights-of- Way 759.0 898.8 1,337.8 906.1 477.5 628.0 715.9 1,311.0 1,760.5 1,223.1 10,017.7 25.5% Single Family Detached Homes 6.2 0.1 775.2 163.8 7.3 15.5 83.8 918.9 2,324.4 641.0 4,936.2 12.6% Single Family Attached Homes Row Houses 520.2 9.7 641.2 327.8 30.5 496.8 339.9 606.1 290.0 611.4 3,873.6 9.9% Low-Rise Apartments 43.1 9.7 435.9 555.2 106.1 136.2 109.7 85.1 185.4 189.3 1,855.7 4.7% High-Rise Apartments 3.9 25.8 19.9 43.7 25.6 59.5 65.4 24.7 109.2 24.6 402.3 1.0% Commercial 97.2 447.9 128.9 62.8 122.0 144.0 220.1 106.0 170.1 295.6 1,794.6 4.7% Industrial 5.2 16.4 12.2 5.5 42.2 20.6 5.7 15.7 0.0 294.9 418.4 1.1% Local Public Facilities 72.1 47.0 154.0 441.1 46.7 53.8 75.4 131.3 67.5 102.0 1,190.9 3.0% Federal Facilities (excl. parks) 47.3 480.6 4.4 1,067.3 408.6 1.3 1.1 412.0 282.6 75.8 2,781.0 7.1% Institutional 42.1 66.6 71.2 117.4 22.4 141.7 248.6 163.3 658.9 729.8 2,262.0 5.8% Permanent Open Space 295.8 678.5 1,321.5 729.0 532.8 140.9 354.4 877.9 2,011.3 1,038.1 7,980.2 20.3% Rail, Communication, Utilities 0.7 36.0 223.5 74.5 11.1 96.8 6.3 83.2 3.8 320.9 856.8 2.2% Vacant 65.6 58.2 178.9 188.2 50.9 36.0 32.6 22.2 111.2 99.0 842.8 2.1% TOTAL LAND 1,958.4 2,776.4 5,304.6 4,686.8 1,883.7 1,971.1 2,258.9 4,757.4 7,982.2 5,645.5 39,225.0 100 .0 Water 117.0 509.2 135.5 1,791.4 1,294.9 45.8 239.4 18.9 313.0 89.1 4,554.2 TOTAL 2,075.4 3,284.5 5,440.1 6,473.8 3,178.6 2,016.9 2,498.3 4,776.3 8,287.7 5,734.6 43,766.2 Maps 3.2 and 3.3 show estimated population and employment density in the city and close-in suburbs as of 2005. The data is based on the traffic analysis zones used by the Metropolitan Washington Council of Governments for transportation modeling. Map 3.2 again illustrates the “ring” of fairly dense neighborhoods around the city center, and the denser residential development along major corridors like Connecticut Avenue NW and 14th Street NW. It also shows areas of fairly dense development east of the Anacostia River, primarily associated with large low-rise garden apartment complexes in Far Southeast. On the other hand, areas like Woodridge, Burrville, and Shepherd Park have low population densities, in some cases even lower than the adjacent neighborhoods in suburban Maryland. 301.7 Map 3.3 shows that employment is highly concentrated in Central Washington. Nearly 60 percent of the city’s jobs are located within this area. Beyond the city center, other major employment centers include the universities and federal enclaves, the New York Avenue industrial corridor, the West End, the Georgetown waterfront, and several corridors in Upper Northwest. Large concentrations of 54 employment also appear beyond the city limits, in Downtown Bethesda and Silver Spring, and in Rosslyn, Crystal City, the Pentagon area, and Alexandria. 301.8 CITYWIDE ELEMENTS COMPREHENSIVE PLAN DISTRICT ELEMENTS ADOPTED 12/19/06 P. 1-43 [PULLQUOTE: Nearly 60 percent of the city’s jobs are located in Central Washington.

Its focus is on the specific areas or types of areas within the city where change is most likely to take place. The section begins with guiding policies for the center of the city. It then turns to the large sites around Washington where future changes are envisioned. This is followed by a discussion of the opportunities for change along the city’s corridors and around its transit station areas. Policies for neighborhood infill development also are included. 303.1 LU-1.1 Strengthening the Core 304 Key to the Comprehensive Plan is the transformation of the city’s core (generally referred to throughout the Plan as “Central Washington”) into a more cohesive urban center. The six or seven distinct commercial districts that make up Central Washington already comprise the third largest central business district in the United States, after New York and Chicago. Yet, with a few notable exceptions, much of the area lacks the dynamic “24/7” character that defines other great world capitals. For more than 35 years, Washington’s planners have aspired to create a “living downtown”—a place alive with housing, theaters, department stores, and restaurants as well as the vast expanse of office space that defines the central city today. Recent developments around Gallery Place and the Penn Quarter show that these efforts are finally paying off, but the area’s full potential has yet to be realized. 304.1 55 CITYWIDE ELEMENTS COMPREHENSIVE PLAN DISTRICT ELEMENTS ADOPTED 12/19/06 P. 1-44 Between 2005 and 2025, approximately 30 percent of the District of Columbia’s future housing growth and 70 percent of its job growth will occur within the urban core of the city and adjacent close-in areas along the Anacostia River. This growth must be accommodated in a way that protects the area’s historic texture, including the street and open space frameworks established by the L’Enfant and McMillan Plans, the 1910 height limit, and the vistas and monumental spaces that define the central city. Infill and redevelopment will take place within the established business districts west of 5th Street NW, but a majority of the central city’s future growth will be achieved through redevelopment of areas on its east side. 304.2 Two areas, each over 300 acres in size, are already emerging as the new frontiers for central city growth. The first includes land in the triangle bounded by New York Avenue, Massachusetts Avenue NW, and the CSX railroad, along with adjacent lands around the New York Avenue Metro station. The second area includes the South Capitol corridor and Near Southeast, including the site of the Washington Nationals Baseball Park and the adjoining Southeast Federal Center and waterfront area. Whereas much of Central Washington was redeveloped with single-purpose (office) uses during the second half of the 20th century, these two areas are envisioned as mixed use centers, including housing as well as employment. These areas represent the most promising setting in the entire region to accommodate Metropolitan Washington’s next generation of urban living. 304.3 As the urban core expands, reinvestment in established business districts such as the Golden Triangle, the Downtown Core, and the Near Southwest also must continue. These areas will be modernized, better connected to one another, and developed with new infill uses and public improvements. Large sites such as the Old Convention Center provide opportunities for spectacular new civic focal points while smaller sites present the opportunity for new retail, housing, and office development. 304.4 Additional discussions of planning issues in these areas may be found in the Central Washington Area Element and the Lower Anacostia Waterfront/ Near Southwest Area Element. These chapters should be consulted for specific policies and actions. 304.5 Policy LU-1.1.1: Sustaining a Strong City Center Provide for the continued vitality of Central Washington as a thriving business, government, retail, financial, hospitality, cultural, and residential center. Promote continued reinvestment in central city buildings, infrastructure, and public spaces; continued preservation and restoration of historic resources; and continued efforts to create safe, attractive, and pedestrian-friendly environments. 304.6 Policy LU-1.1.2: “Greater” Downtown Promote the perception of Downtown Washington as a series of connected business districts, including Metro Center/ Retail Core, Golden Triangle/K Street, Federal Triangle, Northwest Rectangle, Gallery Place/ Penn Quarter, Downtown East/ Judiciary Square, Mount Vernon District, NoMA, Near Southwest/L’Enfant Plaza, South Capitol, and the Southeast Federal Center. The traditional definition of Downtown (roughly bounded by 16th Street, the National Mall, and Massachusetts Avenue) does not 56 fully convey the geographic extent of Washington’s Central Business District, or the many unique activities it supports. 304.7 [PULLQUOTE: The traditional definition of Downtown (roughly bounded by 16th Street, the National Mall, and Massachusetts Avenue) does not fully convey the geographic extent of Washington’s Central Business District, or the many unique activities it supports.] Policy LU-1.1.3: Central Employment Area Continue the joint federal/District designation of a “Central Employment Area” (CEA) within the District of Columbia. The CEA shall include existing “core” federal facilities such as the US Capitol Building, CITYWIDE ELEMENTS COMPREHENSIVE PLAN DISTRICT ELEMENTS ADOPTED 12/19/06 P. 1-45 the White House, and the Supreme Court, and most of the legislative, judicial, and executive administrative headquarters of the United States Government. Additionally, the CEA shall include the greatest concentration of the city’s private office development, and higher density mixed land uses, including commercial/ retail, hotel, residential, and entertainment uses. Given federally-imposed height limits, the scarcity of vacant land in the core of the city, and the importance of protecting historic resources, the CEA may include additional land necessary to support economic growth and federal expansion. The CEA may be used to guide the District’s economic development initiatives, and may be incorporated in its planning and building standards (for example, parking requirements) to reinforce urban character. The CEA is also important because it is part of the “point system” used by the General Services Administration to establish federal leases. The boundaries of the CEA are shown in Figure 3.2. 304.8 Policy LU-1.1.4: Appropriate Uses in the CEA Ensure that land within the Central Employment Area is used in a manner which reflects the area’s national importance, its historic and cultural significance, and its role as the center of the metropolitan region. Federal siting guidelines and District zoning regulations should promote the use of this area with high-value land uses that enhance its image as the seat of the national government and the center of the District of Columbia, and that make the most efficient possible use of its transportation facilities. 304.9 Policy LU-1.1.5: Urban Mixed Use Neighborhoods Encourage new central city mixed use neighborhoods combining high-density residential, office, retail, cultural, and open space uses in the following areas 1) Mt Vernon Triangle (2) North of Massachusetts Avenue (NoMA 3) Downtown East (4) South Capitol Street corridor/ Stadium area (5) Near Southeast/ Navy Yard The location of these areas is shown in the Central Washington and Lower Anacostia Waterfront/ Near Southwest Area Elements. Land use regulations and design standards for these areas should ensure that they are developed as attractive pedestrian-oriented neighborhoods, with high-quality architecture and public spaces. Housing, including affordable housing, is particularly encouraged and should be a vital component of the future land use mix. 304.10 57 Policy LU-1.1.6: Central Employment Area Historic Resources Preserve the scale and character of the Central Employment Area’s historic resources, including the streets, vistas, and public spaces of the L’Enfant and McMillan Plans as well as individual historic structures and sites. Future development must be sensitive to the area’s historic character and should enhance important reminders of the city’s past. 304.11 Please consult the Historic Preservation and Urban Design Elements for related policies. Policy LU-1.1.7: Central Employment Area Edges Support the retention of the established residential neighborhoods adjacent to the Central Employment Area. Appropriate building setbacks, lot coverage standards, and a stepping down in land use intensity and building height shall be required along the edges of the CEA to protect the integrity and historic scale of adjacent neighborhoods and to avoid creating sharp visual distinctions between existing and new structures. 304.12 Please refer to the Urban Design Element for additional guidance on the appropriate transition of intensity at the edges of Downtown. CITYWIDE ELEMENTS COMPREHENSIVE PLAN DISTRICT ELEMENTS ADOPTED 12/19/06 P. 1-46 Action LU-1.1-A: Central Employment Area Boundary Encourage the National Capital Planning Commission to amend the boundary of the CEA depicted in the Federal Elements to match the boundary shown in the District Elements of the Comprehensive Plan. 304.13 Action LU-1.1-B: Downtown Action Agenda Update the 2000 Downtown Action Agenda to reflect changing conditions, priorities, and projections (the Agenda is Downtown’s strategic plan for future growth, improvement, and conservation The revised Agenda should define Downtown more broadly to include the multiple business districts that comprise the Central Employment Area. 304.14 More specific policies for this area are contained in the Central Washington Area Element and the Lower Anacostia Waterfront/ Near Southwest Area Element. [INSERT Figure 3.2: Central Employment Area 304.15] LU-1.2 Large Sites and the City Fabric 305 During the next 20 years, about 15 percent of Washington’s housing growth and 10 percent of its job growth will take place on ten large sites outside of the Central Employment Area. The large sites include properties in federal ownership, District ownership, and private ownership. The status of each site varies; redevelopment on a few is imminent, but may be over a decade away on others. Some still contain vital, active uses. Others have been dormant for years. 305.1 [PULLQUOTE: During the next 20 years, about 15 percent of Washington’s housing growth and 10 percent of its job growth will take place on about ten large sites outside of the Central Employment Area. The large sites include properties in federal ownership, District ownership, and private ownership.] Four of the ten sites are owned (at least in part) by the federal government. Consequently, policies in the District Elements for these lands are not binding, and are intended only to express the District’s vision for these properties. The District will work collaboratively with the federal government in future planning and development decisions to ensure that development on these sites is compatible with adjacent neighborhoods and furthers the goals and policies of the District Elements. 305.2 58 The large sites are shown in Map 3.4 and are listed in Table 3.2 below. The Area Elements should be consulted for a profile of each site and specific policies for its future use. The policies in this section focus on broader issues that apply to all sites. As shown on Map 3.4, several of the sites fall within the boundaries of the Anacostia Waterfront Initiative, an economic revitalization and environmental protection program now being implemented by the Anacostia Waterfront Corporation. 305.3 CITYWIDE ELEMENTS COMPREHENSIVE PLAN DISTRICT ELEMENTS ADOPTED 12/19/06 P. 1-47 Table 3.2: Large Sites*305.4 Site Acres Consult the following Area Element for more detail: Armed Forces Retirement Home 276 Rock Creek East DC Village 167 Far SE/ SW Fort Lincoln (remainder) 80 Upper Northeast Kenilworth-Parkside 60 Far NE/SE McMillan Sand Filtration Site 25 Mid-City Poplar Point 60 Lower Anacostia Waterfront/ Near Southwest Reservation 13 67 Capitol Hill St. Elizabeths Hospital 336 Far SE/ SW Southwest Waterfront 45 Lower Anacostia Waterfront/ Near Southwest Walter Reed Army Medical Center 113 Rock Creek East The 55-acre Southeast Federal Center does not appear on the list, as it is within the Central Employment Area.

[INSERT Map 3.4: Large Sites. {AWI boundary added to map}] [Photo Caption: Sites like Poplar Point offer opportunities for exciting new waterfront development and parks.] Policy LU-1.2.1: Reuse of Large Publicly-Owned Sites Recognize the potential for large, government-owned properties to supply needed community services, create local housing and employment opportunities, remove barriers between neighborhoods, provide large and significant new parks, enhance waterfront access, and improve and stabilize the city’s neighborhoods. 305.6 Policy LU-1.2.2: Mix of Uses on Large Sites Ensure that the mix of new uses on large redeveloped sites is compatible with adjacent uses and provides benefits to surrounding neighborhoods and to the city as a whole. The particular mix of uses on any given site should be generally indicated on the Comprehensive Plan Future Land Use Map and more fully described in the Comprehensive Plan Area Elements. Zoning on such sites should be compatible with adjacent uses. 305.7 Policy LU-1.2.3: Federal Sites Work closely with the federal government on re-use planning for those federal lands where a change of use may take place in the future. Even where such properties will remain in federal use, the impacts of new activities on adjacent District neighborhoods should be acknowledged and proactively addressed by federal parties. 305.8 Policy LU-1.2.4: New Methods of Land Regulation Recognize the opportunity afforded by the District’s large sites for innovative land regulation (such as form-based zoning) and the application of sustainable design principles (green building and low impact 59 development) on a large scale. 305.9 CITYWIDE ELEMENTS COMPREHENSIVE PLAN DISTRICT ELEMENTS ADOPTED 12/19/06 P. 1-48 Policy LU-1.2.5: Public Benefit Uses on Large Sites Given the significant leverage the District has in redeveloping properties which it owns, include appropriate public benefit uses on such sites if and when they are reused. Examples of such uses are affordable housing, new parks and open spaces, health care and civic facilities, public educational facilities, and other public facilities. 305.10 Policy LU-1.2.6: New Neighborhoods and the Urban Fabric On those large sites that are redeveloped as new neighborhoods (such as Reservation 13 integrate new development into the fabric of the city to the greatest extent feasible. Incorporate extensions of the city street grid, public access and circulation improvements, new public open spaces, and building intensities and massing that complement adjacent developed areas. Such sites should not be developed as selfcontained communities, isolated or gated from their surroundings. 305.11 Policy LU-1.2.7: Protecting Existing Assets on Large Sites Identify and protect existing assets such as historic buildings, historic site plan elements, important vistas, and major landscape elements as large sites are redeveloped. 305.12 Policy LU-1.2.8: Large Sites and the Waterfront Use the redevelopment of large sites to achieve related urban design, open space, environmental, and economic development objectives along the Anacostia Waterfront. Large waterfront sites should be used for water-focused recreation, housing, commercial, and cultural development, with activities that are accessible to both sides of the river. Large sites should further be used to enhance the physical and environmental quality of the river. 305.13 Action LU-1.2-A: Federal Land Transfer Continue to work with the federal government to transfer federally-owned waterfront sites and other sites as mutually agreed upon by the federal and District governments to local control to capitalize more fully on unrealized waterfront development and parkland opportunities. 305.14 Policies and specific actions for specific large sites are contained in the Comprehensive Plan Area Elements. LU-1.3 Transit-Oriented and Corridor Development 306 Over the last four decades, the District of Columbia, the federal government, and neighboring jurisdictions have invested billions of dollars in a mass transit system that effectively connects residents in many parts of the city with major employment centers and other destinations. Additional investments in rapid transit, consisting primarily of light rail, streetcars, and busways, are planned along major avenues. These improvements are essential to enhance regional mobility and accessibility, respond to future increases in demand, and provide alternatives to single passenger automobiles. The improvements also create the potential to reinforce one of the signature elements of Washington’s urban form—its boulevards. 306.1 [PULLQUOTE: Transit system improvements are essential to enhance regional mobility and accessibility, respond to future increases in demand, and provide alternatives to single passenger automobiles.] Fully capitalizing on the investment made in Metrorail requires better use of the land around transit stations and along transit corridors. While many of the District’s 40 Metrorail stations epitomize the concept of a “transit village,” with pedestrian-oriented commercial and residential development of varying scales, others do not. Some stations continue to be surrounded by large surface parking lots and CITYWIDE ELEMENTS 60 COMPREHENSIVE PLAN DISTRICT ELEMENTS ADOPTED 12/19/06 P. 1-49 auto-oriented commercial land uses. The same is true for those corridors where light rail or bus rapid transit service has been proposed. Some pass through fairly dense, walkable neighborhoods. Others consist of long, undifferentiated commercial strips with many vacant storefronts, little or no housing, and few amenities for pedestrians. 306.2 Much of the city’s planning during the last five years has focused on making better use of transit station areas. Plans have been developed for Columbia Heights, Takoma, Anacostia, Georgia Avenue/ Petworth, and Shaw/ Howard University. In each case, the objective was not to apply a “cookie-cutter” model for transit-oriented development, but rather to identify ways to better capitalize on Metrorail and more efficiently use land in the station vicinity. One objective of these initiatives has been to strengthen transit stations as neighborhood centers and attract new investment to struggling business districts. Another important objective has to been to accommodate the growth of the city in a way that minimizes the number and length of auto trips generated, and to reduce household expenses on transportation by providing options for “car-free” (or one car) living. 306.3 The District’s Metrorail stations include 15 stations within the Central Employment Area and 25 “neighborhood” stations (see Map 3.5 Looking forward, certain principles should be applied in the management of land around all of the District’s neighborhood stations. These include A preference for mixed residential and commercial uses rather than single purpose uses, particularly a preference for housing above ground floor retail uses A preference for diverse housing types, including both market-rate and affordable units and housing for seniors and others with mobility impairments A priority on attractive, pedestrian-friendly design and a de-emphasis on auto-oriented uses and surface parking Provision of well-designed, well-programmed, and well-maintained public open spaces A “stepping down” of densities with distance away from each station, protecting lower density uses in the vicinity Convenient and comfortable connections to the bus system, thereby expanding access to the stations and increasing Metro’s ability to serve all parts of the city A high level of pedestrian and bicycle connectivity between the stations and the neighborhoods around them 306.4 Beyond these core principles, station area development policies must respond to the unique needs of each community and the unique setting of each station. Some station areas wrestle with concerns over too much development, while others struggle to attract development. Moreover, the District’s role in facilitating transit-oriented development must vary from station to station. In some parts of the city, weak demand may require public investment and zoning incentives to catalyze development or achieve the desired mix of uses. In other areas, the strength of the private market provides leverage for the District to require public benefits (such as plazas, parks, and child care facilities) when approval is requested. 306.5 [PULLQUOTE: Metrorail station area development policies must respond to the unique needs of each community and the unique setting of each station. Some station areas wrestle with concerns over too much development, while others struggle to attract development.] While transit-oriented development is most commonly thought of as a strategy for Metrorail station areas, it is also applicable along premium transit corridors and the city’s “Great Streets.” Six “Great Streets” were named in 2005 as part of an integrated economic development, transportation, and urban design strategy improvement program. The location of these streets is shown in Map 3.5. While not officially CITYWIDE ELEMENTS 61 COMPREHENSIVE PLAN DISTRICT ELEMENTS ADOPTED 12/19/06 P. 1-50 designated, four other corridors—Rhode Island Avenue, North/South Capitol Streets, Lower 14th Street, and Bladensburg Road—are also shown on the map to recognize their potential for enhancement. 306.6 The “reach” of transit-oriented development around any given station or along a high volume transit corridor should vary depending on neighborhood context. While ¼ to ½ mile is generally used across the country to define the walkable radius around each station, and therefore the area in which higher densities may accommodate growth without increased traffic congestion, applying a uniform radius is not appropriate in the District. The established character and scale of the neighborhood surrounding the station should be considered, as should factors such as topography, demographics, and the station’s capacity to support new transit riders. Many stations abut historic or stable low density neighborhoods. Similarly, many of the city’s priority transit corridors transition to single family homes or row houses just one-half block or less off the street itself. 306.7 To avoid adverse effects on low and moderate density neighborhoods, most transit-oriented development should be accommodated on commercially zoned land. Possible rezoning of such land in a manner that is consistent with the Future Land Use Map and related corridor plans should be considered. Current zoning already expresses a preference for the use of such land for housing by permitting more density for mixed use projects than for projects with commercial uses alone. At the same time, some of the existing zoning categories were drafted at a time when peak hour transit volumes were lower and regional congestion was less severe. Changes to the regulations may be needed to recognize the widespread desirability of transit use by those within walking distance, taking into consideration station and systemwide capacity issues and the other factors listed above. 306.8 [Photo Caption: Eastern Market Metrorail Station] [INSERT Map 3.5 Great Streets and Transit Stations 306.9] Policy LU-1.3.1: Station Areas as Neighborhood Centers Encourage the development of Metro stations as anchors for economic and civic development in locations that currently lack adequate neighborhood shopping opportunities and employment. The establishment and growth of mixed use centers at Metrorail stations should be supported as a way to reduce automobile congestion, improve air quality, increase jobs, provide a range of retail goods and services, reduce reliance on the automobile, enhance neighborhood stability, create a stronger sense of place, provide civic gathering places, and capitalize on the development and public transportation opportunities which the stations provide. This policy should not be interpreted to outweigh other land use policies which call for neighborhood conservation. Each Metro station area is unique and must be treated as such in planning and development decisions. The Future Land Use Map expresses the desired intensity and mix of uses around each station, and the Area Elements (and in some cases Small Area Plans) provide more detailed direction for each station area. 306.10 Policy LU-1.3.2: Development Around Metrorail Stations 62 Concentrate redevelopment efforts on those Metrorail station areas which offer the greatest opportunities for infill development and growth, particularly stations in areas with weak market demand, or with large amounts of vacant or poorly utilized land in the vicinity of the station entrance. Ensure that development above and around such stations emphasizes land uses and building forms which minimize the necessity of automobile use and maximize transit ridership while reflecting the design capacity of each station and respecting the character and needs of the surrounding areas. 306.11 CITYWIDE ELEMENTS COMPREHENSIVE PLAN DISTRICT ELEMENTS ADOPTED 12/19/06 P. 1-51 Policy LU-1.3.3: Housing Around Metrorail Stations Recognize the opportunity to build senior housing and more affordable “starter” housing for first- time homebuyers adjacent to Metrorail stations, given the reduced necessity of auto ownership (and related reduction in household expenses) in such locations. 306.12 Policy LU-1.3.4: Design To Encourage Transit Use Require architectural and site planning improvements around Metrorail stations that support pedestrian and bicycle access to the stations and enhance the safety, comfort and convenience of passengers walking to the station or transferring to and from local buses. These improvements should include lighting, signage, landscaping, and security measures. Discourage the development of station areas with conventional suburban building forms, such as shopping centers surrounded by surface parking lots. 306.13 Policy LU-1.3.5: Edge Conditions Around Transit Stations Ensure that development adjacent to Metrorail stations is planned and designed to respect the character, scale, and integrity of adjacent neighborhoods. For stations that are located within or close to low density areas, building heights should “step down” as needed to avoid dramatic contrasts in height and scale between the station area and nearby residential streets and yards. 306.14 Policy LU-1.3.6: Parking Near Metro Stations Encourage the creative management of parking around transit stations, ensuring that automobile needs are balanced with transit, pedestrian, and bicycle travel needs. New parking should generally be set behind or underneath buildings and geared toward short-term users rather than all-day commuters. 306.15 Policy LU-1.3.7: TOD Boundaries Tailor the reach of transit-oriented development (TOD) policies and associated development regulations to reflect the specific conditions at each Metrorail station and along each transit corridor. The presence of historic districts and conservation areas should be a significant consideration as these policies are applied. 306.16 Policy LU-1.3.8: Public Facilities Encourage the siting (or retention and modernization) of public facilities such as schools, libraries, and government offices near transit stations and along transit corridors. Such facilities should be a focus for community activities and should enhance neighborhood identity. 306.17 Action LU-1.3-A: Station Area and Corridor Planning Conduct detailed station area and corridor plans prior to the creation of TOD overlays in an effort to avoid 63 potential conflicts between TOD and neighborhood conservation goals. These plans should be prepared collaboratively with WMATA and local communities and should include detailed surveys of parcel characteristics (including lot depths and widths existing land uses, structures, street widths, the potential for buffering, and possible development impacts on surrounding areas. Plans should also address joint public-private development opportunities, urban design improvements, traffic and parking management strategies, integrated bus service and required service facilities, capital improvements, and recommended land use and zoning changes. 306.18 Action LU-1.3-B: TOD Overlay Zone [Note: order of LU-1.3.A and LU-1.3.B have been reversed] During the forthcoming revision to the zoning regulations, create a TOD overlay district. The overlay should include provisions for mixed land uses, minimum and maximum densities (inclusive of density bonuses parking maximums, and buffering and design standards that reflect the presence of transit facilities. Work with land owners, the DC Council, local ANCs, community organizations, WMATA, and the Zoning Commission to determine the stations where such a zone should be applied. The emphasis CITYWIDE ELEMENTS COMPREHENSIVE PLAN DISTRICT ELEMENTS ADOPTED 12/19/06 P. 1-52 should be on stations that have the capacity to accommodate substantial increases in ridership and the potential to become pedestrian-oriented urban villages. Neighborhoods that meet these criteria and that would welcome a TOD overlay are the highest priority. 306.19 LU-1.4 Neighborhood Infill Development 307 There are hundreds of small vacant lots across the District of Columbia located away from transit stations and off of the major boulevards. Analysis conducted through the Comprehensive Plan revision determined that vacant, residentially-zoned lots totaled more than 400 acres in 2005. Approximately 50 percent of this acreage was zoned for single family homes, 15 percent was zoned for townhomes and rowhomes, and 35 percent was zoned for multi-family development. Most of the sites were less than one acre in size. Some of this land may not be developable to the limits allowed by zoning due to site constraints such as poor access, awkward parcel shapes, and steep topography. 307.1 Infill development on vacant lots is strongly supported in the District of Columbia, provided that such development is compatible in scale with its surroundings and consistent with environmental protection and public safety objectives. In residential areas, infill sites present some of the best opportunities in the city for “family” housing and low- to moderate-density development. In commercial areas, infill development can fill gaps in the streetwall and create more cohesive and attractive neighborhood centers. Vacant lots in such settings may also present opportunities for public uses, such as pocket parks, job training facilities, and child care centers. 307.2 [PULLQUOTE: In residential areas, infill sites present some of the best opportunities in the city for “family” housing and low- to moderate-density development. In commercial areas, infill development can fill gaps in the streetwall and create more cohesive and attractive neighborhood centers.] In both residential and commercial settings, infill development must be sensitive to neighborhood context. High quality design standards should be required, the privacy of neighboring structures should be respected, and density and scale should reflect the desired character of the surrounding area. 307.3 Infill development may also include the restoration of vacant and abandoned structures. In 2003, there 64 were an estimated 2,700 vacant and abandoned residential properties in the District. While the number has declined since then, some parts of the city continue to have relatively high concentrations of vacant buildings. As noted in the Housing Element, the city’s Home Again Initiative was launched in 2003 to restore such properties to active use. Policy LU-1.4.1: Infill Development Encourage infill development on vacant land within the city, particularly in areas where there are vacant lots that create “gaps” in the urban fabric and detract from the character of a commercial or residential street. Such development should complement the established character of the area and should not create sharp changes in the physical development pattern. 307.4 Policy LU-1.4.2: Long-Term Vacant Sites Facilitate the reuse of vacant lots that have historically been difficult to develop due to infrastructure or access problems, inadequate lot dimensions, fragmented or absentee ownership, or other constraints. Explore lot consolidation, acquisition, and other measures which would address these constraints. 307.5 Policy LU-1.4.3: Zoning of Infill Sites Ensure that the zoning of vacant infill sites is compatible with the prevailing development pattern in surrounding neighborhoods. This is particularly important in single family and row house neighborhoods that are currently zoned for multi-family development. 307.6 CITYWIDE ELEMENTS COMPREHENSIVE PLAN DISTRICT ELEMENTS ADOPTED 12/19/06 P. 1-53 See the Housing Element for policies on the development of “New Communities” on the site of aging public housing complexes and a discussion of the city’s “Home Again” program for rehabilitating vacant properties. See the Community Services and Facilities Element for policies on the “joint redevelopment” of public facilities such as libraries with modernized public facilities and additional private development. LU-2.0 Creating and Maintaining Successful Neighborhoods 308 This section of the Land Use Element focuses on land use issues within the District’s neighborhoods. It begins with a set of broad policies which state the city’s commitment to sustaining neighborhood diversity and protecting the defining characteristics of each community. This is followed by a discussion of neighborhood appearance, particularly the treatment of abandoned and blighted properties. This section then turns to a discussion of residential land use compatibility issues, followed by a discussion of neighborhood centers and commercial land use compatibility issues. 308.1 LU-2.1 A City of Neighborhoods 309 The same effort given to keep Washington’s monumental core a symbol of national pride must be given to the city’s neighborhoods. After all, the public image of the city is defined as much by its homes, businesses, streets, and neighborhood spaces as it is by its monuments and federal buildings. For Washington’s residents, the neighborhoods are the essence of the city’s social and physical environment. Land use policies must ensure that all neighborhoods have adequate access to commercial services, parks, educational and cultural facilities; and sufficient housing opportunities while protecting their rich historic and cultural legacies. 309.1 Washington has no fewer than 130 distinct and identifiable neighborhoods today. They range from 65 highdensity urban mixed use communities like the West End and Mount Vernon Square to quiet low-density neighborhoods like Crestwood and Spring Valley, providing a wide range of choices for the District’s many different types of households. Just as their physical qualities vary, the social and economic characteristics of the city’s neighborhoods also vary. In 2001, the DC Office of Planning used a range of social and economic indicators to classify neighborhoods as “stable”, “transitional”, “emerging”, or “distressed.” These indicators included income, home value and sales, school performance, crime rates, poverty rates, educational attainment, and building permit activity, among others. 309.2 Most of the District’s recent planning efforts have focused on transitional, emerging, and distressed neighborhoods. Land use strategies for these areas have emphasized the reuse of vacant sites, the refurbishment (or replacement) of abandoned or deteriorating buildings, the removal of illegal land uses, and improvements to the public realm (e.g streets and public buildings These strategies have been paired with incentives for the private sector to reinvest in each neighborhood and provide new housing choices and services. A different set of land use strategies has been applied in “stable” neighborhoods, emphasizing neighborhood conservation and appropriate infill. Land use policies in these areas have focused on retaining neighborhood character, mitigating development impacts on services and infrastructure, preventing demolition in historic districts, and improving the connection between zoning and present and desired land uses. 309.3 During the coming decades, the District will keep striving for increased stability in its transitional, emerging, and distressed neighborhoods. This does not mean that all neighborhoods should become the CITYWIDE ELEMENTS COMPREHENSIVE PLAN DISTRICT ELEMENTS ADOPTED 12/19/06 P. 1-54 same, or that a uniform “formula” for stability should be applied to each community. Rather, it means that each neighborhood should have certain basic assets and amenities (see text box below These assets and amenities should be protected and enhanced where they exist today, and created or restored where they do not. 309.4 [BEGIN TEXT BOX] What Makes a Great Neighborhood? 309.5 In 2004, “A Vision for Growing an Inclusive City” identified essential physical qualities that all neighborhoods should share. These included Transportation options for those without a car, including convenient bus service and safe access for pedestrians Easy access to shops and services meeting day-to-day needs, such as child care, groceries, and sitdown restaurants Housing choices, including homes for renters and for owners, and a range of units that meet the different needs of the community Safe, clean public gathering places, such as parks and plazas—places to meet neighbors, places for children to play, and places to exercise or connect with nature Quality public services, including police and fire protection, safe and modernized schools, and libraries and recreation centers that can be conveniently accessed (though not necessarily located within the neighborhood itself Distinctive character and a “sense of place”, defined by neighborhood architecture, visual landmarks and vistas, streets, public spaces, and historic places Evidence of visible public maintenance and investment—proof that the city “cares” about the 66 neighborhood and is responsive to its needs A healthy natural environment, with street trees and greenery, and easy access to the city’s open space system. A neighborhood’s success must be measured by more than the income of its residents or the size of its homes. A successful neighborhood should create a sense of belonging and civic pride, and a collective sense of stewardship and responsibility for the community’s future among all residents. [END TEXT BOX] Policy LU-2.1.1: Variety of Neighborhood Types Maintain a variety of residential neighborhood types in the District, ranging from low-density, single family neighborhoods to high-density, multi-family mixed use neighborhoods. The positive elements that create the identity and character of each neighborhood should be preserved and enhanced in the future. 309.6 Policy LU-2.1.2: Neighborhood Revitalization Facilitate orderly neighborhood revitalization and stabilization by focusing District grants, loans, housing rehabilitation efforts, commercial investment programs, capital improvements, and other government actions in those areas that are most in need. Use social, economic, and physical indicators such as the poverty rate, the number of abandoned or substandard buildings, the crime rate, and the unemployment rate as key indicators of need. 309.7 Policy LU-2.1.3: Conserving, Enhancing, and Revitalizing Neighborhoods Recognize the importance of balancing goals to increase the housing supply and expand neighborhood commerce with parallel goals to protect neighborhood character, preserve historic resources, and restore CITYWIDE ELEMENTS COMPREHENSIVE PLAN DISTRICT ELEMENTS ADOPTED 12/19/06 P. 1-55 the environment. The overarching goal to “create successful neighborhoods” in all parts of the city requires an emphasis on conservation in some neighborhoods and revitalization in others. 309.8 Policy LU-2.1.4: Rehabilitation Before Demolition In redeveloping areas characterized by vacant, abandoned, and underutilized older buildings, generally encourage rehabilitation and adaptive reuse of existing buildings rather than demolition. 309.9 [Photo caption: The positive elements that create the identity and character of each neighborhood should be preserved and enhanced in the future.] Policy LU-2.1.5: Conservation of Single Family Neighborhoods Protect and conserve the District’s stable, low density neighborhoods and ensure that their zoning reflects their established low density character. Carefully manage the development of vacant land and the alteration of existing structures in and adjacent to single family neighborhoods in order to protect low density character, preserve open space, and maintain neighborhood scale. 309.10 Policy LU-2.1.6: Teardowns Discourage the replacement of quality homes in good physical condition with new homes that are substantially larger, taller, and bulkier than the prevailing building stock. 309.11 Policy LU-2.1.7: Conservation of Row House Neighborhoods Protect the character of row house neighborhoods by requiring the height and scale of structures to be consistent with the existing pattern, considering additional row house neighborhoods for “historic district” designation, and regulating the subdivision of row houses into multiple dwellings. Upward and outward extension of row houses which compromise their design and scale should be discouraged. 309.11 Policy LU-2.1.8: Zoning of Low and Moderate Density Neighborhoods Discourage the zoning of areas currently developed with single family homes, duplexes, and 67 rowhouses (e.g R-1 through R-4) for multi-family apartments (e.g R-5) where such action would likely result in the demolition of housing in good condition and its replacement with structures that are potentially out of character with the existing neighborhood. 309.12 Policy LU-2.1.9: Addition of Floors and Roof Structures to Row Houses and Apartments Generally discourage increases in residential density resulting from new floors and roof structures (with additional dwelling units) being added to the tops of existing row houses and apartment buildings, particularly where such additions would be out of character with the other structures on the block. Roof structures should only be permitted if they would not harm the architectural character of the building on which they would be added or other buildings nearby. 309.13 Policy LU-2.1.10: Multi-Family Neighborhoods Maintain the multi-family residential character of the District’s Medium- and High-Density residential areas. Limit the encroachment of large scale, incompatible commercial uses into these areas, and make these areas more attractive, pedestrian-friendly, and transit accessible. 309.14 Policy LU-2.1.11: Residential Parking Requirements Ensure that parking requirements for residential buildings are responsive to the varying levels of demand associated with different unit types, unit sizes, and unit locations (including proximity to transit Parking should be accommodated in a manner that maintains an attractive environment at the street level and minimizes interference with traffic flow. Reductions in parking may be considered where transportation demand management measures are implemented and a reduction in demand can be clearly demonstrated. 309.15 CITYWIDE ELEMENTS COMPREHENSIVE PLAN DISTRICT ELEMENTS ADOPTED 12/19/06 P. 1-56 Please refer to the Transportation Element for additional policies and actions related to parking management. Policy LU-2.1.12: Reuse of Public Buildings Rehabilitate vacant or outmoded public and semi-public buildings for continued use. Reuse plans should be compatible with their surroundings, and should limit the introduction of new uses that could adversely affect neighboring communities. 309.16 Policy LU-2.1.13: Flag Lots Generally discourage the use of “flag lots” (lots with little or no street frontage, accessed by a driveway easement or narrow strip of land and typically located to the rear of another lot) when subdividing residential property. Action LU-2.1-.A: Rowhouse Zoning District Develop a new row house zoning district or divide the existing R-4 district into R-4-A and R-4-B to better recognize the unique nature of row house neighborhoods and conserve their architectural form (including height, mass, setbacks, and design 309.17 Action LU-2.1-B: Amendment of Exterior Wall Definition Amend the city’s procedures for roof structure review so that the division-on-line wall or party wall of a row house or semi-detached house is treated as an exterior wall for the purposes of applying zoning regulations and height requirements. 309.18 68 Action LU-2.1-C: Residential Rezoning Provide a better match between zoning and existing land uses in the city’s residential areas, with a particular focus on a) Blocks of well-established single family and semi-detached homes that are zoned R-3 or higher (b) Blocks that consist primarily of row houses that are zoned R-5-B or higher (c) Historic districts where the zoning does not match the predominant contributing properties on the block face In all three of these instances, pursue rezoning to appropriate densities to protect the predominant architectural character and scale of the neighborhood. 309.19 Action LU-2.1-D: Avoiding “Mansionization” Consider adjustments to the District’s zoning regulations to address the construction of excessively large homes that are out of context with the surrounding neighborhood (“mansionization” These adjustments might include the use of a sliding scale for maximum lot occupancy (based on lot size and the application of floor area ratios in single family zone districts to reduce excessive building mass. They could also include creation of a new zoning classification with a larger minimum lot size than the existing R-1-A zone, with standards that more effectively control building expansion and lot division. 309.20 LU-2.2 Maintaining Community Standards 310 “Community standards” encompasses a broad range of topics relating to the physical appearance and quality of the city’s neighborhoods. The District maintains planning, building, housing, zoning, environmental and other regulations and codes aimed at protecting public safety and keeping the city’s neighborhoods in excellent physical condition. However, instances of neglected and abandoned properties, illegal uses, unpermitted construction, and code violations are still common in many parts of the city. Despite dramatic improvements in code enforcement during recent years and a 50 percent drop CITYWIDE ELEMENTS COMPREHENSIVE PLAN DISTRICT ELEMENTS ADOPTED 12/19/06 P. 1-57 in the number of vacant properties since 2000, more effective and responsive enforcement remains one of the most frequently raised planning issues in the District today. 310.1 [PULLQUOTE: Despite dramatic improvements in code enforcement during recent years and a 50 percent drop in the number of vacant properties since 2000, more effective and responsive enforcement remains one of the most frequently raised planning issues in the District today.] Policy LU-2.2.1: Code Enforcement as a Tool for Neighborhood Conservation Recognize the importance of consistent, effective, and comprehensive code enforcement to the protection of residential neighborhoods. Housing, building, and zoning regulations must be strictly applied and enforced in all neighborhoods of the city to prevent deteriorated, unsafe, and unhealthy conditions; reduce illegal activities; maintain the general level of residential uses, densities, and height; and ensure that health and safety hazards are promptly corrected. 310.2 Policy LU-2.2.2: Appearance of Vacant Lots and Structures Maintain and enforce District programs (such as “Clean It Or Lien It”) which ensure that vacant lots and buildings are kept free of debris, litter, and graffiti. Such sites should be treated in way that eliminates neighborhood blight, improves visual quality, and enhances public safety. 310.3 Policy LU-2.2.3: Restoration or Removal of Vacant and Abandoned Buildings Reduce the number of vacant and abandoned buildings in the city through renovation, rehabilitation, and where necessary, demolition. Implement programs that encourage the owners of such buildings to sell or renovate them, and apply liens, fines, and other penalties for non-compliant properties. 310.4 Policy LU-2.2.4: Neighborhood Beautification 69 Encourage projects which improve the visual quality of the District’s neighborhoods, including landscaping and tree planting, façade improvement, anti-litter campaigns, graffiti removal, improvement or removal of abandoned buildings, street and sidewalk repair, and park improvements. 310.5 Policy LU-2.2.5: Enforcement of Approval Conditions Fully enforce conditions of approval for new development. Ensure that such projects are designed, built, and operated consistently with such conditions, and apply appropriate penalties in the event of noncompliance. 310.6 Policy LU-2.2.6: Public Stewardship Support efforts by local Advisory Neighborhood Commissions, citizen/civic associations, garden clubs, homeowner groups, and other organizations to initiate neighborhood improvement and beautification programs. Provide information, guidance, and technical assistance to these groups as appropriate and feasible. 310.7 Policy LU-2.2.7: Alley Closings Discourage the conversion of alleys to private yards or developable land when the alleys are part of the historic fabric of the neighborhood and would otherwise continue to perform their intended functions, such as access to rear garages and service areas for trash collection. 310.8 Action LU-2.2-A: Vacant Building Inventories Maintain and continuously update data on vacant and abandoned buildings in the city, and regularly assess the potential for such buildings to support new uses and activities. This should include periodic assessment of the city’s vacant building monitoring programs and exploring creative ways to deal with vacant properties and long-term vacant sites. 310.9 CITYWIDE ELEMENTS COMPREHENSIVE PLAN DISTRICT ELEMENTS ADOPTED 12/19/06 P. 1-58 Action LU-2.2-B: Education and Outreach on Public Space Maintenance Develop a public outreach campaign on the District’s public space regulations (including the use of such space for announcements, campaign signs, and advertising and resident/District responsibilities for maintenance of public space, including streets, planting strips, sidewalks, and front yards. 310.10 LU-2.3 Residential Land Use Compatibility 311 Many of Washington’s neighborhoods were developed before 1920, when the city adopted its first zoning regulations. As a result, the older neighborhoods tend to have a patchwork pattern of land uses, with business and residential activities sometimes occurring on the same block. While this pattern has created some of the city’s most desirable and interesting neighborhoods, it has also introduced the potential for conflict. Certain commercial and industrial uses may generate noise, odor, traffic, litter, and other impacts that affect the quality of life in adjacent residential neighborhoods. Similarly, introducing new residential uses to commercial or industrial areas can make it difficult for established businesses to operate effectively. 311.1 [PULLQUOTE: The older neighborhoods tend to have a patchwork pattern of land uses, with business and residential activities sometimes occurring on the same block. While this pattern has created some of the city’s most desirable and interesting neighborhoods, it has also introduced the potential for conflict.] Land use compatibility is addressed through the District’s zoning regulations. The regulations list uses that are permitted as a matter-of-right and those that are permitted with a Special Exception (and in 70 some cases, uses that are prohibited) in each zone. Over the years, a variety of “standards for external effects” have been applied to address the impacts of different activities on adjacent uses. However, the Zoning Regulations have not been comprehensively updated in almost 50 years, and do not address land use compatibility issues as effectively as they might. More effective use of performance standards, buffering and screening requirements, management of “problem” land uses, and the examination of appropriate matter of right uses should be pursued as the Zoning Regulations are redrafted. 311.2 Policy LU-2.3.1: Managing Non-Residential Uses in Residential Areas Maintain zoning regulations and development review procedures that a) prevent the encroachment of inappropriate commercial uses in residential areas; and (b) limit the scale and extent of non-residential uses that are generally compatible with residential uses, but present the potential for conflicts when they are excessively concentrated or out of scale with the neighborhood. 311.3 Policy LU-2.3.2: Mitigation of Commercial Development Impacts Manage new commercial development so that it does not result in unreasonable and unexpectedtraffic, parking, litter, shadow, view obstruction, odor, noise, and vibration impacts on surrounding residential areas. Before commercial development is approved, establish requirements for traffic and noise control, parking and loading management, building design, hours of operation, and other measures as needed to avoid such adverse effects. 311.4 Policy LU-2.3.3: Buffering Requirements Ensure that new commercial development adjacent to lower density residential areas provides effective physical buffers to avoid adverse effects. Buffers may include larger setbacks, landscaping, fencing, screening, height stepdowns, and other architectural and site planning measures that avoid potential conflicts. 311.5 CITYWIDE ELEMENTS COMPREHENSIVE PLAN DISTRICT ELEMENTS ADOPTED 12/19/06 P. 1-59 Policy LU-2.3.4: Transitional and Buffer Zone Districts Maintain mixed use zone districts which serve as transitional or buffer areas between residential and commercial districts, and which also may contain institutional, non-profit, embassy/chancery, and officetype uses. Zoning regulations for these areas (which currently include the SP-1 and SP-2 zones) should ensure that development is harmonious with its surroundings, achieves appropriate height and density transitions, and protects neighborhood character. 311.6 Policy LU-2.3.5: Institutional Uses Recognize the importance of institutional uses, such as private schools, child care facilities, and similar uses, to the economy, character, history, and future of the District of Columbia. Ensure that when such uses are permitted in residential neighborhoods, they are designed and operated in a manner that is sensitive to neighborhood issues and that maintains quality of life. Encourage institutions and neighborhoods to work proactively to address issues such as traffic and parking, hours of operation, outside use of facilities, and facility expansion. 311.7 Policy LU-2.3.6: Houses of Worship Recognize churches and other religious institutions as an important part of the fabric of the city’s neighborhoods. Work proactively with the faith-based community, residents, ANCs, and neighborhood groups to address issues associated with church transportation needs, operations, and expansion, so that churches may be sustained as neighborhood anchors and a source of spiritual guidance for District residents. 311.8 71 [Photo Caption: Churches and other religious institutions are an important part of the fabric of the city’s neighborhoods.] Policy LU-2.3.7: Non-Conforming Institutional Uses Carefully control and monitor institutional uses that do not conform to the underlying zoning to ensure their long-term compatibility. In the event such uses are sold or cease to operate as institutions, encourage conformance with existing zoning and continued compatibility with the neighborhood. 311.9 Policy LU-2.3.8: Non-Conforming Commercial and Industrial Uses Reduce the number of nonconforming uses in residential areas, particularly those uses that generate noise, truck traffic, odors, air and water pollution, and other adverse effects. Consistent with the zoning regulations, limit the expansion of such uses and fully enforce regulations regarding their operation to avoid harmful impacts on their surroundings. 311.10 Policy LU-2.3.9: Transient Accommodations in Residential Zones Continue to distinguish between transient uses—such as hotels, bed and breakfasts, and inns—and permanent residential uses such as homes and apartments in the District’s Zoning Regulations. The development of new hotels on residentially-zoned land should continue to be prohibited, incentives for hotels (such as the existing Hotel Overlay Zone) should continue to be provided on commercially zoned land, and owner-occupancy should continue to be required for transient accommodations in residential zones. 311.11 Policy LU-2.3.10: Conversion of Housing to Guest Houses and Other Transient Uses Control the conversion of residences to guest houses, bed and breakfast establishments, clinics, and other non-residential or transient uses. Zoning regulations should continue to allow larger bed and breakfasts and small inns within residential zones through the Special Exception process, with care taken to avoid the proliferation of such uses in any one neighborhood. 311.12 CITYWIDE ELEMENTS COMPREHENSIVE PLAN DISTRICT ELEMENTS ADOPTED 12/19/06 P. 1-60 Please refer to Policy 2.4.11 of this Element for additional guidance on hotel uses and the need to address their impacts. Policy LU-2.3.11: Home Occupations Maintain appropriate regulations (including licensing requirements) to address the growing trend toward home occupations, accommodating such uses but ensuring that they do not negatively impact residential neighborhoods. 311.13 Action LU-2.3-A: Zoning Changes to Reduce Land Use Conflicts in Residential Zones As part of the comprehensive rewrite of the zoning regulations, develop text amendments which a) expand buffering, screening, and landscaping requirements along the edges between residential and commercial and/or industrial zones b) more effectively manage the non-residential uses that are permitted as a matter-of-right within commercial and residential zones in order to protect neighborhoods from new uses which generate external impacts c) ensure that the height, density, and bulk requirements for commercial districts balance business needs with the need to protect the scale and character of adjacent residential neighborhoods d) provide for ground-level retail where appropriate while retaining the residential zoning along major 72 corridors; and (e) ensure that there will not be a proliferation of transient accommodations in any one neighborhood. 311.14 Action LU-2.3-B: Analysis of Non-Conforming Uses Complete an analysis of non-conforming commercial, industrial, and institutional uses in the District’s residential areas. Use the findings to identify the need for appropriate actions, such as zoning text or map amendments and relocation assistance for problem uses. 311.15 LU-2.4 Neighborhood Commercial Districts and Centers 312 Commercial uses and local public facilities are an essential part of the District’s neighborhoods. Many of these uses are clustered in well-defined centers that serve as the “heart” of the neighborhood. These areas support diverse business, civic, and social activities. Each center reflects the identity of the neighborhood around it through the shops and establishments it supports and the architecture and scale of its buildings. They are also often connecting points for public transit lines—in fact, many originated around streetcar stops and continue to be important bus transfer points today. 312.1 [PULLQUOTE: Commercial uses and local public facilities are an essential part of the District’s neighborhoods. Many of these uses are clustered in well-defined centers that serve as the “heart” of the neighborhood. These areas support diverse business, civic, and social activities.] Many District neighborhoods, particularly those on the east side of the city, lack well-defined centers or have centers that struggle with high vacancies and a limited range of neighborhood-serving businesses. Greater efforts must be made to attract new retail uses to these areas by improving business conditions, upgrading storefronts and the street environment, and improving parking and pedestrian safety and comfort. The location of new public facilities in such locations, and the development of mixed use projects that include upper story housing, can encourage their revival. 312.2 Even the most successful neighborhood centers in the District must deal with land use conflicts. Excessive concentrations of bars, liquor stores, fast-food outlets, convenience stores, and similar uses are causes of concern in almost every part of the city. Commercial parking demand affects nearby residential streets around many centers. In some locations, commercial and residential rear yards abut one another, CITYWIDE ELEMENTS COMPREHENSIVE PLAN DISTRICT ELEMENTS ADOPTED 12/19/06 P. 1-61 causing concerns over rodents, odors, noise, shadows, view obstruction, and other impacts. Effective zoning and buffering requirements are important to address such concerns and protect neighborhood character. Zoning overlays have been adopted in some commercial districts to limit the range of allowable uses and reduce the likelihood of external impacts. 312.3 Of course, not all commercial uses occur in defined centers. Many District thoroughfares are lined with “strip” commercial development, much of it auto-oriented and not particularly focused on residents of the adjacent neighborhoods. Activities such as auto dealerships and repair services, motels, and similar uses, can be important contributors to the District’s economy. Again, zoning regulations should establish where these uses are appropriate and should set buffering and screening requirements and other standards which improve the compatibility of such uses with their surroundings. 312.4 73 Policy LU-2.4.1: Promotion of Commercial Centers Promote the vitality of the District’s commercial centers and provide for the continued growth of commercial land uses to meet the needs of District residents, expand employment opportunities for District residents, and sustain the city’s role as the center of the metropolitan area. Commercial centers should be inviting and attractive places, and should support social interaction and ease of access for nearby residents. 312.5 Policy LU-2.4.2: Hierarchy of Commercial Centers Maintain and reinforce a hierarchy of neighborhood, multi-neighborhood, regional, and main street commercial centers in the District. Activities in each type of center should reflect its intended role and market area, as defined in the Framework Element. Established centers should be expanded in areas where the existing range of goods and services is insufficient to meet community needs. 312.6 Policy LU-2.4.3: Regional Centers Permit the District’s two established regional commercial centers, Georgetown and Friendship Heights, to develop and evolve in ways which are compatible with other land use policies, including those for maintaining stable neighborhoods, mitigating negative environmental impacts, managing parking, and minimizing adverse traffic impacts. Likewise, encourage the continued development of the emerging regional centers at Minnesota-Benning and Hechinger Mall in a manner that is consistent with other policies in the Comprehensive Plan. 312.7 Policy LU-2.4.4: Heights and Densities in Regional Centers Maintain heights and densities in established and proposed regional centers which are appropriate to the scale and function of development in adjoining communities and which step down to adjacent residential areas, and maintain or develop buffer areas for neighborhoods exposed to increased commercial densities. 312.8 Policy LU-2.4.5: Encouraging Nodal Development Discourage auto-oriented commercial “strip” development and instead encourage pedestrian-oriented “nodes” of commercial development at key locations along major corridors. Zoning and design standards should ensure that the height, mass, and scale of development within nodes respects the integrity and character of surrounding residential areas and does not unreasonably impact them. 312.9 Policy LU-2.4.6: Scale and Design of New Commercial Uses Ensure that new uses within commercial districts are developed at a height, mass, scale and design that is appropriate and compatible with surrounding areas. 312.10 CITYWIDE ELEMENTS COMPREHENSIVE PLAN DISTRICT ELEMENTS ADOPTED 12/19/06 P. 1-62 Policy LU-2.4.7: Location of Night Clubs and Bars Provide zoning and alcoholic beverage control laws that discourage the excessive concentration and potential negative effects of liquor licensed establishments (e.g night clubs and bars) in neighborhood commercial districts. New uses that generate late night activity and large crowds should be located away from low and moderate density residential areas and should instead be concentrated Downtown, in designated arts or entertainment districts, and in areas where there is a limited residential population nearby. 312.11 [Photo caption: 18th Street in Adams Morgan] Policy LU-2.4.8: Addressing Commercial Parking Impacts Ensure that the District’s zoning regulations consider the traffic and parking impacts of different commercial activities, and include provisions to mitigate the parking demand and congestion problems that may result as new development occurs, especially as related to loading and goods delivery. 312.12 74 [Please refer to the Transportation Element, Section 3.2 for additional policies and actions related to parking.] Policy LU-2.4.9: High-Impact Commercial Uses Ensure that the District’s zoning regulations limit the location and proliferation of fast food restaurants, sexually-oriented businesses, late night alcoholic beverage establishments, 24-hour mini-marts and convenience stores, and similar high impact commercial establishments that generate excessive late night activity, noise, or otherwise affect the quality of life in nearby residential neighborhoods. 312.13 Policy LU-2.4.10: Use of Public Space within Commercial Centers Carefully manage the use of sidewalks and other public spaces within commercial districts to avoid pedestrian obstructions and to provide an attractive and accessible environment for shoppers. Where feasible, the development of outdoor sidewalks cafes, flower stands, and similar uses which “animate” the street should be encouraged. Conversely, the enclosure of outdoor sidewalk space with permanent structures should generally be discouraged. 312.14 Policy LU-2.4.11: Hotel Impacts Manage the impacts of hotels on surrounding areas, particularly in the Near Northwest neighborhoods where large hotels adjoin residential neighborhoods. Provisions to manage truck movement and deliveries, overflow parking, tour bus parking, and other impacts associated with hotel activities should be developed and enforced. 312.15 Please refer to Policies 2.3.9 and 2.3.10 of this Element for additional guidance on hotel uses within residential neighborhoods. [Photo caption: Provisions to manage truck movement and deliveries, overflow parking, tour bus parking, and other impacts associated with hotel activities should be developed and enforced.] Policy LU-2.4.13: Monitoring of Commercial Impacts Maintain a range of monitoring, inspection, and enforcement programs for commercial areas to ensure that activities are occurring in accordance with local planning, building, zoning, transportation, health, alcoholic beverage control, and other District rules and regulations. Prompt and effective action should be taken in the event non-compliance with these rules and regulations is observed. 312.16 CITYWIDE ELEMENTS COMPREHENSIVE PLAN DISTRICT ELEMENTS ADOPTED 12/19/06 P. 1-63 Policy LU-2.4.14: Commercial Uses Outside Designated Centers Recognize that not all commercial uses can be appropriately sited within designated neighborhood, multineighborhood, and regional centers. For example, automobile sales, nurseries, building supply stores, large night clubs, hotels, and similar uses may require highway-oriented locations. The District should retain and support such uses and accommodate them on appropriately located sites. 312.17 Action LU-2.4-A: Evaluation of Commercial Zoning As part of each Small Area Plan, conduct an evaluation of commercially zoned areas to assess the appropriateness of existing zoning designations. This assessment should consider a) the heights, densities and uses that could occur under existing zoning; and (b) the suitability of existing zoning given the location and size of each area, the character of adjacent land uses, the relationship to other commercial districts in the vicinity, transportation and parking attributes, proximity to adjacent uses, and the designation on the Future Land Use Map. 312.18 Action LU-2.4-B: Zoning Changes to Reduce Land Use Conflicts in Commercial Zones As part of the comprehensive rewrite of the zoning regulations, consider text amendments that a) more effectively control the uses which are permitted as a matter-of-right in commercial zones b) avoid the excessive concentration of particular uses with the potential for adverse effects, such as convenience stores, fast food establishments, and liquor-licensed establishments; and 75 (c) consider performance standards to reduce potential conflicts between certain incompatible uses 312.19 [Photo caption: Zoning changes may reduce potential conflicts between incompatible land uses] Action LU-2.4-C: Mixed Use District with Housing Emphasis Develop a new mixed use zoning district, to be applied principally on land that is currently zoned for nonresidential uses (or that is now unzoned which limits commercial development to the ground floor of future uses and requires residential use on any upper stories. Consider the application of this designation to Metrorail stations and corridor streets that may currently have high commercial vacancies or an excess supply of commercial space, including those areas designated as “Main Street Mixed Use Corridors” and commercial centers on the Generalized Policies Map. 312.20 LU-3.0 Balancing Competing Demands For Land 313 This section of the Land Use Element addresses five specific activities that require a greater level of direction than can be covered in the “Neighborhood” policies listed described above. These activities are an essential part of the District of Columbia and are vital to the city’s future. Each of these uses presents a unique set of challenges and land use compatibility issues. They include a) Public Works and Industrial Uses, which are essential to government operations and the local economy, but also create external impacts and face displacement from higher value land uses (b) Institutional Uses, which desire land for expansion but are often hemmed in by adjacent neighborhoods (c) Foreign Missions, namely the chanceries and embassies of foreign governments, which seek to locate or expand in some of the city’s most desirable neighborhoods (d) Group Homes, Community Based Residential Facilities, and Supportive Housing, which provide for the essential housing and socialization needs of thousands of District residents but may end up concentrated in particular parts of the city CITYWIDE ELEMENTS COMPREHENSIVE PLAN DISTRICT ELEMENTS ADOPTED 12/19/06 P. 1-64 (e) Federal Facilities, which often operate in immediate proximity to residential neighborhoods, creating the need for sensitive planning as these uses expand, contract, and implement new security measures 313.1 LU-3.1 Public Works and Industrial Land Uses 314 Approximately 2,000 acres of land in the District of Columbia are zoned for industrial uses. The city’s industrial areas support a variety of uses, many of which are essential to the delivery of municipal services or which are part of the business infrastructure that underpins the local economy. In 2005, the inventory of private industrial floor space in the city was approximately 13 million square feet. 314.1 [PULLQUOTE: Approximately 2,000 acres of land in the District of Columbia are zoned for industrial uses. The city’s industrial areas support a variety of uses, many of which are essential to the delivery of municipal services or which are part of the business infrastructure that underpins the local economy.] Some of the municipal activities housed on the city’s industrial land include trash transfer and hauling, bus storage and maintenance, vehicle impoundment, police and fire training, street repair and cleaning equipment storage, and water and sewer construction services. Private activities on industrial lands include food and beverage services, laundries, printers, concrete and asphalt batching plants, distribution centers, telecommunication facilities, construction contractors and suppliers, and auto salvage yards, to name only a few. The contribution and necessity of these uses to the city’s economy is discussed in 76 the Economic Development Element of the Comprehensive Plan. 314.2 Given the lenient zoning standards within industrial areas (most of which actually favor commercial uses over industrial uses much of the city’s industrial land supply is at risk. While public works and PDR uses may no longer be logical in some areas given their proximity to Metro or residential areas, proactive measures are needed to sustain them elsewhere. 314.3 In 2005, the District of Columbia commissioned an analysis of industrial land supply and demand to provide a framework for new land use policies (see text box The recommendations of this study are incorporated in the policies and actions below. 314.4 One of the most important findings of the industrial land use analysis is that there is an immediate unmet need of approximately 70 acres for “municipal-industrial” activities. Facility needs range from an MPD Evidence Warehouse to replacement bus garages for WMATA. Several agencies, including the Architect of the Capitol, indicate that their acreage needs will increase even more in the next ten years. At the same time, there is evidence that efficiencies could be achieved through better site layouts and consolidation of some municipal functions, particularly for vehicle fleet maintenance. The findings provide compelling reasons to protect the limited supply of industrial land, and to organize municipal-industrial activities more efficiently. 314.5 [START SIDEBAR] Taking a Hard Look at DC’s Industrial Lands 314.11 The 2005-2006 Industrial Land Use Study classified DC’s industrially zoned lands into four categories Areas for Retention and Reinforcement have healthy production, distribution, and repair (PDR) uses and have good prospects for hosting such uses in the future Areas for Intensification/ Evolution will continue to be desirable for PDR activities but show patterns of underutilization and opportunities for intensified uses. Some non-PDR activities may take place in these areas in the long-term future CITYWIDE ELEMENTS COMPREHENSIVE PLAN DISTRICT ELEMENTS ADOPTED 12/19/06 P. 1-65 Areas for Strategic Public Use are needed to accommodate municipal and utility needs Areas for Land Use Change are areas where a move away from PDR uses may be appropriate due to a lack of viable PDR businesses and the desirability of these sites for other uses. In some of these areas, the District may let the market take its course. In others, pro-active measures such as rezoning may be in order. The District is currently developing criteria for evaluating rezoning requests which reflect these typologies and further consider the land use, transportation, and environmental context of each site, its unique characteristics, and its potential need for future municipal purposes. [END SIDEBAR] Policy LU-3.1.1: Conservation of Industrial Land Recognize the importance of industrial land to the economy of the District of Columbia, specifically its ability to support public works functions, and accommodate production, distribution, and repair (PDR) activities. Ensure that zoning regulations and land use decisions protect active and viable PDR land uses, while allowing compatible office and retail uses and development under standards established within CM- and M- zoning. Economic development programs should work to retain and permit such uses in the future. 314.6 77 Policy LU-3.1.2: Redevelopment of Obsolete Industrial Uses Encourage the redevelopment of outmoded and non-productive industrial sites, such as vacant warehouses and open storage yards, with higher value production, distribution, and repair uses and other activities which support the core sectors of the District economy (federal government, hospitality, higher education, etc 314.7 Policy LU-3.1.3: Location of PDR Areas Accommodate Production, Distribution, and Repair (PDR) uses—including municipal public works facilities—in areas that are well buffered from residential uses (and other sensitive uses such as schools easily accessed from major roads and railroads, and characterized by existing concentrations of PDR and industrial uses. Such areas are generally designated as “PDR” on the Comprehensive Plan’s Future Land Use Map. 314.8 Policy LU-3.1.4: Rezoning of Industrial Areas Allow the rezoning of industrial land for non-industrial purposes only when the land can no longer viably support industrial or PDR activities or is located such that industry cannot co-exist adequately with adjacent existing uses. Examples include land in the immediate vicinity of Metrorail stations, sites within historic districts, and small sites in the midst of stable residential neighborhoods. In the event such rezoning results in the displacement of active uses, assist these uses in relocating to designated PDR areas. 314.9 Policy LU-3.1.5: Mitigating Industrial Land Use Impacts Mitigate the adverse impacts created by industrial uses through a variety of measures, including buffering, site planning and design, strict environmental controls, performance standards, and the use of a range of industrial zones that reflect the varying impacts of different kinds of industrial uses. 314.10 Policy LU-3.1.6: Siting Of Industrial-Type Public Works Facilities Use performance standards (such as noise, odor, and other environmental controls minimum distance requirements, and other regulatory and design measures to ensure the compatibility of industrial-type public works facilities such as trash transfer stations with surrounding land uses.

Maintain zoning regulations that strictly regulate such uses in residential areas, in order to avoid land use conflicts and business-related impacts. 314.13 Policy LU-3.1.8: Co-Location of Municipal Public Works Functions Improve the performance of existing industrial areas through zoning regulations and city policies which encourage the more efficient use of land, including the co-location of municipal functions (such as fleet maintenance, record storage, and warehousing) on consolidated sites rather than independently managed scattered sites. 314.14 Policy LU-3.1.9: Central Management of Public Works Promote the central management of municipal public works activities to avoid the displacement of essential government activities and the inefficiencies and increased costs resulting from more distant 78 locations and future land acquisition needs. Consider “land banking” appropriately located Districtowned properties and vacant sites to accommodate future municipal space needs. 314.15 Policy LU-3.1.10: Land Use Efficiency Through Technology Encourage the more efficient use of PDR land through the application of technologies which reduce acreage requirements for public works. Examples of such applications include the use of diesel- electric hybrid buses (which can be accommodated in multi-level garages using distributed power generation rather than large centralized facilities, and emphasizing green building technologies to reduce infrastructure needs. 314.16 Action LU-3.1-A: Industrial Zoning Use Changes Provide a new zoning framework for industrial land, including Prohibiting high impact “heavy” industries in the C-M zones to reduce the possibility of land use conflicts Prohibiting certain civic uses that detract from the industrial character of C-M areas and that could ultimately interfere with business operations Requiring special exceptions for potentially incompatible large retail uses in the C-M zone to provide more control over such uses without reducing height and bulk standards Limiting non-industrial uses in the M zone to avoid encroachment by uses which could impair existing industrial and public works activities (such as trash transfer Creating an IP (industrial park) district with use and bulk regulations that reflect prevailing activities Creating a Mixed Use district where residential, commercial, and lesser-impact PDR uses are permitted, thereby accommodating live-work space, artisans and studios, and more intensive commercial uses. Once these changes have been made, pursue the rezoning of selected sites in a manner consistent with the policies of the Comprehensive Plan. The zoning changes should continue to provide the flexibility to shift the mix of uses within historically industrial areas and should not diminish the economic viability of existing industrial activities or the other compatible activities that now occur in PDR areas. 314.17 Action LU-3.1-B: Industrial Land Use Compatibility During the revision of the Zoning Regulations, develop performance standards and buffering guidelines to improve edge conditions where industrial uses abut residential uses, and to address areas where residential uses currently exist within industrially zoned areas. 314.18 CITYWIDE ELEMENTS COMPREHENSIVE PLAN DISTRICT ELEMENTS ADOPTED 12/19/06 P. 1-67 Action LU-3.1-C: Joint Facility Development Actively pursue intergovernmental agreements to develop joint facilities for District and federal agencies (such as DPR and NPS District and transit agencies (DPW and WMATA and multiple public utilities (Pepco and WASA 314.19 Action LU-3.1-D: Inventory of Housing In Industrial Areas Compile an inventory of existing housing units within industrially zoned areas to identify pockets of residential development that should be rezoned (to mixed use or residential) in order to protect the housing stock. 314.20 LU-3.2 Institutional Uses 315 Institutional uses occupy almost 2,300 acres—an area larger than all of the city’s retail, office, and hotel uses combined. These uses include colleges and universities, private schools, child care facilities, houses of worship and religious institutions, hospitals, private and non-profit organizations, and similar activities. 79 315.1 The District is home to about a dozen colleges and universities, enrolling more than 75,000 students. There are also nearly 70 non-local college and university programs that occupy space in the city. The District contains more than a dozen hospitals, some located on the campuses of its universities and others occupying their own campuses or federal enclaves. Hundreds of non-profit and private institutions also operate within the city, ranging from private schools and seminaries to historic home museums and the headquarters of leading international organizations. Major institutional uses are shown on Map 3.6. 315.2 The city’s institutions make an important contribution to the District economy and are an integral part of Washington’s landscape and history. The colleges and universities alone spend over $1.5 billion dollars annually and employ 21,000 workers. Through partnerships with government and private industry, the city’s museums, higher education, and health care institutions provide services and resources to the community that could not possibly be provided by government alone. 315.3 PULLQUOTE: The city’s institutions make an important contribution to the District economy and are an integral part of Washington’s landscape and history. The colleges and universities alone spend over $1.5 billion dollars annually and employ 21,000 workers. The growth of private institutions has generated significant concern in many of the city’s neighborhoods. These concerns relate both to external impacts such as traffic and parking, and to broader concerns about the character of communities where institutions are concentrated or expanding. 315.4 Please see the Educational Facilities Element for additional policies and actions related to colleges and universities. [INSERT Map 3.6 Colleges, Universities, and Hospitals 315.5] Policy LU-3.2.1: Transportation Impacts of Institutional Uses Support ongoing efforts by District institutions to mitigate their traffic and parking impacts by promoting ridesharing, carpooling, public transportation, shuttle service and bicycling; providing on-site parking; and undertaking other transportation demand management measures. 315.6 Policy LU-3.2.2: Corporate Citizenship Support continued “corporate citizenship” among the city’s large institutions, including its colleges, universities, hospitals, private schools, and non-profits. Given the large land area occupied by these uses CITYWIDE ELEMENTS COMPREHENSIVE PLAN DISTRICT ELEMENTS ADOPTED 12/19/06 P. 1-68 and their prominence in the community, the city’s institutions (along with the District itself) should be encouraged to be role models for smaller employers in efforts to improve the city’s physical environment. This should include a continued commitment to high quality architecture and design on local campuses, expanded use of “green building” methods and low impact development, and the adaptive reuse and preservation of historic buildings. 315.7 Policy LU-3.2.3: Non-Profits, Private Schools, and Service Organizations Ensure that large non-profits, service organizations, private schools, seminaries, colleges and universities, and other institutional uses that occupy large sites within residential areas are planned, designed, and managed in a way that minimizes objectionable impacts on adjacent communities. The zoning 80 regulations should ensure that the expansion of these uses is not permitted if the quality of life in adjacent residential areas is significantly adversely affected. 315.8 Action LU-3.2-A: Zoning Actions for Institutional Uses Complete a study of residential zoning requirements for institutional uses other than colleges and universities. Determine if additional review by the Board of Zoning Adjustment or Zoning Commission should be required in the event of a change in use. Also determine if the use should be removed as an allowable or special exception use, or made subject to additional requirements. 315.9 Action LU-3.2-B: Special Exception Requirements for Institutional Housing Amend the zoning regulations to require a special exception for dormitories, rooming houses, boarding houses, fraternities, sororities, and similar uses in the R-4 zoning district. LU-3.3 Foreign Missions 316 There are 169 countries across the globe with foreign missions in the District of Columbia. These missions assist the US government in maintaining positive diplomatic relations with the international community. By international treaty, the US government is obligated to help foreign governments in obtaining suitable facilities for their diplomatic missions. This obligation was reinforced through the Foreign Missions Act of 1982, which established an Office of Foreign Missions within the Department of State and empowered the Secretary of State to set criteria relating to the location of foreign missions in the District. As noted in the text box below, foreign missions are housed in many different types of buildings, ranging from row houses and mansions to custom-designed office buildings. 316.1 [PULLQUOTE: There are 169 countries across the globe with foreign missions in the District of Columbia. These missions assist the US government in maintaining positive diplomatic relations with the international community.] The number of Foreign Missions in the city increased 27 percent between 1983 and 2003, in part fueled by the breakup of the Soviet Union. While an increase of this scale is not expected in the near future, some growth is likely. In addition, some of the existing missions are likely to relocate as they outgrow their facilities, respond to increased security requirements, and move beyond their traditional diplomatic functions. The Federal Elements of the Comprehensive Plan indicate that sites for as many as 100 new and relocated chanceries may be needed during the next 25 years. The availability of sites that meet the needs of foreign missions within traditional diplomatic areas is limited and the International Chancery Center on Van Ness Avenue has no available sites remaining. Additional areas may be needed for chancery use and it may be necessary for foreign missions to look beyond traditional diplomatic enclaves.316.2 The Foreign Missions Act of 1982 established procedures and criteria governing the location, replacement, or expansion of chanceries in the District of Columbia. The Act identifies areas where CITYWIDE ELEMENTS COMPREHENSIVE PLAN DISTRICT ELEMENTS ADOPTED 12/19/06 P. 1-69 foreign missions may locate without regulatory review (“matter of right” areas including all areas zoned commercial, industrial, waterfront, or mixed use. These areas are located in all quadrants of the city, and include large areas south of the National Mall and east of the Anacostia River. The 1982 Act also identifies areas where foreign missions may locate subject to disapproval by the District of Columbia Foreign Missions Board of Zoning Adjustment (FMBZA These include areas zoned medium-high and high-density residential, special purpose, and areas within a Diplomatic overlay zone. 316.3 As a result of the analysis accomplished in support of the Foreign Missions Act, a methodology was 81 developed in 1983 to determine the most appropriate areas for foreign missions to locate, subject to FMBZA review. The 1983 methodology allows foreign missions to locate in low and moderate density city blocks (“squares”) in which one-third or more of the area is used for office, commercial, or other non-residential uses. In some cases, a consequence of the square-by-square determination has been an unanticipated increase in chanceries. 316.4 In 2003, the National Capital Planning Commission completed a further analysis of chancery siting standards, concluding that zoning regulations and maps could be revised to more compatibly accommodate foreign missions in the future. The Federal Elements of the Comprehensive Plan suggest that new chanceries be encouraged along South Capitol Street, Massachusetts Avenue (within Reservation 13 and the 16th Street corridor, and that a new foreign mission center be developed on the Armed Forces Retirement Home or along South Capitol Street. Since the time the Federal Elements were adopted, Walter Reed Hospital also has been discussed as a possible site. 316.5 [BEGIN SIDEBAR] Washington’s Foreign Missions 316.7 The facilities that house diplomatic functions in Washington are commonly referred to as embassies. To differentiate the functions that occur in buildings occupied by foreign missions, a variety of designations are used Chanceries are the principal offices used by a foreign mission Chancery annexes are used for diplomatic purposes in support of the mission, such as cultural attaches or consular operations Ambassador’s residences are the official homes of ambassadors or chiefs of missions Many foreign governments occupy chanceries, chancery annexes, and ambassador’s residences in more than one location. In 2004, the federal government indicated there were 483 separate facilities in the city serving these functions. Since 1982, chanceries have been allowed to locate in most of Washington’s non-residential zone districts as a matter of right. They are also permitted in the city’s higher-density residential and special purpose (SP) zones, and in less dense residential areas covered by a diplomatic overlay district. Historically, the city’s chanceries have concentrated in Northwest Washington, particularly along Massachusetts Avenue (“Embassy Row” and in the adjacent Sheridan-Kalorama and Dupont Circle neighborhoods. There are also 16 chanceries on a large federal site adjacent to the Van Ness/UDC Metro station, specifically created to meet the demand for foreign missions. [END SIDEBAR] CITYWIDE ELEMENTS COMPREHENSIVE PLAN DISTRICT ELEMENTS ADOPTED 12/19/06 P. 1-70 Policy LU-3.3.1: Chancery Encroachment in Low Density Areas Encourage foreign missions to locate their chancery facilities in areas where adjacent existing and proposed land uses are compatible (e.g office, commercial, and mixed use taking special care to protecting the integrity of residential areas. Discourage the conversion of existing single family residences into foreign missions, except for use as ambassadors’ residences. 316.6 Policy LU-3.3.2: Target Areas for New Chanceries Encourage the development of new chancery facilities in locations where they would support the District’s neighborhood revitalization and economic development goals, particularly on federal enclaves and in the portion of the city east of 16th Street NW. Work with the Department of State, the National Capital Planning Commission and other organizations to provide incentives for foreign missions to 82 locate in these areas. 316.8 Policy LU-3.3.3: Compatibility of New Chanceries Promote the design of chanceries in a manner that protects the city’s open space and historic resources, mitigates impacts on nearby properties, is compatible with the scale and character of its surroundings, and enhances Washington’s international image as a city of great architecture and urban design. 316.9 Action LU-3.3-A: Modifications to the Diplomatic Overlay Zone Work with the National Capital Planning Commission and Department of State to develop a new methodology to determine appropriate additional chancery development areas; and revise the mapped diplomatic areas, reflecting additional areas where foreign missions may relocate. Recognizing the overconcentration of chanceries in Sheridan-Kalorama, every effort should be made to limit any additional chanceries in that neighborhood. 316.10 Action LU-3.3-B: Foreign Mission Mapping Improvements Improve the mapping of foreign mission locations in the city, ensuring that they are accurately inventoried and that chanceries, ambassador’s residences, and institutional land uses are appropriately distinguished. 316.11 Action LU-3.3-C: New Foreign Missions Center Support the development of a new foreign missions center on federal land in the District of Columbia. 316.12 LU-3.4 Group Housing 317 Group housing accommodates District residents with a wide variety of special needs, including persons with physical and mental disabilities, terminal illnesses, foster children, parolees, recovering substance abusers, victims of domestic violence, the elderly, and others. Such homes have become increasingly common due to the closure of large institutions and greater recognition of the social benefits of group living arrangements. Group housing can provide a family-like environment, aid in the development of life skills, and foster the integration of persons with special needs into society. Yet such housing is often the most difficult uses in the city to site due to public concerns about neighborhood impacts. 317.1 [PULLQUOTE: Group homes have become increasingly common due to the closure of large institutions and greater recognition of the social benefits of group living arrangements. They can provide a familylike environment, aid in the development of life skills, and foster the integration of persons with special needs into society.] The District’s zoning regulations recognize many types of group housing, including adult rehabilitation homes, community residence facilities, emergency shelters, health care facilities, substance abuser homes, CITYWIDE ELEMENTS COMPREHENSIVE PLAN DISTRICT ELEMENTS ADOPTED 12/19/06 P. 1-71 youth rehabilitation homes, and youth and youth residential care homes. Other types of group housing also exist. Their impacts are substantially different depending on their size, location, and the population they serve. 317.2 Recognizing the distinction between the different types of group housing is important because different licensing procedures and zoning requirements apply based on the number and characteristics of residents served. These requirements are guided by the federal Fair Housing Act, particularly 1988 Amendments limiting the degree to which zoning may restrict group home location, placement, and operation. 83 Under federal law, all state and local governments are required to make “reasonable accommodation” to house persons with disabilities. Interpretation of this standard has been the subject of litigation in cities across the country for almost two decades. 317.3 The District’s geographic information system (GIS) includes a partial inventory of group housing in the District; this is shown in Map 3.7. While this is not a complete inventory, it clearly illustrates that such housing is more heavily concentrated in some parts of the city than others. This is the result of a number of factors, including land costs, proximity to supportive services, and the density and character of housing in the city. The District’s Zoning Regulations permit most categories of group homes with six residents or less as matter-of-right uses in all residential zones. However, some categories of small group homes— including those for recovering substance abusers and adjudicated felons—are subject to Special Exception requirements from the Board of Zoning Adjustment, as well as distance separation standards. Minimum distance standards also apply to youth residential care and community residence facilities with nine to 15 residents. These standards limit the siting of new group homes within 1,000 feet of existing group homes in single-family zones and within 500 feet in moderate and higher density zones. 317.4 The licensing, monitoring, and management of group homes also have been raised as community concerns. Similarly, the need to more effectively involve the community in siting decisions, and to provide better notification of siting requests has been raised. Despite zoning standards, there are still concerns about neighborhoods becoming more institutional in character as group homes are established. There are also concerns about fairness and equity, given the fact that some neighborhoods have many group homes while others have none. Resolving this particular dilemma is complicated by the soaring cost of real estate, which tends to shift demand to the most affordable parts of the city. 317.5 [INSERT Map LU-7 Locations of Group Homes 317.6] In the coming years, the District will strive to locate group homes in a manner that balances neighborhood concerns while meeting the housing needs of all residents. Additional examination of the District’s zoning regulations, improvement of zoning definitions, and clearer siting standards for the different categories of group homes are recommended. Increased coordination between the agencies responsible for licensing and monitoring all community housing facilities should be achieved. Greater community involvement, including advisory committees, good neighbor agreements, and more rigorous monitoring procedures, should be used to improve operations and address land use conflicts. 317.7 [PULLQUOTE: Greater community involvement, including advisory committees, good neighbor agreements, and more rigorous monitoring procedures, should be used to improve group home operations and address land use conflicts.] Policy LU-3.4.1: Reasonable Accommodation of Group Homes Recognize the importance of group homes to providing a positive, healthy environment for many residents of the District of Columbia. Ensure that the District’s planning, zoning, and housing codes make reasonable accommodation for group homes without diminishing the character or fundamental qualities of its residential neighborhoods. 317.8 CITYWIDE ELEMENTS COMPREHENSIVE PLAN DISTRICT ELEMENTS ADOPTED 12/19/06 P. 1-72 Policy LU-3.4.2: Promoting More Equitable Distribution 84 Encourage a more balanced distribution of group housing in the District of Columbia. The concentration of group homes or creation of excessively large group homes in a manner that would threaten the residential character of any one neighborhood should be strictly avoided. Such concentrations are inconsistent with the objective of integrating special needs populations into the larger community. Care should be taken to locate particular special needs populations where they can best receive services and support. 317.9 Policy LU-3.4.3: Small Group Housing for the Disabled As required by the federal Fair Housing Act, allow group homes with six or fewer residents (excluding staff or caregivers) serving persons with disabilities in all residential zone districts. Zoning requirements for such homes that are more restrictive than those applying to other residential uses are unlawful and shall not be permitted. 317.10 Policy LU-3.4.4: Larger Group Housing and Group Housing Serving Non-Disabled Populations Permit larger group housing (with seven or more residents) and group homes serving non-disabled persons with special needs (including youth and adult rehabilitation homes) in all residential districts, subject to Board of Zoning Adjustment approval and siting standards that discourage excessive concentration and that comply with federal housing laws. The Special Exception process should be used to ensure public notification and involvement and to establish conditions that improve the compatibility of group homes with surrounding uses. Siting standards for such housing shall be contained in the Zoning Regulations. 317.11 Policy LU-3.4.5: Design Compatibility of Group Homes Encourage the design and appearance of group homes to be consistent with the character of the surrounding neighborhood and to blend with adjacent residences to the maximum extent possible. 317.12 Policy LU-3.4.6: Communication on Group Home Operations Increase coordination and communication between the District, group home operators, and area residents in order to improve operations, address community concerns such as parking and public safety, and more fully integrate group home residents into the community. Consider the use of community advisory boards and task forces to mediate operational and siting issues, including the size of the facility. 317.13 Policy LU-3.4.7: Licensing and Group Home Code Compliance Ensure that the permitting, licensing, monitoring, and operation of group homes meets all applicable codes and standards. Improve enforcement programs to ensure compliance and take prompt, effective action in the event of violations. 317.14 Policy LU-3.4.8: Public Information On Group Housing Needs Improve public education and information on the need for group housing in the District, and on issues related to their operation and resident needs. 317.15 Action LU-3.4-A: Clarification of Community Housing Definitions Clarify the definitions of the various types of community housing in the District, and ensure the consistent use of these definitions in all planning, building, and zoning codes and licensing regulations. 317.16 Action LU-3.4-B: Information on Group Home Location Provide easily accessible information on location and occupancy for all licensed group home facilities in the District. Such information should be accessible via the Internet and also should be available in mapped format, with appropriate protections for the privacy rights of the disabled. 317.17 CITYWIDE ELEMENTS COMPREHENSIVE PLAN DISTRICT ELEMENTS ADOPTED 12/19/06 P. 1-73 Action LU-3.4-C: Analysis of Group Home Siting Standards 85 Conduct an analysis of the spatial standards currently used to regulate group homes and homeless shelters in the District, and determine if adjustments to these standards are needed to create additional siting opportunities. In addition, consider allowing group homes and homeless shelter in Zone Districts CM-1 and CM-2. 317.18 Action LU-3.4-D: Community Housing Ombudsman Establish an ombudsman position within the District of Columbia to serve as a resource for residents, neighborhood organizations and other stakeholders, government, and group home operators. The ombudsman would encourage educational efforts, enforcement of Fair Housing Act policy, and dispute resolution related to the siting and operations of group homes within the District. 317.19 LU-3.5 Federal Facilities 318 When streets and highways are subtracted out, about one-third of the land area of the District of Columbia is owned by the federal government. Most of this land is managed by the National Park Service, but a significant amount—more than 2,700 acres—is comprised of federal installations, offices, military bases, and similar uses. This acreage includes nearly 2,000 buildings, with over 95 million square feet of floor space. Federal uses occupy a range of physical settings, from self-contained enclaves like Bolling Air Force Base to grand office buildings in the heart of Downtown Washington. Federal uses operate in all quadrants of the city, often amidst residential neighborhoods. Since they are largely exempt from zoning, coordination and communication are particularly important to ensure land use compatibility. 318.1 [Photo Caption: Federal uses occupy a range of physical settings, from self-contained enclaves like Bolling Air Force Base to grand office buildings in the heart of Downtown Washington] Many of the District’s federal uses have unique security requirements and operational needs. This became particularly apparent after 9/11, as streets around the US Capitol were permanently closed and major federal offices and monuments were retrofitted to improve security. Security needs are likely to create further changes to the District’s landscape in the future; the recent proposal to relocate thousands of Homeland Security workers to the west campus of St. Elizabeths Hospital is just one example. 318.2 The size of the federal workforce in the District is projected to increase during the next decade, following more than two decades of downsizing. The District supports this increase, as well as continued adherence to a 1968 federal policy to maintain 60 percent of the region’s federal employees within the District of Columbia. At the same time, the federal government is in the process of transferring several tracts of land to the District, potentially reducing the land area for their expansion. This suggests the need for even greater coordination on the planning and development front in the future. Several successful joint planning efforts have recently been completed, including plans for the South Capitol Street Corridor, the Southeast Federal Center, and the Anacostia Waterfront. Efforts like these must continue as the future of Walter Reed Army Medical Center, the Armed Forces Retirement Home, RFK Stadium, and other large federal sites is resolved. 318.3 [PULLQUOTE: The size of the federal workforce in the District is projected to increase during the next decade, following more than two decades of downsizing.

The “Federal Workplace” Element of that Plan includes policies to reinforce the preeminence of the monumental core through future siting CITYWIDE ELEMENTS COMPREHENSIVE PLAN DISTRICT ELEMENTS ADOPTED 12/19/06 P. 1-74 decisions, give preference to urban and transit-served sites when siting new workplaces, and emphasize the modernization of existing structures before building new structures. The Federal Elements include guidelines on detail the types of federal functions that are appropriate within the Capitol Complex, the Central Employment Area, federal installations, and other areas within the District of Columbia, as well as elsewhere in the region. 318.4 [INSERT Map 3.8: Federal Lands, 2005 318.5] Policy LU-3.5.1: District/ Federal Joint Planning Coordinate with the National Capital Planning Commission, the National Park Service, the General Services Administration, the Architect of the Capitol, and other federal agencies to address planning issues involving federal lands, including the monumental core, the waterfront, and the park and open space network. Encourage the use of master plans, created through participatory planning processes, to guide the use of large federal sites. 318.6 Policy LU-3.5.2: Federal Sites and Adjacent Neighborhoods Support expansion of the federal workforce and redevelopment of federal sites in a manner that is consistent with neighborhood revitalization, urban design, economic development, and environmental quality goals. Federal land uses should strive to maintain land use compatibility with adjacent neighborhoods. 318.7 Policy LU-3.5.3: Recognition of Local Planning and Zoning Regulations Encourage the federal government to abide by local planning and zoning regulations to the maximum extent feasible. 318.8 Policy LU-3.5.4: Federal Workplaces and District Goals Strongly support the implementation of Federal Element policies for federal workplaces calling for transportation demand management, sustainable design, energy conservation, additional workforce housing, and the creation of job opportunities in economically distressed communities within the District of Columbia. 318.9 Policy LU-3.5.5: Neighborhood Impact of Federal Security Measures Consistent with the Federal Elements, ensure that federal security measures do not impede the District’s commerce and vitality, excessively restrict or impede the use of public space or streets, or impact the health of the existing landscape. Additional street closures are to be avoided to the maximum extent possible. 318.10 Policy LU-3.5.6: Reducing Exposure to Hazardous Materials Avoid locating and operating federal facilities that produce hazardous waste or that increase the threat of accidental or terrorist-related release of hazardous materials in heavily populated or environmentally sensitive areas. 318.11 Actions relating to federal facility sites may be found in the Comprehensive Plan Area Elements CITYWIDE ELEMENTS COMPREHENSIVE PLAN DISTRICT ELEMENTS ADOPTED 12/19/06 P. 1-75 CHAPTER 4 TRANSPORTATION Overview 400 The Transportation Element provides policies and actions to maintain and improve the District’s 87 transportation system and enhance the travel choices of current and future residents, visitors and workers. These policies are complemented by policies in the Land Use, Urban Design, and Environmental Protection elements on related topics such as air quality and the management of public space. Recognizing the interplay between transportation and these related topics is critical to improving mobility and accessibility in the city. 400.1 The critical transportation issues facing the District of Columbia are addressed in this element. These include: Expanding the city’s transit system to provide alternatives to the use of single-occupant autos Enhancing the city’s corridors for all modes of transportation Increasing bicycle and pedestrian connections, routes and facilities Improving the efficiency of the existing transportation system Investing in bridge and roadway maintenance and repair Promoting transportation demand management A well-balanced and multi-modal transportation system is integral to the city’s efforts to sustain and enhance the quality of life and key to its future economic growth and its role as the nation’s capital. Achieving such a system requires integrating land use and transportation, and implementing a range of improvements that enhance connectivity, livability, and vitality. 400.2 As the nation’s capital and the center of one of the country’s fastest growing metropolitan areas, the District faces increasingly complex mobility challenges as it plans for its future. While the city still retains a large share of the region’s jobs, the region itself continues to decentralize, creating longer commutes, increased peak period congestion, and poor air quality. Within the District, the major surface transportation arteries are highly congested during morning and evening commuting periods and the Metrorail system in Central Washington is expected to reach capacity in the near future. Funding to maintain the existing transportation system, let alone expand the system to meet increased demand, is severely constrained. 400.3 However, these challenges also present opportunities. The District has one of the most extensive mass transit systems in the country, densities that support and promote transit use, a growing network of bicycle and pedestrian trails, and a unique system of radial boulevards that distinguish it from all other American cities. Washington’s gracious avenues, bridges, and parkways are part of its history and a defining element of its urban form and character. With appropriate strategies in place, these transportation assets can enhance the quality of life in the city and increase the District’s attractiveness while still performing their essential function to move people and goods in and around the city. 400.4 The city is also taking steps to augment and sustain its existing transportation network. It is expanding transit via bus rapid transit and light rail to areas not served by Metrorail. It is replacing the Anacostia River bridges, including the South Capitol and 11th Street bridges, to improve mobility and roadway operations and to support economic development and urban beautification goals. It is improving sidewalks and bicycle routes across the District.

The District’s Department of Transportation (DDOT) manages and maintains the city’s transportation infrastructure. In 2006, DDOT will complete its federally mandated state transportation plan, known as the 2030 Transportation Vision Plan. The Plan directs transportation policies and investments for the District and will serve as a guiding document for DDOT in the coming years. This Element incorporates planning and policy guidance from the Transportation Vision Plan. 400.7 The 2030 Transportation Vision Plan includes an Action Plan, which identifies a number of transportation investments across the District. Many of the action items described in the plan are already in the project development process and many have been studied at least through the preliminary feasibility study stage. Table 4.2 summarizes some of the major transportation investments envisioned in the Transportation Vision Plan. These and other ongoing and planned transportation investments are discussed in more detail later in this Element. 400.8 Transportation Goal 401 The overarching goal for transportation in the District is as follows: Create a safe, sustainable, efficient multi-modal transportation system that meets the access and mobility needs of District residents, the regional workforce, and visitors; supports local and regional economic prosperity; and enhances the quality of life for District residents. 401.1 [PULLQUOTE: The overarching goal for transportation in the District is as follows: Create a safe, sustainable, efficient, multi-modal transportation system that meets the access and mobility needs of District residents, the regional workforce, and visitors; supports local and regional economic prosperity; and enhances the quality of life for District residents.] CITYWIDE ELEMENTS COMPREHENSIVE PLAN DISTRICT ELEMENTS ADOPTED 12/19/06 P. 1-77 Table 4.2: Summary of Major Action Projects in the 2030 Transportation Vision Plan 400.9 Action Description Transit Investments The District is currently working to expand transit alternatives by enhancing local bus service and introducing premium services such as bus rapid transit and streetcar.

Multimodal Centers The District is currently looking at three potential intermodal centers located at Union Station, Kennedy Center, and Banneker Overlook. These centers would provide a “park-once” service where travelers can park their vehicles and then travel efficiently and safely around the District by other modes. DC Circulator Phase II Phase II will continue to link major points of interest in Central Washington and will be designed to provide fast, efficient service for people visiting, working, and living in the D istrict. Pedestrian Node Improvements Pedestrian node improvements include improvements at high-volume nodes such as Metrorail stations. The improvements could include better crosswalks and pedestrian signal treatments, curb extensions that shorten crossing distances, and upgraded waiting areas, including bus shelters. Bicycle Network Expansion The District is working to develop a comprehensive network of bicycle facilities for recreational and non-recreational users. The recently completed Bicycle Master Plan calls for 150 signed miles of bicycle routes, 60 miles of bicycle lanes, and building or improving 90 miles of off-road trails. Tiered Truck Route System The District is planning a series of preferred truck routes; a zone in the heavily congested and security-sensitive downtown area, from which large trucks would be prohibited during the business day; and truck prohibitions on all other roads unless travel on the street is necessary for the truck to reach its destination. The truck system will be planned in consultation with federal agencies. Water Taxi A waterway transportation system is proposed to extend from Rock Creek, on the Potomac River, and from Children’s Island, on the Anacostia River, to the Ronald Reagan W ashington National Airport and Old Town Alexandria, Virginia. CITYWIDE ELEMENTS COMPREHENSIVE PLAN DISTRICT ELEMENTS ADOPTED 12/19/06 P. 1-78 Policies and Actions T-1.0 Linking Land Use and Transportation 402 Transportation and land use are the fundamental components of development, and are inextricably linked to each other and to the form of our cities. The construction of a new transportation facility, such as a Metrorail station or a light rail or streetcar line, influences the nature and location of new development in that area. The nature and location of development in turn, influences patterns of travel for residents. Transportation facilities themselves are a significant element of the built environment, creating connections but at times also creating barriers. They can spur economic development and help attract private investment, but they can also create land use conflicts and environmental problems. 402.1 [PULLQUOTE: The transportation system as a whole benefits when more compact residential and employment areas are situated along major transit routes. Travel times are reduced and there is better use of public transportation investments.] T-1.1 Land Use – Transportation Coordination 403 As laid out in the Framework Element of this Plan, the city and region are expected to gain jobs and households over the next 20 years. Coordinating transportation and land use decisions is critical to making the best use of infrastructure and finite land resources as these gains occur. The balance between housing and jobs plays a clear role in travel patterns. In general, the demands on our transportation system are reduced when homes are located close to places of employment and shopping. People spend less time traveling and overall quality of life may be improved. The transportation system as a whole benefits when more compact residential and employment areas are situated along major transit routes. Travel times are reduced and there is better use of public transportation investments. 403.1 90 Although the District has already developed walkable, transit-oriented neighborhoods, future opportunities will arise to strengthen the linkage between land use and transportation as new development takes place. Design features play an important role in this equation. Residential communities should be developed so that services such as shopping are accessible on foot, transit, or bicycle and not just by car. The design of transportation infrastructure can also have a major impact on travel behavior and system performance. For example, the re-design of the Anacostia River crossings to be implemented in the coming years will provide for pedestrian and bicycle access across the river, while the current bridge crossings discourage or prohibit it. 403.2 The space needs of transportation support facilities—including bus garages, service yards, and motor vehicle inspection facilities—also call for stronger coordination between land use and transportation planning. The Washington Metropolitan Area Transit Authority already reports a need for additional bus storage and service yards. As new transit lines are developed, additional land will be needed for new support facilities. 403.3 Closer coordination between transportation and land use planning can result in better congestion management, more efficient use of transit and parking, and transportation infrastructure that is sensitive and complementary to its surrounding context. 403.4 Assessing and measuring the transportation impacts of land use decisions is also an important part of integrated land use and transportation planning. New development generates new trips—be they auto trips, transit trips, or pedestrian and bicycle trips. Major land use changes such as the development of large housing complexes or office buildings must be evaluated for their impacts on existing and planned CITYWIDE ELEMENTS COMPREHENSIVE PLAN DISTRICT ELEMENTS ADOPTED 12/19/06 P. 1-79 transportation infrastructure to ensure that the network can function adequately when the projects are completed. New methods of managing transportation impacts, such as transportation demand management (discussed later in Section 4.3 of this chapter) must be pursued in lieu of simply building more roads. 403.5 In the past, the traditional way of measuring traffic impacts was to use a series of lettered grades (A through F) based on factors such as vehicle speed, the volume of cars that pass along a street compared to the street’s capacity, or the length of time for a car to pass through an intersection. These Level of Service (LOS) standards continue to be widely used in the suburbs, where most trips are made by car. But traditional LOS measures are not appropriate in a built out city, where widening streets to increase capacity is rarely an option (or a desired outcome In the District, level of service measures must integrate vehicular, bicycle, pedestrian and transit travel. The benchmark should be the number of people that can pass along a corridor or through an intersection rather than just the number of cars. 403.6 [Photo Caption: In the District, level of service measures must integrate vehicular, bicycle, pedestrian and transit travel. The benchmark should be the number of people that can pass along a corridor or through an intersection rather than just the number of cars.] Policy T-1.1.1: Transportation Impact Assessment Require full environmental impact statements for major transportation projects, including new roadways, bridges, transit systems, road design changes, and rerouting of traffic from roads classified as principal arterials or higher onto minor arterials or neighborhood streets with lesser volumes. 403.7 Policy T-1.1.2: Land Use Impact Assessment Assess the transportation impacts of development projects using multi-modal standards rather than traditional vehicle standards to more accurately measure and more effectively mitigate development 91 impacts on the transportation network. 403.8 Policy T-1.1.3: Context-Sensitive Transportation Design transportation infrastructure to support current land uses as well as land use goals for compact, accessible neighborhoods. Make the design and scale of transportation facilities compatible with planned land uses. 403.9 Policy T-1.1.4: Transit-Oriented Development Support transit-oriented development by investing in pedestrian-oriented transportation improvements at or around transit stations, major bus corridors, and transfer points. 403.10 See also Section LU-1.3 of the Land Use Element for transit-oriented development policies Policy T-1.1.5: Joint Development Attract new riders to the transit system by fostering transit-supportive commercial and residential joint development projects on Washington Metropolitan Area Transit Authority (WMATA) owned or controlled land and on private properties adjacent to Metrorail stations. 403.11 Policy T-1.1.6: Transportation Support Facilities Preserve existing transportation infrastructure support facilities where feasible and locate new, efficient support facility locations for storage and/or maintenance for Metrobus, commuter bus, tour bus, Metrorail, streetcar, commuter rail, and intercity rail. 403.12 CITYWIDE ELEMENTS COMPREHENSIVE PLAN DISTRICT ELEMENTS ADOPTED 12/19/06 P. 1-80 Action T-1.1-A: Transportation Measures of Effectiveness Develop new measures of effectiveness such as a multi-modal level of service standard to quantify transportation service and assess land use impacts on the transportation system. 403.13 Action T-1.1-B: Transportation Improvements Require transportation demand management measures and transportation support facilities such as crosswalks, bus shelters, and bicycle facilities in large development projects and major trip generators, including projects that go through the Planned Unit Development (PUD) Process. 403.14 Please consult the Land Use and Economic Development Elements for additional policies and actions on transit-oriented development. Policies on parking are included in Section 3.2 of this Element and in the Land Use Element. Please see Section T-3.1 for additional policies on transportation demand management. T-1.2 Transforming Corridors 404 Our avenues and boulevards are much more than simple transportation routes. They are a legacy of the 1791 L’Enfant Plan and are still one of the city’s most distinctive features. They were designed to be beautiful corridors lined with distinctive buildings affording dramatic vistas for those passing by. Today, these corridors handle hundreds of thousands of private vehicles each day as well as bicycles, trucks, and buses. 404.1 [PULLQUOTE: As the gateways to our communities, the District’s corridors should once again become the centers of civic and economic life for surrounding neighborhoods and serve as vital transportation corridors.] Different corridors in the city serve different functions. Some, like New York Avenue, carry heavy truck and commuter traffic. Others have wide sidewalks that provide a safe and pleasant environment for pedestrians. Still others were once vital shopping streets or streetcar lines that today have lost their neighborhood-serving activities and are checkered by drive-through and auto-oriented uses. As the gateways to our communities, the District’s corridors should once again become the centers of civic 92 and economic life for surrounding neighborhoods and serve as vital transportation corridors. The challenge facing the District as it plans for and reinvests in its corridors is to balance the various transportation modes, tailor its transportation strategies to recognize the function of each major street, and foster economic growth. 404.2 Improvement of the city’s corridors—particularly public space along city streets—is an important part of the ongoing “Great Streets” initiative. Great Streets applies a multidisciplinary approach to corridor improvement, comprised of public realm investments, land use plans, public safety strategies, and economic development assistance. Among other things, the initiative includes the construction of new sidewalks, lighting, signage and crosswalks. Such improvements are being used to leverage further investment in landscaping and public space by the private sector. 404.3 The Great Streets Initiative is a partnership of the District Department of Transportation (DDOT the Deputy Mayor for Planning and Economic Development (DMPED the Office of Planning (OP the Department of Parks and Recreation (DPR and Neighborhood Services Coordinators (NSC among many others. In its first phase the program concentrates on six designated corridors. These corridors are identified in the Land Use Element and include Georgia Avenue NW and 7th Street NW from Eastern Avenue to Mt. Vernon Square H Street NE and Benning Road NE from North Capitol Street to Southern Avenue CITYWIDE ELEMENTS COMPREHENSIVE PLAN DISTRICT ELEMENTS ADOPTED 12/19/06 P. 1-81 Nannie Helen Burroughs Avenue NE from Kenilworth Avenue to Eastern Avenue Minnesota Avenue NE/SE from Sheriff Road NE to Good Hope Road SE Pennsylvania Avenue SE from the Capitol complex to Southern Avenue Martin Luther King Jr. Avenue SE and South Capitol Street from Good Hope Road to Southern Avenue. 404.4 New corridors may be added to the Great Streets program in the future. 404.5 [Photo Caption: Through the Great Streets Initiative, the District will seek private and non-profit developers for key parcels like the historic Howard Theater. Sites like these could serve as catalysis for transforming the District’s corridors.] Policy T-1.2.1: Boulevard Improvements Continue to work across District agencies to beautify and stabilize selected boulevards by implementing coordinated transportation, economic development, and urban design improvements. 404.6 Policy T-1.2.2: Targeted Investment Target planning and public investment toward the specific corridors with the greatest potential to foster neighborhood improvements and enhance connectivity across the city. 404.7 Policy T-1.2.3: Discouraging Auto-Oriented Uses Discourage certain uses, like “drive-through” businesses or stores with large surface parking lots, along key boulevards and pedestrian streets, and minimize the number of curb cuts in new developments. Curb cuts and multiple vehicle access points break-up the sidewalk, reduce pedestrian safety, and detract from pedestrian-oriented retail and residential areas. 404.8 Action T-1.2-A: Cross-Town Boulevards Evaluate the cross-town boulevards that link the east and west sides of the city including Florida Avenue, Michigan Avenue, and Military Road/ Missouri Avenue, to determine improvements that will facilitate cross-town movement. 404.9 Please consult the Urban Design Element for additional policies and actions on streetscape and 93 design standards for corridors. T-1.3 Regional Smart Growth Solutions 405 While this Transportation Element is focused on the District, transportation issues do not stop at jurisdictional boundaries. As the core of the region, the District has a high level of interest in transportation issues being addressed at a regional level. Consistently ranked among the top three most congested areas in the nation, and one with very high levels of auto-related air pollution, the Washington region must work cooperatively to promote more environmentally responsible transportation. Continued strong regional action on expanding transit, and smart growth land use policies, are critical for both our transportation system and the environment. 405.1 In 2006, COG released its Regional Mobility and Accessibility Study, examining the impacts of projected regional growth between 2000 and 2030 on the metropolitan transportation system—and exploring alternatives to reduce future congestion. The study found that daily vehicle miles traveled in the region are projected to grow by 37 percent by 2030, while freeway and arterial lane miles are projected to grow by only 16 percent. As a result, most of the beltway will reach “stop and go” conditions (with average speeds less than 30 MPH) and metro trains and platforms will be packed. The key finding of the COG CITYWIDE ELEMENTS COMPREHENSIVE PLAN DISTRICT ELEMENTS ADOPTED 12/19/06 P. 1-82 study is that long-term increases in congestion can be reduced by adjusting local land use plans to better match the transportation system, shifting jobs to the east side of the region, and encouraging housing closer to the region’s job centers. 405.2 [PULLQUOTE: Daily vehicle miles traveled in the region are projected to grow by 37 percent by 2030, while freeway and arterial lane miles are projected to grow by only 16 percent. As a result, most of the beltway will reach “stop and go” conditions, with average speeds less than 30 MPH] A regional strategy of promoting infill, mixed-use and transit-oriented development in urbanized areas is needed to ensure transportation efficiency both in the District and the region. A robust and meaningful dialogue that involves federal, state, and local leaders is absolutely essential. This dialogue should focus on improving the jobs/housing balance, investing in transit, and limiting urban sprawl on the region’s frontier. Among other things, the District should establish direct avenues of communcation with the planning, zoning, transportation, and economic development agencies of immediately surrounding jurisdictions. 405.3 Existing trip patterns reflect the District’s role as the region’s major employment destination. In 2000, approximately 70 percent of persons working in the District commuted in from the suburbs. Of these, some 39 percent drove alone, 21 percent carpooled or vanpooled, and 40 percent used transit. Moreover, a recent Council of Governments study found that approximately 25 percent of the traffic entering the District at key points from Maryland and Virginia is using the District as “short cut” and does not have a destination within District boundaries. 405.4 The Technical Report on Transportation developed as part of the revision of the Comprehensive Plan includes an analysis of the origins and destinations of work trips between each of the District’s ten 94 planning areas and the region’s major employment centers, including Downtown Washington. Figure 4.1 compares the percentages of work trips from each of the city’s 10 planning areas that stay within that planning area, go to Central Washington, go to other areas within the District, or leave the District each day. 405.5 [Insert Figure 4.1: Destination of Work Trips Originating in Each of the District’s 10 Planning Areas] [Numeric table to be replaced with stacked bar chart in the Final printed plan] Within Area Central DC Other DC RACS Other Suburbs Total Capitol Hill 2,111 9,221 5,104 2,088 4,013 22,536 Central Washington n/a 3,333 1,921 466 1,151 6,871 Far NE/ SE 1,338 8,569 7,501 1,829 5,700 24,937 Far SE/ SW 1,341 4,915 5,663 1,496 4,405 17,821 Lower Anacostia Waterfront/ Near SW 570 3,061 2,032 614 1,495 7,772 Mid-City 3,455 13,359 11,329 2,324 7,077 37,543 Near Northwest 7,709 15,623 6,516 2,877 6,322 39,048 Rock Creek East 2,540 9,024 8,615 2,238 7,362 29,779 Rock Creek West 5,721 18,743 9,282 3,302 8,905 45,953 Upper Northeast 2,575 7,084 6,211 1,591 5,064 22,525 Total 24,786 86,849 57,962 17,234 46,429 232,260 RACS= Regional activity centers (outside DC) Source: DC Office of Planning, 2006 CITYWIDE ELEMENTS COMPREHENSIVE PLAN DISTRICT ELEMENTS ADOPTED 12/19/06 P. 1-83 Graphic Caption: The height of each bar indicates the number of employed residents in each of the city’s 10 Planning Areas. The shading shows where residents in each area actually worked. Nearly 40 percent of the city’s employed residents work in Central Washington. 405.7 Approximately 29 percent of the District’s residents commute to suburban destinations, with about 10 percent of these trips going to large “regional activity centers” such as Tysons Corners, Silver Spring, Bethesda, and Rosslyn. Near Northwest had the highest percentage of resident work trips remaining within the District, at 77 percent. However, this was not markedly different from other planning areas; Far Southeast/Southwest had the lowest percentage of resident work trips that remained within the District, at 66 percent. 405.8 Figure 4.2 illustrates the origins of daily work trips to each Planning Area of the District, comparing trips by District workers with trips from outlying jurisdictions. The figure indicates that the vast majority of both resident and non-resident commuters are traveling to Central Washington. In fact, Central Washington is the destination for approximately 61 percent of the work trips that come from outside the District. Table 4.3 reflects the existing levels of demand for each mode of transportation for commuters working in the District. More than 50 percent of the commuters to Central Washington use transit or carpool. 405.9 [PULLQUOTE: Approximately 29 percent of the District’s residents commute to suburban destinations, with about 10 percent of these trips going to large “regional activity centers” such as Tysons 95 Corners, Silver Spring, Bethesda, and Rosslyn.

Advocate for—and take a leadership role in—the preparation of a 50-year Regional Transportation Infrastructure Study that takes a broad-based look at these needs, taking into account expected growth patterns and emerging technologies. 405.17 CITYWIDE ELEMENTS COMPREHENSIVE PLAN DISTRICT ELEMENTS ADOPTED 12/19/06 P. 1-85 T-2 Multi-Modal Transportation Choices 406 The District has one of the most balanced transportation systems in the country. It is ranked second only to New York in terms of the percentage of residents who take public transportation, and second only to Boston in the percentage who walk to work. Thirty-seven percent of the District’s households have no automobile. Providing transportation choices that are more efficient and environmentally friendly than driving such as walking, bicycling, and public transit is a key goal of the Comprehensive Plan. 406.1 [PULLQUOTE: Providing transportation choices that are towards more efficient and environmentally friendly than driving such as walking, bicycling, and public transit is a key goal of the Comprehensive Plan] T-2.1 Transit Accessibility 407 The District and its region are served by the second largest rail transit system and the fifth largest bus network in the United States. The bus and rail systems are operated by the Washington Metropolitan Area Transit Authority (WMATA which provides service throughout the Washington region. 407.1 WMATA was created in 1967 by an Interstate Compact to plan, develop, build, finance and operate a balanced regional transportation system in the National Capital area. Construction of the planned 103- mile Metrorail system began in 1969 and was largely funded by the federal government. The first phase of Metrorail began operation in 1976 and was completed in early 2001. In 2004, three new stations opened—two extended the Blue Line east of the Beltway and the first infill station (New York Avenue) opened on the Red Line. The system now totals 106 miles, 38.3 miles of which are located within the District itself. Close to half of the stations on the system 40 of 86 are located in the District. The Metrorail system is shown in Map 4.1. While much of the city is within ½ mile of a station, some areas such as Georgetown, the New York Avenue corridor, and Bolling Air Force Base, are not. 407.2 [INSERT: Map 4.1: Metrorail System 407.3] 97 [Photo caption: The Metrobus buses travel about 163,500 miles on an average weekday carrying about 431,000 trips. Approximately 55 percent of these trips are within the District.] As the core of the region and the hub of the Metrorail system, much of WMATA’s transit usage centers on the District. In May 2005, the total average weekday boardings at all Metrorail stations was 687,000. Nearly 60 percent of these boardings occurred at District stations. 407.4 Metrorail trains often fill to capacity in the suburbs in peak periods, leaving little space for District residents by the time trains arrive in the city. Downtown station platforms are congested. The District and WMATA are studying the feasibility of underground pedestrian connections between Gallery Place/Metro Center and Farragut North/Farragut West to relieve overcrowding. 407.5 The WMATA Core Capacity Study investigated options to increase capacity of the system, but there are several obstacles to making long-term, large-scale improvements. For instance, the Orange and Blue Lines share a track through downtown Washington, greatly limiting the capacity of both lines. Likewise, the interlinking of the Green and Yellow Lines between L’Enfant Plaza and the Convention Center discourages capacity increases on either of those lines. Adding tracks in these areas would require extraordinary costs and service disruption. 407.6 Because of the very high cost of building entirely new Metrorail subway lines within the District, the city is instead proposing better connections to and among the various spokes of the Metrorail system with CITYWIDE ELEMENTS COMPREHENSIVE PLAN DISTRICT ELEMENTS ADOPTED 12/19/06 P. 1-86 investments in surface transit. These improvements include bus rapid transit, streetcar, and improvements to local bus service through the use of new technologies. In addition the city is working with WMATA to make more efficient use of existing infrastructure through measures such as increasing train lengths from six cars to eight cars. The increased train length would add about one-third more capacity to each train, greatly helping to alleviate short-term congestion problems in the system. This technique would not require any changes to railroad or station infrastructure, although power delivery infrastructure would need to be upgraded and new rail cars would need to be acquired. 407.7 WMATA also operates the Metrobus regional bus service. The buses run approximately 163,500 miles on an average weekday carrying about 431,000 trips. Approximately 55 percent of these trips are within the District. Metrobus operates 157 major routes on 1,442 miles of roadway throughout the metropolitan area. Within the District, Metrobus operates 58 major bus lines on 298 miles of roadway or 27 percent of the roadway system. Average weekday ridership on these lines ranges from about 200 persons to over 22,000 persons. Some of the high volume bus routes include Pennsylvania Avenue (routes 30, 32, 34, 36 14th Street NW (routes 52, 53, 54 and Georgia Avenue – 7th Street (routes 70, 71 407.8 WMATA faces complex and unique funding and budgetary challenges to maintain and operate the transit system. Research shows that over half of the total capital spending for other transit systems in other cities comes from dedicated sources of one kind or another. However, WMATA receives no funding from such sources. For operations spending, other transit systems obtain about one-third of their total funding from dedicated sources. For WMATA, it is less than two percent. Most of WMATA’s operating budget 98 comes from direct subsidy payments from cities and counties in the region, including the District. The amounts vary from year to year. 407.9 WMATA needs a stable, reliable, and dedicated revenue source to take the pressure off passenger fares and the local governments’ annual subsidy. The District will continue to actively collaborate with jurisdictions throughout the region and with the federal government to pursue a dedicated and more stable revenue stream, such as a sales tax. 407.10 [PULLQUOTE: WMATA needs a stable, reliable, and dedicated revenue source to take the pressure off passenger fares and the local governments’ annual subsidy. The District will continue to actively collaborate with jurisdictions throughout the region and with the federal government to pursue a dedicated and more stable revenue stream, such as a sales tax.] The District is served by a number of regional bus carriers in addition to Metrobus. In Maryland, these include MTA Commuter Bus, Dillon, Eyre, and Keller Transportation. In Virginia, these include Lee Coaches, National Coach, Quick’s, Loudoun County Commuter Bus, and PRTC OmniRide. A number of private bus services also provide circulation within the District for schools, hospitals, universities, and other areas or attractions. The District is also served by regional commuter rail (discussed in the next section 407.11 In addition to the regional WMATA bus service, the District began the DC Circulator service in July 2005 with 29 new buses on two routes linking Union Station with the Washington Convention Center and Georgetown via K Street, as well as connecting the Convention Center to the Southwest Waterfront through Downtown and the National Mall. A third route was added in March 2006 to expand circulator service around the National Mall. 407.12 CITYWIDE ELEMENTS COMPREHENSIVE PLAN DISTRICT ELEMENTS ADOPTED 12/19/06 P. 1-87 Ongoing and Planned Transit Improvements The District is working to increase transit options for intra-District trips. These options will include a variety of transit technologies including neighborhood circulators, streetcars, bus rapid transit, and rapid bus. The intra-District system will be designed to be cohesive, supplement and complement existing Metro services, and support District land use objectives. 407.13 Map 4.2 illustrates the corridors recommended in the 2005 District of Columbia Alternatives Analysis (DCAA The DCAA examined the major travel corridors in the District and provided analysis of their propensity to support premium transit service. Recommended transit technologies were also provided. As the DCAA is refined, a system plan will be developed that reflects a timeline for its implementation. 407.14 Some aspects of the DCAA are already being implemented. Planning for “Phase 1 DC Streetcar” has begun and service is expected to begin in Summer 2007. Plans for integrating the rail construction with the streetscape project on H Street NE are also underway. Bus Rapid Transit (BRT) is currently being planned for the K Street corridor and rapid bus service is scheduled to be implemented on Georgia and Pennsylvania Avenues in 2007 407.15 Other ongoing transit improvement initiatives include a) K Street Busway: The busway would provide two travel lanes for exclusive use by buses between 99 Washington Circle and Mount Vernon Square, with further extensions to Georgetown in the west and Union Station in the east. The busway is scheduled to open in 2008 b) Circulator: There are two to three additional planned Circulator routes. One route would likely provide service to major points of interest along the western portion of the National Mall, such as the Lincoln Memorial, Washington Monument, and Jefferson Memorial. A second, larger loop route would likely connect Union Station with the US Capitol Building, the White House, Metro Center, and Foggy Bottom c) Water Taxis: Water taxis are proposed to extend from the mouth of Rock Creek on the Potomac River to Children’s Island on the Anacostia River, and to Ronald Reagan Washington National Airport and Old Town Alexandria, Virginia. Privately owned and operated, water taxis would load and unload passengers at docks built with public-private funding. 407.17 [BEGIN TEXT BOX, with three photos side by side] Streetcar, BRT Vehicle, Rapid Bus Vehicle The photos above illustrate three types of mass transit now under consideration in the District. Streetcars are wheeled vehicles that run on rails and operate on electricity. Bus rapid transit, or BRT, attempts to combine the reliability and service quality of a rail system (like streetcars) using bus vehicles. BRT systems often include dedicated bus lanes, allowing them to travel more quickly than conventional buses. Rapid Bus is similar to BRT in many ways. Like BRT, Rapid Bus is faster than conventional buses because the vehicles stop only at the busiest locations. Rapid Bus systems also have distinctive vehicles, stops, and color schemes to make them instantly recognizable and easy to use. They also typically feature enhanced shelters at stops, real-time passenger information, and signal prioritization. Rapid Bus vehicles, however, are often smaller than BRT vehicles and tend to look more like conventional buses than the rail-like BRT vehicles. In 2003, WMATA completed a Regional Bus Study that recommended the development of several Rapid Bus corridors in the city. 407.16 CITYWIDE ELEMENTS COMPREHENSIVE PLAN DISTRICT ELEMENTS ADOPTED 12/19/06 P. 1-88 [END TEXT BOX] Policy T-2.1.1: Transit Accessibility Work with transit providers to develop transit service that is fast, frequent, and reliable and that is accessible to the city’s residences and businesses. Pursue strategies that make transit safe, secure, comfortable, and affordable. 407.18 Policy T-2.1.2: Bus Transit Improvements Enhance bus transit service by improving scheduling and reliability, reducing travel time, providing relief for overcrowding, increasing frequency and service hours, and improving both local access and crosstown connections. 407.19 [INSERT Map 4.2: Proposed BRT/ LRT Corridors 407.20][Map corrected to match the DCAA study] Policy T-2.1.3: WMATA Funding Support the creation of dedicated, reliable funding sources for Metro, generated through the equitable participation of all jurisdictions in the region that benefit from the system. 407.21 Policy T-2.1.4: Maintenance of Transit Facilities Work with the WMATA Board to ensure that necessary investments to the transit system are made to keep it operating safely and to maximize its useful life. 407.22 Action T-2.1-A: New Streetcar or Bus Rapid Transit Lines Construct a network of new premium transit infrastructure, including bus rapid transit and streetcar lines to provide travel options, better connect the city, and improve surface-level public transportation. As needed, replace existing travel and/or parking lanes along selected major thoroughfares with new rapid 100 bus or streetcar lines to improve mobility within the city. 407.23 Action T-2.1-B: Eight-Car Trains Increase Metrorail train lengths from six cars to eight cars for rush hour commuting and other peak periods. 407.24 Action T-2.1-C: Circulator Buses In addition to the circulator bus routes planned for Downtown, consider implementing circulator routes in other areas of the city to connect residents and visitors to commercial centers and tourist attractions and to augment existing transit routes. 407.25 Action T-2.1-D: Bus Stop Improvements Improve key bus stop locations through such actions as Extending bus stop curbs to facilitate reentry into the traffic stream Moving bus stops to the far side of signalized or signed intersections where feasible Adding bus stop amenities such as user-friendly, real-time transit schedule information Improving access to bus stops via well-lit, accessible sidewalks and street crossings Utilizing GPS and other technologies to inform bus riders who are waiting for buses when the next bus will arrive 407.26 Action T-2.1-E: Financing Continue the campaign to establish a regional dedicated funding source to finance the expansion and rehabilitation of the Metrorail and Metrobus systems. 407.27 CITYWIDE ELEMENTS COMPREHENSIVE PLAN DISTRICT ELEMENTS ADOPTED 12/19/06 P. 1-89 Action T-2.1-F: College Student Metro Passes Explore potential partnerships between WMATA and local colleges and universities to provide Metro passes to college students. As part of this program, improve connections between campuses and Metrorail stations during both on- and off-peak hours. 407.28 Action T-2.1-G: Water Taxis Explore public-private and regional partnership opportunities to provide water taxis on the Potomac and Anacostia Rivers to serve close in areas around the District as well as longer-distance routes from points south such as Indian Head on the east side of the Potomac and Woodbridge on the west. In addition to improving mobility and access, water taxis and ferries provide a safe alternative for commuters and an alternate mode of transit in the event Metro service or bridge traffic is disrupted. 407.29 T-2.2 Making Multi-Modal Connections 408 Multi-modal connections refer to the links between different modes of travel, such as Metrorail, bus, and private cars. These connections can be improved by expanding Metrorail stations to allow for more effective bus and streetcar transfers, particularly as streetcars, RapidBus, and Bus Rapid Transit services become more common. Similarly, better pedestrian amenities, increased bicycle parking and more visible parking for car-share vehicles at Metrorail stations can enhance connections. 408.1 Intercity and commuter rail and bus connections are also critical to creating an efficient multimodal transportation system. Amtrak regularly runs trains into and out of Union Station, providing service along the northeastern rail corridor as well as points west and south. The District ranks third in Amtrak station passenger volume, after Philadelphia and New York City. The District is currently served by two commuter rail systems Maryland Commuter Rail (MARC which provides service from Maryland, and the Virginia Rail Expressway (VRE which provides service from Virginia. These systems provide up to 101 30,000 trips in and out of Union Station on a typical weekday on 96 trains per day. Commuter ridership has increased substantially during recent years, and continued growth of both systems is expected. 408.2 The expansion of these two intercity and commuter rail services, coupled with Metrorail and Metrobus service, will increase accessibility and enhance regional transportation options. A number of key facilities on the rail system need improvements to accommodate future ridership and enable intermodal transfers. Increased capacity at Union Station and L’Enfant Plaza is also needed to accommodate commuter rail passenger traffic for MARC and VRE riders respectively. Taxis may also provide enhanced mobility for the disabled and elderly. 408.3 Taxis are another important component of the District’s multi-modal transportation system. They provide an alternative and convenient means of travel throughout the District. In October 2005, the District launched the Taxicab Information Project (“TIP”) in an effort to move away from a zone-based fare to a meter-based fare. 408.4 [Photo Caption: Taxis are another important component of the District’s multi-modal transportation system.

However, no freeway or highway removal shall be undertaken prior to the completion of an adequate and feasible alternative traffic plan that has been approved by the District government. 408.6 Policy T-2.2.3: Airport Connections Work with other local governments in the Washington metropolitan region to maintain intermodal transportation services that ensure more efficient and convenient connections between the District and the Reagan Washington National, Baltimore/Washington Thurgood Marshall International (BWI and Washington Dulles International airports. 408.7 Policy T-2.2.4: Commuter and Intercity Rail Support the expansion of commuter and intercity rail. Intercity rail could include magnetic levitation (MAGLEV) high-speed trains that could provide access to New York in 90 minutes and to Boston in three hours. 408.8 Policy T-2.2.5: Taxi Enhancements Promote and incentivize upgrades to the city’s taxi fleet including conversion to hybrid vehicles, installation of time and distance meters, improvements in tracking and dispatching, and implementation of handicap-accessible vehicles. Particular attention should be given to improving taxi service to neighborhoods east of the Anacostia River. 408.9 Action T-2.2-A: Intermodal Centers Plan, fund, and implement the development of intermodal activity centers both at the periphery of the city and closer to Downtown. These intermodal centers should provide a “park-once” service where travelers 102 including tour buses, can park their vehicles and then travel efficiently and safely around the District by other modes. The activity centers surrounding the District’s Downtown should be located at Union Station, the Kennedy Center, and Banneker Overlook. 408.10 Action T-2.2-B: Pedestrian Connections Work in concert with WMATA to undertake pedestrian capacity and connection improvements at selected Metrorail stations, streetcar stations, and bus transfer facilities to enhance pedestrian flow, efficiency, and operations. 408.11 Action T-2.2-C: Bicycle and Car-Pool Parking Increase investment in bicycle parking and provide more visible parking for car-sharing operations at Metrorail stations, key bus stops, and future streetcar stations. 408.12 Action T-2.2-D: Commuter Rail and Bus Connections Increase capacity and connectivity at Union Station and at the L’Enfant Plaza VRE station to accommodate additional commuter rail passenger traffic and direct through-train connections between Maryland and Virginia. In addition, support continued investment in commuter bus service and in Metrorail feeder bus service throughout the region. 408.13 Action T-2.2-E: Bus Connections Promote cross-town bus services and new bus routes that connect neighborhoods to one another and to transit stations.408.14 CITYWIDE ELEMENTS COMPREHENSIVE PLAN DISTRICT ELEMENTS ADOPTED 12/19/06 P. 1-91 Action T-2.2-F: Regional Intermodal Transportation Plan Work with the other local governments in the region and the Metropolitan Washington Council of Governments to update a regional intermodal transportation plan. 408.15 T-2.3 Bicycle Access, Facilities, and Safety 409 Bicycling has long been a part of the transportation mix in the District. In the late 19th and early 20th centuries, bicyclists, pedestrians, buggies, and streetcars all shared District streets. The District’s interest in bicycling as an alternative to motorized transportation grew in the 1970s in response to the energy crisis and the first District Bicycle Plan was adopted in 1976. 409.1 The use of bicycles for transportation and recreation is increasing within the District. Between 1990 and 2000, bicycle commuting grew by 55 percent, from a 0.75 percent share to a 1.16 percent share of all District-based work trips. Continued increases in bicycling as a percent of work trips is desired. 409.2 [PULLQUOTE: The use of bicycles for transportation and recreation is increasing within the District. Between 1990 and 2000, bicycle commuting grew by 55 percent, from a 0.75 percent share to a 1.16 percent share of all District-based work trips.] Currently, the District has 17 miles of bike lanes, 50 miles of bike paths, and 64 miles of bicycle routes. The city is also working to improve bicycle connections through parks and green spaces. Map 4.3 shows the city’s bicycle trail network. 409.3 While existing conditions provide a firm foundation for bicycling, many parts of the city are not as bicycle-friendly as they should be. Many parts of the city have no bicycle facilities at all and many workplaces and other destinations have no facilities for storing or locking bicycles. 409.4 Safety is another big concern. On average there are 270 bicycle crashes in the city each year. Between 1992 and 2001, close to one-third of all fatalities from motor vehicle crashes in the District were pedestrians or bicyclists as compared to about 20 percent nationally and 27 percent for large urban areas. 409.5 In 2003, the District Department of Transportation estimated the Bicycle Level of Services (Bicycle LOS) along 400 miles of major collector and arterial streets in the District. The Department of 103 Transportation evaluated roadway lane and shoulder width, speed limit, pavement condition, and on-street parking data. The analysis found that about 70 percent of the study network received below average Bicycle LOS grades. The recently completed Bicycle Master Plan includes many recommendations to improve bicycle facilities and infrastructure and should be consulted for more detail. 409.6 Please refer to the Parks, Recreation and Open Space Element for additional policies and actions related to bicycle and pedestrian trails. Policy T-2.3.1: Better Integration of Bicycle and Pedestrian Planning Integrate bicycle and pedestrian planning and safety considerations more fully into the planning and design of District roads, transit facilities, public buildings, and parks. 409.7 Policy T-2.3.2: Bicycle Network Provide and maintain a safe, direct, and comprehensive bicycle network connecting neighborhoods, employment locations, public facilities, transit stations, parks and other key destinations.

However, there are still streets without sidewalks and a backlog of sidewalks needing repair. Pedestrian safety is also a big challenge. There are roughly 550 collisions between cars and pedestrians in the city each year. 410.2 Improvements to pedestrian facilities can enhance the quality of the walking and public transit environments, and foster greater use of both modes. Improvements should focus on reductions in the CITYWIDE ELEMENTS COMPREHENSIVE PLAN DISTRICT ELEMENTS ADOPTED 12/19/06 P. 1-93 number and severity of pedestrian-vehicle conflict points, clarified pedestrian routing, widened sidewalks, and improved aesthetic features such as landscaping. 410.3 Encouraging walking will bring many benefits to the District. It will provide convenient and affordable transportation options, reduce vehicular-travel and related pollution, and improve the health and fitness of District residents. 410.4 [Photo Caption: Encouraging walking will bring many benefits to the District.

Maintain sidewalk surfaces and elevations so that disabled or elderly pedestrians can safely use them. 410.8 Action T-2.4-A: Pedestrian Signal Timings Review timing on pedestrian signals to ensure that adequate time is provided for crossing, in particular for locations with a large elderly population. 410.9 Action T-2.4-B: Sidewalks Install sidewalks on all major streets throughout the District where there are missing links. Continue to monitor the sidewalk network for needed improvements. Consult with ANCs and community organizations as plans for sidewalk construction are developed. 410.10 Action T-2.4-C: Innovative Technologies for Pedestrian Movement Explore the use of innovative technology to improve pedestrian movement, such as personal transportation systems and enhanced sidewalk materials. 410.11 Action T-2.4-D: Pedestrian Access on Bridges Ensure that the redesign and/or reconstruction of bridges, particularly those crossing the Anacostia River, includes improved provisions for pedestrians, including wider sidewalks, adequate separation between 105 vehicle traffic and sidewalks, guard rails, pedestrian-scaled lighting, and easy grade transitions. 410.12 CITYWIDE ELEMENTS COMPREHENSIVE PLAN DISTRICT ELEMENTS ADOPTED 12/19/06 P. 1-94 T-2.5 Roadway System and Auto Movement 411 The District’s roadway system consists of 1,153 miles of roadway, 229 vehicular and pedestrian bridges, and approximately 7,700 intersections. Approximately 17 percent of these intersections are signalized, with about one in three signalized intersections located within the downtown area. 411.1 The roadways in the District are categorized by function, ranging from interstates and other freeways, which provide the highest degree of travel mobility, to local streets, which provide the highest level of access to land uses. Map 4.4 shows the existing roadway system based on a functional classification system described in Table 4.4. 411.2 Increases in funding for street maintenance since the mid-1990s have allowed the District to continually improve the condition of its roadway pavement. The District continually monitors and rates the condition of its roadways and bridges. 411.3 Traffic congestion on the District’s roadway network occurs primarily on the radial principal arterial roadways. Figure 4.3 illustrates traffic volumes on major streets and highways. The flow of traffic is greatly influenced by north-south movements along the I-95 corridor feeding into I-295 and I-395. These highways carry the heaviest daily traffic volumes in the District with an average of approximately 193,000 daily trips on I-395 and 80,000 on I-295. In addition, the limited number of crossings over the Potomac and Anacostia rivers generates higher volumes of traffic at these gateways than their counterparts in the northern portion of the District. 411.4 Table 4.4: Existing Roadway System Functional Classification 411.5 Road Type Description Freeways and Expressways These roadways, which comprise 54 miles or approximately five percent of the total roadway miles in the District, are controlled access facilities. Access is via interchange ramps and these roadways typically do not provide direct access to adjacent land uses. Principal Arterials These roadways, comprising 92 miles or approximately eight percent of the District’s roadway system, typically serve major activity centers and serve longer trip lengths than the roadway types listed below. The freeways and principal arterials function as the primary commuter routes and form the backbone of the overall roadway system. Freeways and principal arterials typically carry between 40 and 60 percent of a city’s total traffic volumes. Minor Arterials Minor arterials account for 173 miles, or approximately 15 percent of the total roadway system. These roadways serve short to medium length trips, with a greater emphasis on mobility than direct access. In a typical network, minor arterials make up 15 to 25 percent of the mileage and carry 15 to 40 percent of the total traffic. Collectors The role of collectors is to move traffic from local streets to the arterials. Collectors will often intersect arterials at signalized intersections. Local roads will intersect collectors at stop signs. Collectors make up 152 miles, or 13 percent, of the District’s roadway system. Local Roads These roads typically make up the majority of the transportation network as measured by road miles. They carry between 10 and 30 percent of all traffic. The primary role of local roads is to provide access to adjacent land uses, with ideally a very limited role in terms of traffic mobility. Approximately 60 percent, or 682 miles, of the District’s roadway system is classified as local The District has 202 roadway bridges that are located on roads classified as collector and above, 12 bridges on the local roadway system, and 15 pedestrian bridges. Because of their relatively high construction and maintenance cost, bridges represent a substantial portion of the total roadway system investment. [INSERT Map 4.4: Roadway System by Functional Classification 411.6] [Note: Map amended to 106 show Independence and Maine Avenues as Principal Arterials rather than freeways, and to use different symbology to depict the city limits so that the boundary avenues are visible.] CITYWIDE ELEMENTS COMPREHENSIVE PLAN DISTRICT ELEMENTS ADOPTED 12/19/06 P. 1-95 [INSERT Figure 4.3: Existing District Traffic Volumes, 2003 411.7] Examples of heavy volumes from the south include 93,000 daily trips across the Anacostia River on the Pennsylvania Avenue Bridge, 64,000 trips across the Potomac on the Key Bridge, and 100,000 trips across the Theodore Roosevelt Bridge, also over the Potomac. These volumes can be contrasted with volumes coming into the city from the north and northeast, which include 41,000 daily trips on Connecticut Avenue, 18,000 daily trips on Georgia Avenue, 37,000 daily trips on North Capitol Street, and more than 100,000 daily trips on New York Avenue. 411.8 Since the District is a densely developed city with an historic built environment, the city does not foresee making significant investments in road widening to accommodate more autos. Instead, the District will continue to manage existing roadway resources and provide for viable transportation choices throughout the city. Some of the roadway and bridge investments the city is planning to make within the next five to eight years include a) Rehabilitating the existing Frederick Douglass Memorial Bridge through structural steel repairs, lighting improvements, and preventive maintenance b) Constructing a tunnel between I-295 east of the Anacostia River and the existing I-395 Third Street tunnel to carry regional through traffic beneath the South Capitol Street corridor and to replace the Southeast Freeway c) Creating a traffic circle at the intersection of Potomac Avenue and South Capitol Street (d) Extending Potomac Avenue to 2nd Street SE on the east and to Fort McNair on the west e) Reconfiguring the underpass arrangement at the intersection of M and South Capitol Streets f) Redesigning South Capitol Street for a continuous, at-grade 130-foot street section as originally specified in the L’Enfant Plan, with a narrow median g) Constructing an island to channelize traffic onto and off of Fairlawn Avenue at Pennsylvania Avenue (h) Placing a directional ramp on the northwestern quadrant of Pennsylvania Avenue, SE/Anacostia Freeway (I-295) interchange (i) Placing a single point diamond interchange at Pennsylvania Avenue, SE/ Anacostia Freeway (I- 295) 411.9 As part of the Comprehensive Plan revision, an analysis of the transportation impacts of anticipated 20- year land use and transportation changes was conducted. The analysis projected a 20 to 25 percent increase in the total number of transit trips by 2025, and about an 11 percent increase in the total number of vehicle trips. Much of the increase is associated with off-peak travel and a “spreading” of the commute period over additional hours of the day. Vehicle congestion will increase on several corridors. The analysis concluded that new transportation demand management measures and transit improvements will be needed, both in the city and in the region, to keep the system functioning adequately. 411.10 [PULLQUOTE: An analysis of the transportation impacts of anticipated 20-year land use and transportation changes concluded that new transportation demand management measures and transit improvements will be needed, both in the city and in the region, to keep the system functioning adequately.] [BEGIN SIDEBAR] The Concept of Induced Demand 411.18 Research shows that urban traffic congestion tends to maintain a self-limiting equilibrium: vehicle 107 traffic volumes increase to fill available capacity until congestion limits further growth. Any time a consumer CITYWIDE ELEMENTS COMPREHENSIVE PLAN DISTRICT ELEMENTS ADOPTED 12/19/06 P. 1-96 makes a travel decision based on congestion (“Should I run that errand now? No, I’ll wait until later when traffic will be lighter”) they contribute to this self-limiting equilibrium. Travel that would not occur if roads are congested, but will occur if roads become less congested, is called induced travel demand. Increasing road capacity, or reducing vehicle use by a small group, creates additional road space that is filled with induced demand. [END SIDEBAR] Policy T-2.5.1: Creating Multi-Modal Corridors Transform key District arterials into multi-modal corridors that incorporate and balance a variety of mode choices including bus or streetcar, bicycle, pedestrian and auto.411.11 Policy T-2.5.2: Managing Roadway Capacity Manage the capacity of principal arterials within existing limits rather than increasing roadway capacity to meet induced demand for travel by car (See text box Increase auto capacity on roadways only if needed to improve the safety of all travelers, improve connectivity of the multi-modal transportation network, or improve targeted connections to regional roadways. 411.12 Policy T-2.5.3: Road and Bridge Maintenance Maintain the road and bridge system to keep it operating safely and efficiently and to maximize its useful life. 411.13 Policy T-2.5.4: Traffic Management Establish traffic management strategies that separate local traffic from commuter or through-traffic and reduce the intrusion of trucks, commuter traffic, and “cut-through” traffic on residential streets. 411.14 Action T-2.5-A: Maintenance Funds Provide sufficient funding sources to maintain, and repair the District’s system of streets and alleys, including its street lights and traffic control systems, bridges, street trees, and other streetscape improvements. 411.15 Action T-2.5-B: Signal Timing Adjustments Regularly evaluate the need for adjustments to traffic signal timing to minimize unnecessary automobile idling. 411.16 Action T-2.5-C: Update the Functional Classification System Update the functional classification of the city’s roadways to reflect a multi-modal approach that better integrates pedestrians, bicyclists, and transit vehicles. Ensure that the updated system complies with federal laws and that changes will not reduce available funding. 411.17 T-2.6 Addressing Special Needs 412 Multi-modal transportation options are critical for special needs populations who cannot drive or do not have access to a car. Special needs transportation can be a lifeline for a senior citizen who needs to go to a medical appointment, for a person with a disability who needs to go to work, or a low-income worker who needs to get his or her children to childcare or go grocery shopping. Without alternatives to cars, a significant portion of the population may be unable to lead independent lives. 412.1 Policy T-2.6.1: Special Needs Address the transportation needs of all District residents, including those with special physical 108 requirements and trip needs, such as access to medical centers or senior centers. 412.2 CITYWIDE ELEMENTS COMPREHENSIVE PLAN DISTRICT ELEMENTS ADOPTED 12/19/06 P. 1-97 Policy T-2.6.2: Transit Needs Establish, expand, or continue assistance for transit-dependent groups in the District, including the elderly, students, school age children, and persons whose situations require special services, including the homeless. 412.3 Action T-2.6-A: Public Improvements Invest in public improvements, such as curb inclines aimed at increasing pedestrian mobility, particularly for the elderly and people with disabilities. 412.4 Action T-2.6-B: Shuttle Services Supplement basic public transit services with shuttle and minibuses to provide service for transitdependent groups, including the elderly, people with disabilities, school age children, and residents in areas that cannot viably be served by conventional buses. 412.5 T-3.0 Transportation System Efficiency and Management 413 With the costs of providing new transportation facilities on the rise, the District must constantly look for ways to reduce travel demand as well as to more effectively use its existing and future transportation systems. This section of the Element addresses Transportation Demand Management (TDM curbside management and parking, truck and tour bus movement, and travel information. 413.1 T-3.1 Transportation Demand Management 414 Transportation Demand Management (TDM) refers to a series of transportation strategies that are designed to maximize the people-moving capability of the transportation system by increasing the number of persons in a vehicle, increasing transit ridership, or influencing the time of (or need to) travel. To accomplish such changes, TDM programs rely on incentives or disincentives to make shifts in travel behavior more attractive. 414.1 The primary purpose of TDM is to reduce the number of vehicles using the road system while providing a variety of mobility options to those who wish to travel. Typical TDM programs include Carpooling and vanpooling, employee shuttles, and improvements which encourage bicycling and walking Financial incentives, such as preferential parking for ridesharers and transit subsidies Congestion avoidance strategies, such as compressed work weeks, flexible work schedules, and telecommuting 414.2 TDM strategies are particularly useful during peak period travel times when demand is the greatest. The Washington, DC metropolitan region is a leader in developing and implementing such strategies. Some of the regional TDM strategies already in place include telework centers, vanpool programs, guaranteed ride home programs, and transit incentive programs. 414.3 [PULLQUOTE: The Washington, DC metropolitan region is a leader in developing and implementing Transportation Demand Management strategies. Some of the regional TDM strategies already in place include telework centers, vanpool programs, guaranteed ride home programs, and transit incentive programs.] CITYWIDE ELEMENTS COMPREHENSIVE PLAN DISTRICT ELEMENTS ADOPTED 12/19/06 P. 1-98 The federal government employs approximately 370,000 people in the National Capital Region. As the region’s largest employer, the federal government has a strong interest in improving the quality of transportation services and infrastructure. It is in a unique position to provide leadership in TDM 109 programs that can accommodate the travel needs of its workforce while simultaneously setting the standard for the region as a whole. Through its mandatory regional transit subsidy program, the federal government provided more than $72 million in transit subsidies for federal employees in 2001. 414.4 The District supports all these initiatives and also has a number of its own TDM measures in place. For instance, it is helping to educate the public about car-sharing—a service that allows members to rent cars at an hourly rate, rather than the traditional daily rate charged by rental companies. Car-sharing vehicles are scattered throughout the city for quick and easy access. In this manner, car-sharing allows people who do not own a vehicle to rent one on an occasional basis. This reduces the need to own and drive vehicles within the District. To incentivize the use of shared cars and encourage the private sector to expand car-sharing programs, the District has designated strategic curbside parking spaces for these vehicles, accompanied with educational brochures to help explain this service to the public. The District is also implementing TDM initiatives through a pilot program that focuses on the District government, public schools, and major employers throughout the city. 414.5 Roadway pricing is another strategy to manage transportation demand. Research indicates that 75 to 80 percent or more of the costs of driving are “external” costs such as noise and air pollution. Over the long term, recovering these costs will serve to level the playing field for all modes of travel. The region’s motorists and residents currently pay the full cost of transportation through a variety of indirect means. Distributing these costs among transportation users and making these costs more apparent to motorists will ultimately help to shift travel both in the District and throughout the region to modes that are most efficient in terms of lowest overall costs. The District is investigating how to implement roadway pricing, particularly strategies targeting those drivers who “cut through” the District with neither a starting nor an ending point within District boundaries. 414.6 [BEGIN SIDEBAR] Roadway Pricing Approaches 414.10 New technologies are making roadway pricing more feasible and economical. The range of roadway pricing approaches include cordon fees (used most notably in London and Singapore) where motorists are charged for entering the central portion of the city via electronically-read debit cards. Other options include methods to measure miles traveled on particular roads (again using electronic means) and assessing per-mile charges based on such variables as wear-and-tear on the roadway system, air and noise pollution, imposition of congestion, etc. Pricing strategies can also vary depending on the time of day, the level of congestion, and other parameters. [END SIDEBAR] Policy T-3.1.1: Transportation Demand Management (TDM) Programs Provide, support, and promote programs and strategies aimed at reducing the number of car trips and miles driven (for work and non-work purposes) to increase the efficiency of the transportation system. 414.7 Policy T-3.1.2: Regional TDM Efforts Continue to pursue TDM strategies at the regional level and work with regional and federal partners to promote a coordinated, integrated transportation system. 414.8 110 CITYWIDE ELEMENTS COMPREHENSIVE PLAN DISTRICT ELEMENTS ADOPTED 12/19/06 P. 1-99 Policy T-3.1.3: Car-Sharing Encourage the expansion of car-sharing services as an alternative to private vehicle ownership. 414.9 Action T-3.1-A: TDM Strategies Develop strategies and requirements that reduce rush hour traffic by promoting flextime, carpooling, transit use; encouraging the formation of Transportation Management Associations; and undertaking other measures that reduce vehicular trips, particularly during peak travel periods. Identify TDM measures and plans as appropriate conditions for large development approval. Transportation Management Plans should identify quantifiable reductions in vehicle trips and commit to measures to achieve those reductions. Encourage the federal and District governments to explore the creation of a staggered workday for particular departments and agencies in an effort to reduce congestion. 414.11 Action T-3.1-B: Roadway Pricing Implement roadway pricing between now and the year 2030 in three phases, as follows: Phase 1: Continually monitor direct and external roadway costs to gain a more accurate estimate of the true cost of driving for motorists; Phase 2: Develop a system to identify those who drive entirely through the District without stopping (i.e those who are not living in, working in, or visiting the city as well as a mechanism to charge these motorists for the external costs that they are imposing on the District’s transportation system; and Phase 3: Continually monitor state-of-the-art roadway pricing techniques and technologies, and work cooperatively with neighboring jurisdictions to implement roadway pricing programs that better transfer the full costs of driving to motorists. This could include higher costs for heavier and higher emission vehicles. 414.12 Action T-3.1-C: Private Shuttle Services Develop a database of private shuttle services and coordinate with shuttle operators to help reduce the number of single-occupant trips. 414.13 Action T-3.1-D: Transit Ridership Programs Continue to support employer-sponsored transit ridership programs such as the federal Metrocheck program where, pursuant to federal legislation, public and private employers may subsidize employee travel by mass transit each month. 414.14 T-3.2 Curbside Management and Parking 415 Long- or short-term parking is part of almost every car trip, and parking--especially when free--is a key factor in the mode choice for a trip. The availability and price of parking can influence people’s choices about how to travel to work, shop, and conduct personal business. The District’s challenge, like that of many other major cities, is to manage limited curbside space to accommodate ever increasing parking demand. 415.1 There are approximately 400,000 parking spaces in the District of Columbia. The majority of these parking spaces (260,000) are on-street parallel-parking type spaces. About 6 percent of these on- street spaces (16,000) have parking meters. Another 140,000 parking spaces are located off-street in parking lots and garages. The majority of the off-street spaces are located in Downtown parking garages. 415.2 [PULLQUOTE: The availability and price of parking can influence people’s choices about how to travel to work, shop, and conduct personal business.

This group was charged with identifying ways to mitigate parking shortages in the District and to balance competing uses for a limited supply of on- street parking. The taskforce reviewed existing District parking policy and legislation, as well as parking policies of various cities across the county, to develop recommendations to improve parking policy. The key recommendations of the Mayor’s Parking Taskforce Report are highlighted below Guiding principles for parking policy in the District should include: o Prioritizing parking in residential areas for residents o Prioritizing customer parking in commercial areas to promote and facilitate commerce o Introducing demand-based pricing strategies o Ensuring the safety of pedestrians, motorists and parking enforcement personnel o Improving tracking of localized parking demand The residential parking program regulations and enforcement should be based on the type of residential designation. Residential designation is determined by density and proximity to commercial establishments, including Metrorail stations Commercial parking reform should include the introduction of multi-space meters and an adjustment to meter zones and metered parking rates according to market pricing methodologies. This should include improved enforcement, tax incentives to private parking operators, metered loading zones and changes to parking requirements for new construction. [END TEXT BOX] Policy T-3.2.1: Parking Duration in Commercial Areas Encourage the supply and management of public parking in commercial areas to afford priority to customers and others on business errands, and discourage the use of these spaces by all-day parkers, including establishment employees. 415.5 Policy T-3.2.2: Employing Innovations in Parking Consider and implement new technologies to increase the efficiency, management, and ease of use of parking. These include consolidated meters, changeable parking meter fees by time of day or day of the week, shared-use parking, vertical/stacked parking, electronic ticketing of parking offenders and other innovations. 415.6 Action T-3.2-A: Short-Term Parking Continue to work with existing private parking facilities to encourage and provide incentives to convert a portion of the spaces now designated for all-day commuter parking to shorter-term parking. The purpose of this action is to meet the demand for retail, entertainment, and mid-day parking. 415.7 Action T-3.2-B: Car-Share Parking Continue to provide strategically placed and well-defined curbside parking for car-share vehicles, particularly near Metrorail stations, major transit nodes, and major employment destinations, and in medium and high density neighborhoods. 415.8 CITYWIDE ELEMENTS COMPREHENSIVE PLAN DISTRICT ELEMENTS ADOPTED 12/19/06 P. 1-101 Action T-3.2-C: Curbside Management Techniques Revise curbside management and on-street parking policies to a) adjust parking pricing to reflect the demand for and value of curb space (b) adjust the boundaries for residential parking zones (c) establish parking policies that respond to the different parking needs of different types of areas (d) expand the times and days for meter parking enforcement in commercial areas (e) promote management of parking facilities that serve multiple uses (e.g commuters, shoppers, recreation, entertainment, churches, special events, etc f) improve the flexibility and management of parking through mid-block meters, provided that such meters are reasonably spaced and located to accommodate disabled and special needs populations g) preserve, manage, and increase alley space or similar off-street loading space (h) increase enforcement of parking limits, double-parking and other curbside violations, including graduated fines for repeat offenses and towing for violations on key designated arterials. 415.9 112 Action T-3.2-D: Unbundle Parking Cost Find ways to “unbundle” the cost of parking from residential units, allowing those purchasing or renting property to opt out of buying or renting parking spaces. “Unbundling” should be required for Districtowned or subsidized development, and the amount of parking in such development should not exceed that required by Zoning. Further measures to reduce housing costs associated with off-street parking requirements, including waived or reduced parking requirements in the vicinity of Metrorail stations and along major transit corridors, should be pursued during the revision of the Zoning Regulations. These efforts should be coupled with programs to better manage residential street parking in neighborhoods of high parking demand, including adjustments to the costs of residential parking permits. 415.10 T-3.3 Goods Movement 416 Trucks In addition to moving customers and employees to the District’s businesses, the transportation system moves goods to and from many of these same businesses. Trucks constitute about five percent of total vehicle traffic in the District. This is small compared to the 10 to 15 percent of traffic represented by trucks in most major cities in the United States. Truck traffic bound for the District originates primarily in Maryland east of the District. Many trucks enter the District via New York Avenue, where a majority of industrial activity and goods warehousing is concentrated. 416.1 Small trucks such as courier vans and pickup trucks dominate truck traffic in the District. Almost 90 percent of the truck traffic in the downtown area consists of these smaller trucks. The most significant problem with these vehicles is the lack of parking spaces for loading and unloading. Large tractor- trailers constitute approximately 10 percent of truck traffic on the corridors with significant truck traffic. They constitute only about five percent of truck traffic in the downtown area. 416.2 Construction-related truck traffic has become an increasing concern for city residents. Construction vehicles frequently have to travel through residential neighborhoods to get to and from construction sites, creating air pollution, noise, and vibration on these streets. While there are no officially designated truck routes in the city, there are many de facto truck routes because of roadway geometry, traffic conditions, and location relative to trip origins and destinations. Passenger vehicles are also heavy users of these same routes, leading to congestion for both passenger vehicles and trucks. 416.3 In 2004, DDOT prepared a Motor Carrier Management and Threat Assessment Study to address truckrelated concerns, including truck traffic on residential streets, congestion associated with truck loading and unloading, information and services for truck operators, and security issues. Two major CITYWIDE ELEMENTS COMPREHENSIVE PLAN DISTRICT ELEMENTS ADOPTED 12/19/06 P. 1-102 recommendations were made: first, to create a single, exclusive DDOT office to coordinate motor- carrier transactions; and second, to develop a set of designated truck routes. 416.4 [Photo caption: Large tractor trailers constitute approximately 10 percent of the traffic on the corridors with significant truck traffic. They constitute only above five percent of truck traffic in the downtown area.] Freight Rail There are several freight rail lines traversing the city. CSX Transportation operates about 40 trains daily running north and south using the combination of its Capital and Landover lines to get through the 113 District. Other activity on the Landover line includes several coal trains per day. Approximately 30 freight trains per day operate on the Metropolitan line, as well as 20 MARC trains and two Amtrak trains. There are also approximately 30 freight trains per day on the Capital line. 416.5 The Virginia Avenue railroad tunnel provides freight access into the District and is also owned by CSX Transportation. Although there have been proposals to remove this railroad line from freight usage, no plans have been formally adopted to do so. One recent study, the Mid-Atlantic Rail Operations Study (see text box assumes its continued use. The study, which was sponsored by a coalition of five states and three railroads, recommended a public-private program that would expand and upgrade the CSX line. The proposed improvements include reconstructing the Virginia Avenue tunnel and adding railroad capacity by either adding additional tracks and/or increasing the height of the tunnel to allow for double- stacked containers. Such plans need to be carefully coordinated with ongoing plans by the District, as they may not be entirely consistent with the city’s plans to redesign the I-395 freeway and relocate the CSX line. 416.6 [BEGIN SIDEBAR] The Mid-Atlantic Rail Operations Study 416.11 The Mid-Atlantic Rail Operations (MAROP) Study is an initiative of the I-95 Corridor Coalition to examine the deteriorating performance of the Mid-Atlantic’s highway, aviation and rail systems. A consortium of five states and three railroads undertook this study: Delaware, Maryland, New Jersey, Pennsylvania, Virginia, Amtrak, CSX and Norfolk Southern. The study identifies opportunities to improve the region’s existing rail assets, formulates a program of system wide rail investments in all five states; and recommends a public-private partnership to fund and implement the improvements. The study identifies necessary improvements totaling $6.2 billion across these five states over the next 20 years to relieve various choke points, requiring a cooperative effort among all levels of government and the railroads to plan, finance and deliver projects that alleviate rail system choke points.

Policy T-3.3.4: Truck Management Manage truck circulation in the city to avoid negative impacts on residential streets and reduce the volume of truck traffic on major commute routes during peak travel hours. Action T-3.3-A: New Office for Trucking and Goods Movement Create a single, exclusive office within the Department of Transportation to coordinate motor vehicle transactions, as well as coordination with trucking companies and other stakeholders. This office should 114 also work with other District agencies, to enhance curbside management policies and ensure that delivery regulations serve the needs of customers and the general public. 416.9 Action T-3.3-B: Tiered Truck Route System Develop a tiered truck route system to serve the delivery and movement of goods while protecting residential areas and other sensitive land uses. 416.10 T-3.4 Traveler Information 417 Traveler information plays a key role in transportation system efficiency, and new technologies provide an increasing number of options for providing timely information to travelers across all modes. A stateof- the-art traveler information system can enhance transportation quality, safety, cost-effectiveness, and efficiency. 417.1 For visitors, wayfinding signage—that is, signage that helps travelers reach their destinations—is one of the most important components of the District’s transportation infrastructure. Much of the existing wayfinding signing in the District is effective and appropriate for motorists, but gaps exist in the network of signs. High quality and carefully-designed wayfinding signs for pedestrians can also help orient tourists, Metro riders, and others so they can easily find their intended destinations. 417.2 [Photo Caption: High quality and carefully designed wayfinding signs can help orient tourists, Metro riders, and others so they can easily find their intended destinations.] Policy T-3.4.1: Traveler Information Systems Promote user-friendly, accurate, and timely traveler information systems for highways and transit such as variable message signs, Global Positioning System (GPS) traffic information, and real-time bus arrival information, to improve traffic flow and customer satisfaction. 417.3 Action T-3.4-A: Transit Directional Signs Establish a joint city/WMATA/ private sector Task Force to improve and augment pedestrian directional signs and system maps for transit riders, especially at Metro station exits, and at various locations in Central Washington. 417.4 Action T-3.4-B: Regional Efforts Through a regionally coordinated effort, continue to explore and implement travel information options such as the provision of printed and electronic maps and Internet-based information to tour bus operators, travel agents, and trucking companies. 417.5 CITYWIDE ELEMENTS COMPREHENSIVE PLAN DISTRICT ELEMENTS ADOPTED 12/19/06 P. 1-104 T-3.5 Tour Bus Operations 418 As a major tourist destination, the District is host to over 100,000 tour buses every year, an average of almost 300 per day. Currently, only a limited number of areas are available for tour buses to load and unload passengers or park, and buses are restricted to a three minute idling time limit, which includes loading/unloading passengers. These conditions and regulations create difficulties for tour bus operators. As a result, tour buses tend to stop or park on neighborhood streets and circle the blocks near the tourist loading areas to avoid exceeding the limits on idling times. Many tour bus operators remain in the District only long enough to take tourists to major attractions and then leave, resulting in loss of revenues as tourists shop, dine and spend the night in suburban jurisdictions. There is a need to identify clearly defined parking areas and loading zones for tour buses. 418.1 Policy T-3.5.1: Tour Bus Facilities Develop carefully-planned parking areas, loading zones, and dedicated routes for tour buses to 115 prevent tour bus parking in residential neighborhoods. Enforce and apply fines and penalties when tour bus parking and route regulations are violated. 418.2 Action T-3.5.A: Tour Bus Management Initiative Implement the recommendations of the DDOT Tour Bus Management Initiative, prepared to ameliorate long-standing problems associated with tour bus parking, roaming, and idling around the city’s major visitor attractions. 418.3 T-4 Safety and Security 419 Transportation has always played an important role in Washington’s security by providing a means of evacuation as well as routes for emergency and relief services. The city must continue to plan for and safeguard its transportation system, protecting its value as a major component of our urban infrastructure and economy. 419.1 T-4.1 Emergency Preparedness, Transportation, and Security 420 In light of the events of September 11, 2001, every major American city has embarked on emergency preparedness and traveler information systems designed to inform citizens how to respond in the event of an emergency. As the Nation’s Capital, this is a critically important issue for the District. 420.1 Should the District face an emergency situation, the transportation system provides the critical means to evacuate residents, workers and visitors, as well as support the movement of emergency service response teams. Depending on the nature of an incident, persons may need to rely on car, train, bus, bike, and/or walking. Maintaining and planning for a well-functioning, coordinated system that can adapt to the needs of an incident is essential. Given the District’s reliance on the regional transportation network in the event of an evacuation, close coordination with partners in Maryland and Virginia is also needed. 420.2 [PULLQUOTE: Should the District face an emergency situation, the transportation system provides the critical means to evacuate residents, workers and visitors, as well as support the movement of emergency service response teams. Depending on the nature of an incident, persons may need to rely on car, train, bus, bike, and/or walking.] The District’s Department of Transportation is the lead District agency for all regional and federal emergency transportation coordination and activities that affect the District. Another key agency is the CITYWIDE ELEMENTS COMPREHENSIVE PLAN DISTRICT ELEMENTS ADOPTED 12/19/06 P. 1-105 District’s Emergency Management Agency (DCEMA which partners with District agencies, businesses and communities to help plan for management of an emergency event. There is also increasing coordination between regional departments of transportation, the federal government, and other agencies, primarily through the Metropolitan Washington Council of Governments. 420.3 The region has identified 25 corridors radiating from downtown Washington as emergency event/evacuation routes. Each of the routes extends to the Capital Beltway (I-495) and beyond. Customized roadway signs allow for easy identification of direction; outbound signs direct motorists to I- 495 in Maryland and Virginia, and inbound signs show images of monuments. Evacuation routes are also identified by street name signs, which include the red and white District flag. 420.4 If directions are given to evacuate the central business district, Pennsylvania Avenue, NW, between Rock 116 Creek Park and the US Capitol serves as the dividing line for routes. None of the evacuation routes cross each other, and no vehicles would be permitted to cross Pennsylvania Avenue. Traffic signals would be timed to move traffic away from the incident area. In addition, police officers would be present at 70 critical intersections on the evacuation routes within the District to expedite the flow of traffic and prevent bottlenecks. There are also six bike trails identified that could be used by cyclists or pedestrians in the event of an evacuation. 420.5 DCEMA has produced several sets of plans relating to emergency preparedness. Its Emergency Response Plan includes a transportation section, which details District policies, actions and responsibilities related to traffic management, the coordination of transportation logistics, and the status and/or restoration of the transportation infrastructure. In addition, DCEMA drafted 39 Community Emergency Preparedness Plans for neighborhood clusters throughout the District to help residents prepare for emergencies. However, these plans do not contain cluster-specific information regarding neighborhood evacuation routes, modes of travel and other transportation-related issues. 420.6 Although the District is more equipped now than it has been in the past, additional planning is needed in order to better prepare the region’s transportation network and emergency management agencies. Not only should the District continue to plan for evacuations at the local level and provide the necessary information to the public, it must also improve coordination with its regional partners and take advantage of new technologies, as well as federal support, in preparing for emergencies. 420.7 [PULLQUOTE: Not only should the District continue to plan for evacuations at the local level and provide the necessary information to the public, it must also improve coordination with its regional partners and take advantage of new technologies, as well as federal support, in preparing for emergencies.] As home to the largest concentration of federal agencies and facilities in the country, the District and the federal governments must continue to coordinate extensively to ensure the District’s security and mobility needs. Over the past decade, several of the District’s streets have been closed by the federal government to protect the White House and the US Capitol Building. These street closures have disrupted mobility for pedestrians and vehicles, requiring extensive re-routing of Metrobus and vehicular travel through downtown and Capitol Hill. This has led to delays for residents, workers, tourists, and emergency service providers. 420.8 Please refer to the Community Services and Facilities Element for additional policies and actions related to Emergency Preparedness and the Urban Design Element for policies on Security and Design. CITYWIDE ELEMENTS COMPREHENSIVE PLAN DISTRICT ELEMENTS ADOPTED 12/19/06 P. 1-106 Policy T-4.1.1: Balancing Security Measures and Desires for an Open City. Balance and mitigate security requirements against the daily mobility, efficiency, and quality of life concerns of District residents and visitors, and the potential for negative economic, environmental, and historic impacts. The trade-offs associated with potential street closures or changes to transportation access must be adequately assessed. 420.9 Policy T-4.1.2: Coordination with the Federal Government 117 Work closely with federal agencies to find alternative security solutions and to avoid street closings to the greatest possible extent. 420.10 Policy T-4.1.3: Providing Redundancies Provide alternate routes and modes of travel (“redundancies”) across the District to promote the security of District residents and visitors and reduce the effects on non-routine incidents. 420.11 Action T-4.1-A: Pennsylvania Avenue Closure Advocate for the re-opening of Pennsylvania Avenue and E Street in the vicinity of the White House as conditions allow, and pursue federal funding to mitigate the effects of the closure of these streets on District circulation. 420.12 Action T-4.1-B: Coordination with the Federal Government Continue to work with the Federal government to assess the impacts of security measures on the quality of life of District residents and businesses. 420.13 Action T-4.1-C: Emergency Evacuation Plan Continue to refine an emergency evacuation plan that describes not only evacuation procedures and routes, but that also defines the modes of transportation in case certain modes, such as the Metrorail system, become unavailable. Increase public education and awareness of local emergency management plans, and make information on evacuation routes and procedures more accessible and understandable to residents, employees, and visitors. 420.14 CITYWIDE ELEMENTS COMPREHENSIVE PLAN DISTRICT ELEMENTS ADOPTED 12/19/06 P. 1-107 CHAPTER 5 HOUSING Overview 500 The Housing Element of the Comprehensive Plan describes the importance of housing to neighborhood quality in the District of Columbia and the importance of providing housing opportunities for all segments of our population. 500.1 The critical housing issues facing the District of Columbia are addressed in this Element. These include Ensuring housing affordability Fostering housing production Conserving existing housing stock Promoting home ownership Providing housing for residents with special needs These issues affect every facet of the Comprehensive Plan. They influence land use and density decisions, shape infrastructure and community service needs, determine transportation demand, and even drive employment strategies for District residents. At the most basic level, it is the availability of safe, decent, affordable housing that will determine whether the District’s vision for an inclusive city will be realized. The type of housing constructed and the cost of that housing will influence whether we as a city can attract families with children, maintain neighborhood diversity, and provide economic opportunity for all. 500.2 The city’s housing stock is varied in type and size. Table 5.1 shows the number of units by type, year built, size, and vacancy rate. Of the city’s 248,000 occupied housing units in 2000, 41 percent were owner-occupied and 59 percent were renter-occupied. Forty percent of the housing units in the city are 118 single-family units and over 35 percent of the housing stock was built before 1940. 500.3 In the eight years since the Comprehensive Plan was last amended, there has been a tremendous increase in housing demand, driven by demographic shifts, low interest rates, regional economic growth, falling crime rates, renewed confidence in District government, and improvements in public services. The increase in demand has propelled a steep upward spiral in housing costs, impacting renters and homeowners alike. 500.4 The increase in demand has also resulted in a tremendous increase in the production of housing. There were more than 2,200 new units permitted in 2005, 75 percent above the 2001-2003 average and more than eight times the average of the 1990s. In late 2005, an astonishing 8,900 housing units were under construction or about to break ground in the city—the biggest building boom in Washington since the early 1960s. Table 5.2 shows the recent trends in housing units permitted. 500.5 Even more dramatic has been the increase in housing values. Between 2000 and 2005, the median sales price for a single-family home in the District rose 174 percent, from $178,250 to $489,000. Condominiums and cooperatives — once considered “starter” homes for first time buyers — have increased equally, from a median sales price of $138,000 in 2000 to $377,950 in 2005. Rents have also soared, jumping 12 percent between 2003 and 2004 alone. As prices have risen, the percentage of residents able to comfortably afford the median priced home or apartment has dropped. In 2001, 34 percent of the District’s for-sale housing would have been affordable to a family supported by a full- time school teacher. By 2004, that figure had dropped to just 16 percent. The tightening availability of CITYWIDE ELEMENTS COMPREHENSIVE PLAN DISTRICT ELEMENTS ADOPTED 12/19/06 P. 1-108 workforce housing is hindering the District’s ability to retain and attract moderate income households. Figure 5.1 shows housing value change from 1990 to 2005. 500.6 [INSERT Figure 5.1: Annual Percent Change in DC Housing Values, 1990 – 2005 500.7] Table 5.1: District’s Housing Stock, 2000 500.8 Total Housing Units 274,845 Occupied Housing Units 248,338 Owner-Occupied 41% Renter-Occupied 59% Homeowner Vacancy (2004) 2.4% Rental Vacancy (2004) 11.3% Type Single-family detached 13% Row houses 27% 2-4 units 11% 5+ units 49% Housing Units by Year of Construction 1995-2000 3% 1980-1989 5% 1960-1979 24% 1940-1959 34% 1939 or earlier 35% Source: US Census and Fannie Mae Table 5.2: New Privately Owned Housing Units Authorized 500.9 Time Period Units 1990s (Average Annual) 251 2000 (actual) 924 2001 (actual) 896 2002 (actual) 1,591 2003 (actual) 1,427 2004 (actual) 1,595 2005 (actual) 2,860 Source: DC Office of Planning CITYWIDE ELEMENTS 119 COMPREHENSIVE PLAN DISTRICT ELEMENTS ADOPTED 12/19/06 P. 1-109 The rising costs have triggered a crisis of affordability, particularly for the District’s lowest income residents. Residents must set aside a growing share of their earnings for housing, leaving less disposable income for health care, transportation, food, and other basic needs. The market has also become more segmented, with dwindling housing choices for working families and the middle class in general. “Move up” options for lower income households have become limited, and the opportunity for many residents to build individual wealth through home ownership has become more difficult. 500.10 For existing residents who are already homeowners, the price surge has been a source of wealth as their homes have appreciated in value. The strength of the housing market has also created opportunities to solve some of the very problems it is creating. The recent boom has raised real estate values, incomes, and sales, generating millions of dollars in new revenues for housing programs. The pending availability of several large sites for redevelopment creates housing construction opportunities that did not exist five or ten years ago. New inclusionary zoning legislation will soon require affordable units to be included in many market-rate projects. 500.11 The housing shortfall will continue to create a market dynamic where housing costs increase faster than incomes. Consistent multi-jurisdictional efforts are needed to increase the supply of housing to better meet demand. Intergovernmental agreements and initiatives also will be needed to ensure that all jurisdictions bear their fair share of the region’s housing needs and do not leave that responsibility solely to the District of Columbia. 500.12 On a neighborhood level, the recent housing boom has challenged the District’s ability to grow a city of inclusive and racially and economically diverse communities. The District has been relatively successful in developing new affordable housing, building or rehabilitating 17,700 affordable units in the last six years alone. However, most of this production has occurred in the very neighborhoods where such housing was already concentrated. 500.13 Map 5.1 illustrates the location of affordable housing projects developed since 2000, overlaid on a map that characterizes neighborhoods as “stable”, “emerging”, “transitioning”, or “distressed” based on demographic and market factors. With the exception of a few projects, there has been very little new affordable housing built in Stable and Transitioning neighborhoods. The map also shows that recent market rate housing has been built almost entirely in Stable and Transitioning neighborhoods. If left unchecked, these patterns will continue to concentrate lower income residents in some neighborhoods and find them scarce in others. 500.14 While the market for housing has been robust during the last five years, there is no guarantee this will continue indefinitely. The first six months of 2006 suggest softer demand due to high prices and rising interest rates. Measures to increase affordable housing must be mindful of market dynamics and the burden placed on the private sector so that forward momentum can be sustained. This may require additional bold steps by District government, such as the recent increase in the deed recordation and transfer taxes. 500.15 [SIDEBAR: The Washington Metropolitan area is projected to add 1.4 million jobs between 2005 and 2030. Using the existing regional ratio of 1.63 jobs per household, the Metropolitan Washington 120 Council of Governments has estimated that these jobs will translate into a need for 860,000 housing units in the next 25 years.] [INSERT Map 5.1: 2000-2005 Housing Development by Neighborhood Typology 500.16] One of the critical issues facing the city is how to retain and create more housing units that are large enough for families with children. As a percent of total households in the District, 21 percent are CITYWIDE ELEMENTS COMPREHENSIVE PLAN DISTRICT ELEMENTS ADOPTED 12/19/06 P. 1-110 comprised of families with children. This percentage has been stable over several decades and is substantially lower than the 33 percent rate for both the region and the nation. Other cities such as San Francisco and Boston have similar rates to the District. New York’s rate is 30 percent, which is closer to the national average. 500.17 Family households with children need larger housing units with more bedrooms. Of the city’s existing housing stock, only one-third of the units have three bedrooms or more. Eighty percent of recent new construction has been apartments, with fewer bedrooms. 500.18 Between 2000 and 2004, the city’s vital records show an increase in population in the 0-4, 20-34, 55- 69, and the 80 or more years age groupings. The increase in the youngest grouping is a positive sign that families in the city are having children. Retaining these new families and the city’s existing families is important to the health of the city. 500.19 [PULLQUOTE: The increase in the youngest grouping is a positive sign that families in the city are having children. Retaining these new families and the city’s existing families is important to the vibrancy and health of the city.] The availability of single-family housing and housing with more rooms are two factors that are positively correlated with retaining family households. Of course, there are many other factors that are important including affordability, crime, and school quality. 500.20 Who is moving in and out of the District? According to Fannie Mae’s Housing in the National’s Capital, one in five (113,000) of the District’s 2000 population had moved into the city since 1995. Out- movers during this same period numbered 158,000. In-movers were less likely to be families with children than out-movers (25% versus 45 less likely to be black, more likely to be poor, and also more likely to be homeowners than out-movers during the same period.

It is 121 organized into four major sections. The first addresses housing production, including both market-rate and affordable housing. The second addresses housing conservation, focusing particularly on antidisplacement strategies and housing maintenance. The third section addresses home ownership and fair housing laws. The final section covers the special needs of the homeless, persons with disabilities, seniors, and others who are not adequately served by the private market. 500.23 CITYWIDE ELEMENTS COMPREHENSIVE PLAN DISTRICT ELEMENTS ADOPTED 12/19/06 P. 1-111 Housing Goal 501 The overarching goal for housing is as follows: Develop and maintain a safe, decent, and affordable supply of housing for all current and future residents of the District of Columbia.501.1 [PULLQUOTE: Housing Goal: The overarching goal for housing is as follows: Develop and maintain a safe, decent, and affordable supply of housing for all current and future residents of the District of Columbia.] Policies and Actions H-1.0 Homes for an Inclusive City 502 This section of the Housing Element addresses housing production, both for market rate and affordable units. 502.1 The District must increase its rate of housing production if it is to meet current and projected needs through 2025 and remain an economically vibrant city. Over the next 20 years, the District’s housing stock is forecast to increase from a base of about 280,000 in 2005 to 335,000 units in 2025. Between 2005 and 2010, 10,000 new units are expected, based on projects that are now under construction or soon to break ground. The remaining new units — 45,000 in total — will be needed by 2025 to improve the long-term balance between demand and supply. This is equivalent to 3,000 new units per year. This is significantly higher than the rate of production experienced during 2000-2005. However, the city permitted 2,860 units in 2005, indicating this target is not out of reach. 502.2 As noted in the Land Use and Framework Elements, the city already has the land resources to meet this demand. But land alone is not enough to ensure the production of housing. And housing production alone does not guarantee that a portion of the new units will be affordable. 502.3 A multi-pronged strategy is needed to facilitate production, address regulatory and administrative constraints, and ensure that a substantial number of the new units added are affordable to District residents. Many of the basic tenets of this strategy were established by the 2006 Comprehensive Housing Strategy and are reiterated in the text box on the following page. 502.4 [BEGIN SIDEBAR] The Comprehensive Housing Strategy 502.5 In 2003, the Council of the District of Columbia passed the “Comprehensive Housing Strategy Act,” creating a Task Force charged with developing recommendations on the housing needs of current and future residents of the District. The 28-member Task Force, was specifically asked to explore strategies for preserving and creating mixed income neighborhoods; assessing the quality, availability, and affordability of rental housing; creating home ownership opportunities; preventing displacement; assessing special needs housing; promoting workforce housing; and increasing the District’s population by 100,000 residents. 122 CITYWIDE ELEMENTS COMPREHENSIVE PLAN DISTRICT ELEMENTS ADOPTED 12/19/06 P. 1-112 The 2006 Task Force report presents seven basic recommendations for improving housing affordability and growing the population. Foremost among these is the production of 55,000 new housing units, including 19,000 affordable units, and the preservation of at least 30,000 existing affordable units. The report includes strategies to increase the home ownership rate, provide direct assistance to 14,600 low income renter households, and include affordable housing in the “new neighborhoods” to be developed during the next 15 years. The report emphasizes the need to build the city’s administrative capacity for housing production, and to enact complementary programs to improve neighborhood services to attract and retain residents. The cost of these recommendations is estimated at $300 million per year over 15 years. Many of the strategies in the Housing Strategy have been carried forward into this Housing Element. This is an important step toward their implementation, and will move the city one step closer to achieving its housing goals. [END SIDEBAR] H-1.1 Expanding Housing Supply 503 Expanding the housing supply is a key part of the District’s vision to create successful neighborhoods. Along with improved transportation and shopping, better neighborhood schools and parks, preservation of historic resources, and improved design and identity, the production of housing is essential to the future of our neighborhoods. It is also a key to improving the city’s fiscal health. The District will work to facilitate housing construction and rehabilitation through its planning, building, and housing programs, recognizing and responding to the needs of all segments of the community. The first step toward meeting this goal is to ensure that an adequate supply of appropriately zoned land is available to meet expected housing needs. 503.1 Policy H-1.1.1: Private Sector Support Encourage the private sector to provide new housing to meet the needs of present and future District residents at locations consistent with District land use policies and objectives. 503.2 Policy H-1.1.2: Production Incentives Provide suitable regulatory, tax, and financing incentives to meet housing production goals. These incentives should continue to include zoning regulations that permit greater building area for commercial projects that include housing than for commercial projects that do not include housing. 503.3 Policy H-1.1.3: Balanced Growth Strongly encourage the development of new housing on surplus, vacant and underutilized land in all parts of the city. Ensure that a sufficient supply of land is planned and zoned to enable the city to meet its long-term housing needs, including the need for low- and moderate-density single family homes as well as the need for higher-density housing. 503.4 Policy H-1.1.4: Mixed Use Development Promote mixed use development, including housing, on commercially zoned land, particularly in neighborhood commercial centers, along Main Street mixed use corridors, and around appropriate Metrorail stations. 503.5 123 Policy H-1.1.5: Housing Quality Require the design of affordable housing to meet the same high-quality architectural standards required of market-rate housing. Regardless of its affordability level, new or renovated housing should be CITYWIDE ELEMENTS COMPREHENSIVE PLAN DISTRICT ELEMENTS ADOPTED 12/19/06 P. 1-113 indistinguishable from market rate housing in its exterior appearance and should address the need for open space and recreational amenities, and respect the design integrity of adjacent properties and the surrounding neighborhood. 503.6 Policy H-1.1.6: Housing in the Central City Absorb a substantial component of the demand for new high-density housing in Central Washington and along the Anacostia River. Absorbing the demand for higher density units within these areas is an effective way to meet housing demands, create mixed-use areas, and conserve single-family residential neighborhoods throughout the city. Mixed income, higher density downtown housing also provides the opportunity to create vibrant street life, and to support the restaurants, retail, entertainment, and other amenities that are desired and needed in the heart of the city. 503.7 See the Land Use, Urban Design, and Area Elements for related policies. Policy H-1.1.7: New Neighborhoods Accommodate a significant share of the District’s projected housing demand in “new neighborhoods” developed on large sites formerly used for government functions. In addition to housing, these neighborhoods must include well-planned retail, public schools, attractive parks, open space and recreation, as well as needed supportive services. The new neighborhoods should include a variety of housing types, serving a variety of income levels. 503.8 See also the Land Use Element policies on transit oriented development and mixed use. Action H-1.1-A: Rezoning of Marginal Commercial Land Perform an evaluation of commercially zoned land in the District, focusing on the “Great Streets” corridors, other arterial streets, and scattered small commercially-zoned pockets of land which no longer contain active commercial land uses. The evaluation should consider the feasibility of rezoning some of these areas from commercial to residential districts, in order to ensure their future development with housing. 503.9 Action H-1.1-B: Annual Housing Reports and Monitoring Efforts Consider development of an Annual “State of DC Housing Report” which improves the quality of information on which to make housing policy decisions and/or a Housing Oversight Board comprised of residents, for-profit, and non-profit developers that reports each year on the effectiveness and outcomes of the District’s housing programs. 503.10 H-1.2 Ensuring Housing Affordability 504 The District of Columbia faces numerous affordable housing challenges. It has both a disproportionate share of the region’s poorest residents and the region’s most rapid decline in the availability of housing to serve these residents. In 2005, the median income for a family of four for the region was $89,300, but it was just $55,750 in the District. In fact, about three-quarters of the city’s households earn below the regional median income, while at the same time housing prices in the city are increasing at a faster rate than almost any jurisdiction in the metropolitan area. The share of District renters who paid more than 30 percent of their incomes for housing jumped from 39 percent in 2000 to 46 percent in 2004. The share paying more than 50 percent of their incomes climbed from 18 percent to 23 percent. 504.1 124 Prices have risen everywhere, but have gone up most rapidly in the older neighborhoods to the north and east of downtown. Parts of Capitol Hill, Shaw, Columbia Heights, and Eckington experienced annualized sales price increases of over 20 percent a year between 1999 and 2004. Even neighborhoods east of the Anacostia River experienced double-digit inflation during this time period. Price increases in the affluent CITYWIDE ELEMENTS COMPREHENSIVE PLAN DISTRICT ELEMENTS ADOPTED 12/19/06 P. 1-114 neighborhoods west of Rock Creek were less dramatic but were already out of reach for most District residents even before 2000. 504.2 Economic forecasts suggest that many of the jobs that will be created in the District during the next 20 years will not provide the compensation needed to pay for housing in the city. For example, the District’s fast-growing office support, sales, and service sector pays an average annual wage of $36,000. For a single wage-earner, this provides barely enough income to rent a one-bedroom apartment, much less to purchase a condominium or single family home. Even a two-income household with such salaries would be unable to afford market-rate home ownership. As the gap widens, there may be a number of consequences. Residents may work unreasonably long hours or multiple jobs; they may double up in overcrowded apartments and houses; live in unsafe or substandard housing; or give up living in the District altogether, choosing instead to endure long commutes into the city each day. 504.3 The District has been working to protect the affordability of existing housing opportunities for lower income residents and to ensure that a substantial share of the housing built in the next 20 years is affordable to District residents. Between 1999 and 2005, the District’s housing agencies expended over $1 billion in gross public subsidies on construction and renovation. An array of financial and regulatory tools and programs already are in place, some linked to federal housing programs, some created by District government, and others originating through partnerships with the private and non-profit sectors (see Table 5.4 for a list of the major housing programs in the District 504.4 Table 5.4: Major Housing Programs in the District 504.5 Apartment Improvement Program Construction Assistance Program Community Land Acquisition Program Distressed Properties Improvement Program Housing Finance for Elderly, Dependent, and Disabled Housing Production Trust Fund Program Department of Housing and Community Development (DHCD) a Low Income Housing Tax Credit Program Housing Development Program District of Columbia Housing Finance Agency (DCHFA)b Homeownership Program Housing Choice Voucher Program (HCVP) HOPE VI Program District of Columbia Housing Authority (DCHA)c Public Housing Home Again Initiative Deputy Mayor for Planning and Economic Development (DMPED)d New Communities District of Columbia Office of Planning (OP) Inclusionary Housing Rent Control DC Council Tax Abatement for Downtown Housing a For more information on DHCD programs please see http dhcd.dc.gov/dhcd b For more information on DCHFA programs please see http www.dchfa.org c For more information on DCHA programs please see http www.dchousing.org d For more information on DMPED programs please see http dcbiz.dc.gov/dmped 125 The District also has been pursuing regulatory measures that require affordable housing in new development. For many years, the city has had a policy requiring developers seeking commercial density bonuses to provide affordable housing or pay into the Housing Production Trust Fund. In addition, a pending inclusionary zoning ordinance would require affordable units within future market-rate residential development of 10 units or greater. The foundation for these actions was created by the previous Comprehensive Plan and is carried forward in this Element. 504.6 CITYWIDE ELEMENTS COMPREHENSIVE PLAN DISTRICT ELEMENTS ADOPTED 12/19/06 P. 1-115 [BEGIN TEXT BOX] What is Affordable Housing? 504.7 One of the most common requests made during Comprehensive Plan public meetings was to provide a clear definition of “affordable” housing. Affordable housing is defined as housing in which occupancy is limited to households meeting special income guidelines. The price of this housing is maintained at a level below what the free market would demand using restrictive deeds, covenants, mortgage subsidies, vouchers, or other means tied to public financing or tax credits. Generally, the cost of affordable housing is limited to 30% of a household’s income (which varies according to the number of people in the household different affordable housing programs are “benchmarked”, or targeted, to specific income groups as defined by the US Department of Housing and Urban Development. The benchmarked incomes for the Washington Metropolitan Area in 2005 are shown in the table below. The list includes the major housing assistance programs that serve households in each group. In 2005, the areawide median income (AMI for a family of four was $89,300. The terms “extremely low”, “very low”, “low”, and “moderate” income correspond to up to 30 50 80 and 120% of that amount, respectively. Example: If a single mother earned $7 per hour, her annual income would be $14,560 and fall within the “extremely low income” category. If she spends 30% of her income on housing, she could afford to pay only $364 per month on housing. Finding decent housing or any housing at this price range is a challenge in Washington. Target Family of HUD Income “Affordable” Monthly Income 4 Income Group Housing Cost Programs 30% AMI $26,790 Ext. Low $670 DC Housing Authority 50% AMI $44,650 Very Low $1116 Housing Prod.Trust Fund (HPTF) 60% AMI $53,580 $1339 Low Income Housing Tax Credit 65% AMI $58,000 $1450 CDBG, HOME 80% AMI $71,440 Low $1776 HPTF, Inclusionary Zoning 95% AMI $84,835 $2120 Home Purchase Assist. Program 120% AMI $107,160 Moderate $2679 Historic Home Investment Tax Credit (proposed) By contrast, “market rate” housing is defined as housing with rents or sales prices that are allowed to change with market conditions, including increased demand. Some market rate housing may be affordable to moderate and some low income households. Rent-controlled apartments are counted as “market rate” units because there are no occupancy restrictions. The District’s rent control law stipulates that rents on market rate apartments built prior to 1975 may rise only as fast as the Consumer 126 Price Index (CPI Regional Areawide Median Income (AMI) is used rather than DC’s median income because it is the federal government benchmark com monly used to qualify for funding subsidies. [END TEXTBOX] CITYWIDE ELEMENTS COMPREHENSIVE PLAN DISTRICT ELEMENTS ADOPTED 12/19/06 P. 1-116 Policy H-1.2.1: Affordable Housing Production as a Civic Priority Establish the production of housing for low and moderate income households as a major civic priority, to be supported through public programs that stimulate affordable housing production and rehabilitation throughout the city. 504.8 Policy H-1.2.2: Production Targets Consistent with the Comprehensive Housing Strategy, work toward a goal that one-third of the new housing built in the city over the next 20 years should be affordable to persons earning 80 percent or less of the areawide median income (AMI Newly produced affordable units should be targeted towards lowincome households in proportions roughly equivalent to the proportions shown in Figure 5.2. 504.9 Policy H-1.2.3: Mixed Income Housing Focus investment strategies and affordable housing programs to distribute mixed income housing more equitably across the entire city, taking steps to avoid further concentration of poverty within areas of the city that already have substantial affordable housing. 504.10 Policy H-1.2.4: Housing Affordability on Publicly Owned Sites Require that a substantial percentage of the housing units built on publicly owned sites, including sites being transferred from federal to District jurisdiction, are reserved for low and moderate income households. 504.11 Policy H-1.2.5: Workforce Housing In addition to programs targeting persons of very low and extremely low incomes, develop and implement programs that meet the housing needs of teachers, fire fighters, police officers, nurses, city workers, and others in the public service professions with wages insufficient to afford market-rate housing in the city. 504.12 Policy H-1.2.6: Non-Profit Involvement Actively involve and coordinate with the non-profit development sector, increasing their capacity to produce affordable housing. Enter into partnerships with the non-profit sector so that public funding can be used to leverage the creation of affordable units. 504.13 Policy H-1.2.7: Density Bonuses for Affordable Housing Provide zoning incentives to developers proposing to build low- and moderate-income housing. Affordable housing shall be considered a public benefit for the purposes of granting density bonuses when new development is proposed. Density bonuses should be granted in historic districts only when the effect of such increased density does not significantly undermine the character of the neighborhood. 504.14 Policy H-1.2.8: DC Housing Finance Agency Support the activities of the District’s Housing Finance Agency to finance new construction and rehabilitation of affordable rental and owner units, including vacant and abandoned units. 504.15 Action H-1.2-A: Inclusionary Zoning Adopt an Inclusionary Zoning requirement which would require the inclusion of affordable units for low income households in new residential developments of 10 units or greater, with accompanying provisions for density bonuses and long-term affordability. Apply this requirement as fairly and uniformly as possible, providing flexibility as necessary for sites where density bonuses cannot feasibly be 127 provided. 504.16 CITYWIDE ELEMENTS COMPREHENSIVE PLAN DISTRICT ELEMENTS ADOPTED 12/19/06 P. 1-117 [INSERT Figure 5.2:Targeted Distribution of New Affordable Units by Income Group (AMI=Areawide Median Income) 504.17] [CAPTION BELOW GRAPHIC: The 2006 Comprehensive Housing Strategy recommended that one- third of the units produced in the city in the next 15 years be targeted to persons earning 80% of the AMI or below. The lower pie chart shows the proposed allocation of these units to low, very low, and extremely low income groups.] [BEGIN TEXTBOX] The District’s Commercial Linkage Requirement 504.18 In 1994, the District of Columbia adopted zoning provisions that linked the granting of bonus density in commercial development projects to requirements for affordable housing. The “linkage” recognized that the demand for housing in the city was driven in part by new commercial development and rising land values. The linkage provisions are currently triggered by The approval of a “discretionary and otherwise appropriate street or alley closing which results in the provision of additional commercial office space” by the Council The approval of a “discretionary and otherwise appropriate zoning density increase which results in the provision of additional office space” by the Zoning Commission In such cases, applicants are required to construct or rehabilitate housing that remains affordable to low and moderate income households for at least 20 years, or to pay into the District’s Housing Production Trust Fund. If the applicant agrees to construct or rehabilitate affordable housing, the square footage of housing that must be built varies from 25 to 50 percent of the density “bonus” being granted, depending on if the housing is provided on-site or off-site. Applicants can use any of a number of tools to build the housing, such as partnerships and joint ventures. If the applicant agrees to pay into the Housing Production Trust Fund, the payment must equal at least half of the assessed value of the square footage of the density “bonus” being granted. Additional provisions relating to the timing of the improvements apply. The linkage requirements include a number of exemptions, such as projects that are already subject to housing, retail, arts, or historic preservation requirements, projects approved prior to 1994, and projects receiving density bonuses through variances. The Zoning Commission also has the authority to grant exemptions from this requirement based on certain findings relating to Comprehensive Plan consistency. [END TEXT BOX] Action H-1.2-B Commercial Linkage Assessment Prepare an assessment of the District’s existing commercial linkage requirements to determine the effectiveness of this program and assess its impacts, advantages, and disadvantages. Based on findings, adjust the linkage requirements as needed. 504.19 Action H-1.2-C: New Revenue Sources Identify and tap new sources of revenue for the Housing Production Trust Fund (HPTF) to produce affordable housing and keep rental and owned housing affordable. These new sources could include 128 increases in the portion of the deed recordation tax dedicated to the HPTF, increases in the recordation tax, or earmarking of a portion of residential property tax revenue increases to the Fund. 504.20 CITYWIDE ELEMENTS COMPREHENSIVE PLAN DISTRICT ELEMENTS ADOPTED 12/19/06 P. 1-118 Action H-1.2-D: Land Banking Develop a strategic land acquisition program to purchase land in the District to achieve specific housing and neighborhood goals, particularly for the District’s three major development entities: the National Capital Revitalization Corporation, the Anacostia Waterfront Corporation, and the DC Housing Authority. 504.21 Action H-1.2-E: LAHDO Program Continue the District’s Land Acquisition for Housing Development Opportunities (LAHDO) program, which acquires property (using primarily District capital budget funds) and provides for long-term leaseback or low cost terms to private developers that produce low- and moderate-income rental housing. 504.22 Action H-1.2-F: Low Income Housing Tax Credits Expand for-profit builders’ use of Low Income Housing Tax Credits as one tool to provide new or rehabilitated affordable housing in the city. 504.23 Action H-1.2-G: Land Trusts Support the formation of one or more community land trusts run by public, non-profit, or other community-based entities. The mission of the trust would be to acquire land while providing long- term leases to developers of rental and for-sale units. This approach helps ensure that the units remain affordable indefinitely. 504.24 Action H-1.2-H: Hotel Conversions Evaluate the feasibility of requiring an affordable housing set-aside in the event that transient hotels are converted to permanent housing units. 504.25 [SIDEBAR: “Being a single mom with two children in college, two in high school, and one in junior high, I am fighting, hoping, and praying that the affordable housing will remain throughout the city.”— DC resident at Comprehensive Plan public workshop] H-1.3 Diversity of Housing Type 505 The existing housing stock in the District of Columbia is varied in size and type. As Figure 5.3 shows, about 44 percent of the city’s housing units consist of studios and one bedroom units. Units with four or more bedrooms comprise just 11 percent of the total units. 505.1 During the last five years, more than 80 percent of the new housing in the city has consisted of multifamily housing. As this trend continues, the District faces the prospect of a less diverse housing stock, with a growing share of one- and two-bedroom multi-family units and a declining share of housing large enough for families with children. In addition to the newly built housing, the conversion of single family row houses into multi-unit flats may be further eroding the supply of three and four bedroom units in the city. 505.2 [INSERT Figure 5.3: Distribution of Housing by Number of Bedrooms in Washington, DC, 2000 505.3] The housing needs of District residents represent a wide spectrum. Students and young professionals may seek studios, small apartments, or shared housing. Young families may seek small condominiums, townhouses, or small homes in emerging neighborhoods. Families with children may seek homes 129 with three or four bedrooms, a yard, and perhaps a rental unit for added income. Single and couples with no children may seek single-family homes or apartments. The growing population of seniors may seek smaller houses or apartments, retirement communities, assisted living or congregate care facilities. 505.4 CITYWIDE ELEMENTS COMPREHENSIVE PLAN DISTRICT ELEMENTS ADOPTED 12/19/06 P. 1-119 An important part of growing “inclusively” is to maintain a housing stock that can fit the needs of all of these households. At its most extreme, market pressures may result in displacement as affordable large rental units are converted to “luxury” condos or upscale apartments. More often, these pressures simply mean that families are having a harder time finding suitable housing in the city. The vacancy rate provides a good barometer of this dilemma. In 2004, the vacancy rate was 8.8 percent for studios and one bedroom units, but it was just 4.4 percent for units that were two bedrooms or larger. 505.5 Policy H-1.3.1: Housing for Families Provide a larger number of housing units for families with children by encouraging new and retaining existing single family homes, duplexes, row houses, and three- and four-bedroom apartments. 505.6 Policy H-1.3.2: Tenure Diversity Encourage the production of both renter-occupied and owner-occupied housing. 505.7 Policy H-1.3.3: Assisted Living and Skilled Nursing Promote the development of assisted living and skilled nursing facilities. Zoning and health regulations should be designed to promote an increase in supply, security, and affordability of housing for the elderly. 505.8 Policy H-1.3.4: Co-operatives and Co-housing Encourage cooperatives, shared housing, and co-housing (housing with private bedrooms, but shared kitchens and common areas) as a more affordable alternative to condominiums. Ensure that such housing is appropriately regulated to avoid adverse effects on surrounding residences and neighborhoods. 505.9 Policy H-1.3.5: Student Housing Require colleges and universities to address the housing needs of their students, and promote the use of such housing by their students. 505.10 Policy H-1.3.6: Single Room Occupancy Units Allow the development of single room occupancy (SRO) housing in appropriate zone districts. 505.11 Please consult Land Use Element Policy LU-2.1.7 for policies on row house conversions to multi- family units Action H-1.3-A: Review Residential Zoning Regulations During the revision of the city’s zoning regulations, review the residential zoning regulations, particularly the R-4 (row house) zone. Make necessary changes to preserve row houses as single-family units to conserve the city’s inventory of housing for larger households. As noted in the Land Use Element, this should include creating an R-4-A zone for one- and two-family row houses, and another zone for multifamily row house flats. 505.12 H-1.4 Housing and Neighborhood Revitalization 506 Housing programs alone cannot create a livable, inclusive city. Part of attracting and retaining residents requires linking housing programs to efforts to deconcentrate poverty, improve schools, provide 130 quality retail, and upgrade services such as child care and job training. 506.1 Since 2000, the District has targeted capital investments to several formerly distressed areas that showed promise for economic and social recovery. In 2002, twelve areas were designated as “Strategic CITYWIDE ELEMENTS COMPREHENSIVE PLAN DISTRICT ELEMENTS ADOPTED 12/19/06 P. 1-120 Neighborhood Improvement Program” (SNIP) areas, with accompanying investments in housing, schools, streetscape, parks, and other public facilities. One of the shared characteristics of these areas was the opportunity for infill development on scattered vacant and abandoned sites. Several of the SNIP areas such as Columbia Heights have already transitioned into thriving mixed income neighborhoods, while others like Ivy City are just beginning to emerge. 506.2 Similar efforts have been made through the city’s Home Again program. Home Again acquires and disposes of vacant properties to private and non-profit developers through a land subsidy. The program requires that 30 percent of the new units created in each bundle of properties are sold to households at or below 60 percent of the Area Median Income (see text box On a much larger scale, the DC Housing Authority has rebuilt entire communities through the federal HOPE VI program, replacing deteriorating public housing projects like the Frederick Douglass and Stanton Dwellings with new mixed income neighborhoods like Henson Ridge. Similar efforts have been proposed through the city’s New Communities Initiative see text box 506.3 [BEGIN TEXT BOX] The New Communities Initiative 506.4 New Communities is a promising example of a city-led initiative that has the potential to reduce crime, improve neighborhood schools and health services, and create economic opportunities for public and assisted housing residents. The initiative is a partnership between DC government and the private and non-profit sectors to produce new housing, reduce violent crime, and create a healthy environment for families in some of the city’s most distressed neighborhoods. The initiative is using tax exempt bonds, low income housing tax credits, federal funds, and private investment to create mixed income housing opportunities in these areas. One-for-one replacement of older publicly assisted housing units with new publicly-assisted units is required to avoid displacement and the net loss of affordable units. Market rate and workforce housing units are included in each project to cross-subsidize the affordable units and create a mix of incomes and unit types in each project. The New Communities program seeks to advance many of the city’s community development and housing goals such as eliminating concentrations of low income and substandard housing and providing public housing residents with affordable replacement housing in the new community as it is redeveloped. Planning for the first new community (Sursum Corda) was initiated in 2004. Over the next five years, more than 500 units of subsidized housing in this troubled complex will be replaced by 1,500 units of mixed income housing. [END TEXT BOX] [BEGIN TEXT BOX] Home Again (photo to be included) The Home Again Initiative was launched in January 2002 with the goal of creating home ownership opportunities for persons of all incomes by restoring vacant and abandoned properties. The Initiative’s 131 efforts have focused on nine neighborhoods with high concentrations of such properties: Columbia Heights, Ivy City/ Trinidad, Near Northeast, Shaw/ LeDroit Park, Rosedale, Deanwood, Marshall Heights, Anacostia, and Bellevue.

Specifically explore mechanisms for residents of District-owned and District-assisted housing to purchase their residences. At the same time, work to replace units purchased with new District-owned and District-assisted housing stock. 506.6 Policy H-1.4.3: Focusing Housing Investments Direct housing improvement funds to neighborhoods with the greatest potential for sustained improvement, based on demographics, market forces, the presence of neighborhood partners and anchor institutions, and similar factors. 506.7 Policy H-1.4.4: Public Housing Renovation Continue efforts to transform distressed public and assisted housing projects into viable mixed- income neighborhoods, providing one-for-one replacement within the District of Columbia of any public housing units that are removed. Target such efforts to locations where private sector development interest can be leveraged to assist in revitalization. 506.8 Policy H-1.4.5: Scattered Site Acquisition Encourage the acquisition of individual properties on scattered sites for use as affordable housing in order to de-concentrate poverty and promote the integration of low income households into the community at large. 506.9 [SIDEBAR: “Take the risk of giving home ownership loans to low income renters to encourage as many renters to become owners as possible.” — Participant at a Comprehensive Plan workshop.] Policy H-1.4.6: Whole Neighborhood Approach Ensure that the construction of housing is accompanied by concurrent programs to improve neighborhood services, schools, job training, child care, parks, health care facilities, police and fire facilities, transportation, and emergency response capacity. 506.10 Action H-1.4-A: Renovation and Rehabilitation of Public Housing Continue federal and local programs to rehabilitate and rebuild the District’s public housing units, including but not limited to the HOPE VI program, capital and modernization programs, the Community Development Block Grant program, and the District-sponsored New Communities program. 506.11 CITYWIDE ELEMENTS COMPREHENSIVE PLAN DISTRICT ELEMENTS ADOPTED 12/19/06 P. 1-122 132 Action H-1.4-B: Home Again Initiative Continue support for the Home Again Initiative as a strategy for reducing neighborhood blight, restoring an important part of the city’s historic fabric, and providing mixed income housing in neighborhoods with relatively high concentrations of vacant or abandoned residential properties. 506.12 Action H-1.4-C: DCHA Improvements Continue the positive momentum toward improving the District’s public housing programs, including the effective training of public housing residents in home maintenance skills. In addition, residents should be involved in management and maintenance and the effective renovation, inspection, and re-occupancy of vacant units. 506.13 Action H-1.4-D: Tax Abatement Consider geographically targeted tax abatements to encourage affordable housing development in areas where housing must compete with office space for land, similar to the Downtown Tax Abatement Program. The potential costs and benefits of tax abatements must be thoroughly analyzed as they are such programs are considered. 506.14 Action H-1.4-E: Additional Public Housing Support efforts by the DC Housing Authority to use its authority to create 1,000 additional units of public housing, subsidized by funding from the US Department of Housing and Urban Development under the public housing Annual Contributions Contract (ACC This action is contingent on the availability of funds for a local rent subsidy to cover the annual operating costs for the new units. 506.15 H-1.5 Reducing Barriers to Production 507 The development of housing may be hampered by both governmental and non-governmental constraints. Governmental constraints include lengthy delays in permit processing and plan approval, insufficient coordination among agencies and utilities, zoning regulations which may not reflect contemporary housing trends, and even prohibitions on certain types of housing. Non-governmental constraints include the high cost of land and rising interest rates. Although much progress has been made in the last five years, serious barriers still exist. Fear of these barriers keeps some developers from undertaking projects in the city at all. 507.1 Policy H-1.5.1: Land and Building Regulations Ensure that the District’s land regulations, including its housing and building codes, its zoning regulations, its construction standards, and its permitting fees, enable the production of housing for all income groups. Avoid regulations which make it prohibitively expensive or difficult to construct housing. 507.2 Policy H-1.5.2: Permitting Procedures Minimize the cost and time associated with development processing, while still addressing community and environmental concerns. Explore measures to improve the permitting process, provided that such measures are consistent with other provisions of the Comprehensive Plan. 507.3 Policy H-1.5.3: Modular Construction Ensure that the District’s building and housing codes permit the appropriate use of modular and manufactured construction techniques, and other construction methods which may reduce housing costs without compromising design quality. 507.4 CITYWIDE ELEMENTS COMPREHENSIVE PLAN DISTRICT ELEMENTS ADOPTED 12/19/06 P. 1-123 Policy H-1.5.4: Financial Incentives Consider tax incentives, reduced permitting and infrastructure fees, underwriting land costs, and 133 other financial measures to reduce the cost of affordable housing construction. 507.5 Action H-1.5-A: Administrative Improvements Undertake the administrative changes outlined by the 2006 Comprehensive Housing Strategy to streamline the production and preservation of assisted and mixed income housing. These changes include the designation of a “chief of housing” to coordinate, facilitate, enable and implement city housing policy, including the policies of independent city housing and public development agencies. 507.6 Action H-1.5-B: Changes to the Zoning Regulations Explore changes which would facilitate development of accessory apartments (also called “granny flats” or in-law units English basements, and single room occupancy housing units. Any changes to existing regulations should be structured to ensure minimal impacts on surrounding uses and neighborhoods. 507.7 Action H-1.5-C: Smart Housing Codes Update and modernize the DC Housing Code to reflect the current trend toward “smart” housing codes, which are structured to encourage building rehabilitation and reuse of housing units built before modern building codes were enacted. 507.8 Action H-1.5-D: Data Management Maintain electronic inventories on existing housing and potential development sites for the benefit of residents, developers, and policy makers. This information should be used to track housing development and should be used to promote better-informed choices regarding public investment and affordable housing development. 507.9 H-2.0 Housing Conservation: Retaining Our Housing Stock 508 Preservation of housing in the District—especially affordable housing—is perhaps an even higher priority than increasing housing supply. This section focuses on two aspects of housing conservation 1) retaining affordable housing units specifically and (2) retaining existing housing stock generally. 508.1 The District has been losing affordable housing rapidly over the past five years, both through the expiration of federal subsidies and through rising market rents and sales prices. In 2005, the DC Fiscal Policy Institute indicated that rising rents alone caused a loss of 7,500 units with rent levels under $500 a month between 2000 and 2004. Over the same period, the number of homes valued at or below $150,000 decreased by 9,400. Between 2000 and 2005, the area’s annual median income rose by an average compounded rate of 1.25 percent a year, while housing prices rose at an average compounded rate of 14.4 percent a year. These changes have been especially hard on the District’s poorest residents, particularly elderly renters and those on fixed incomes. 508.2 [PULLQUOTE: The DC Fiscal Policy Institute estimated that rising rents alone caused a loss of 7,500 units with rent levels under $500 a month between 2000 and 2004. Over the same period, the number of homes valued at or below $150,000 decreased by 9,400.] An important part of housing preservation is the maintenance and upkeep of the existing housing stock. More than half of the housing units in the city are over 55 years old, and many are over 100 years old. The rise in home prices has been accompanied by a rise in building material and labor costs, making it 134 CITYWIDE ELEMENTS COMPREHENSIVE PLAN DISTRICT ELEMENTS ADOPTED 12/19/06 P. 1-124 expensive for many owners to care for their properties. In some parts of the city, lack of maintenance by absentee landlords may threaten the longevity of the housing stock and negatively affect neighborhood character. This will continue to be an issue in the future as the existing housing stock grows older and construction costs grow higher. 508.3 H-2.1 Preservation of Affordable Housing 509 In 2006, the Comprehensive Housing Strategy Task Force concluded that there were roughly 30,000 affordable and inexpensive market rate housing units throughout the District of Columbia that were at risk of being lost. This is more than 10 percent of the city’s housing stock, and it shelters many of the city’s most vulnerable residents. To avoid displacement, the District will need to channel a greater share of the revenues being created by the strong housing market into new programs that preserve affordable units. This must be a priority in the city’s most affluent areas as well as its poorest areas—indeed, preserving affordable units in affluent neighborhoods is especially important given the high cost of producing new units. 509.1 Many of the units that are at risk currently receive their funding through the federal Section 8 program. The program was initiated in 1974 and placed 20- to 40-year affordability contracts on apartment buildings. Thousands of these contracts are now expiring, with many of the units being converted to market rate rentals. In fact, half of the current project-based Section 8 dwellings are due to expire between 2005 and 2009. Many are located in gentrifying neighborhoods, and there are few incentives to building owners to keep them affordable. 509.2 Coupled with the loss of Section 8 units has been the demolition of 3,000 public housing units to make way for mixed income projects at East Capitol Gateway, Ellen Wilson, Henson Ridge, Wheeler Creek, and Arthur Capper Carrollsburg. Among these, only Ellen Wilson and Capper Carrollsburg include “one for one” replacement units for each subsidized unit removed. 509.3 Looking to the future, the city will need new programs to preserve its affordable stock, particularly its subsidized rental units. Rental housing comprises almost 60 percent of the housing stock and is the main housing option for those just entering the workforce and those without the initial resources to purchase a home. Low income renters are already more likely to pay more than half of their incomes on housing than any other group. A proposal for a District-sponsored rent subsidy program (similar to Section 8) has been included in the city’s Comprehensive Housing Strategy to offset the expiring federal subsidies and help other households who are cost-burdened. The proposal calls for direct rental assistance to 14,600 extremely low income renters. 509.4 [PULLQUOTE: Rental housing comprises almost 60 percent of the housing stock and is the main housing option for those just entering the workforce and those without the initial resources to purchase a home.] Policy H-2.1.1: Protecting Affordable Rental Housing 135 Recognize the importance of preserving rental housing affordability to the well-being of the District of Columbia and the diversity of its neighborhoods. Undertake programs to protect the supply of subsidized rental units and low-cost market rate units. 509.5 Policy H-2.1.2: Expiring Federal Subsidies Preserve expiring subsidies for affordable housing units, particularly those in Section 8-based projects, and projects funded with Low Income Housing Tax Credits and Tax Exempt Bonds, wherever possible. 509.6 CITYWIDE ELEMENTS COMPREHENSIVE PLAN DISTRICT ELEMENTS ADOPTED 12/19/06 P. 1-125 Policy H-2.1.3: Avoiding Displacement Maintain programs to minimize displacement resulting from the conversion or renovation of affordable rental housing to more costly forms of housing. These programs should include financial, technical, and counseling assistance to lower income households and the strengthening of the rights of existing tenants to purchase rental units if they are being converted to ownership units. 509.7 Policy H-2.1.4: Conversion of At-Risk Rentals to Affordable Units Support efforts to purchase affordable rental buildings that are at risk of being sold and converted to luxury apartments or condominiums, in order to retain the units as affordable. Consider a variety of programs to manage these units, such as land banks and sale to non-profit housing organizations. 509.8 Policy H-2.1.5: Long-Term Affordability Restrictions Ensure that affordable housing units that are created or preserved with public financing are protected by long-term affordability restrictions and are monitored to prevent their transfer to non-qualifying households. Except where precluded by federal programs, affordable units should remain affordable for the life of the building, with equity and asset build up opportunities provided for ownership units 509.10 Policy H-2.1.6: Rent Control Maintain rent control as a tool for moderating the affordability of older rental properties and protecting long-term residents, especially the elderly. In considering future refinements to the rent control program, the District should be careful to determine whether the proposed changes improve effectiveness, fairness and affordability without discouraging maintenance and preservation of rental housing units. 509.11 Policy H-2.1.7: Direct Rental Assistance Develop and fund programs that provide direct rental subsidies for extremely low-income households (earning less than 30% of areawide median income including homeless individuals and families in need of permanent shelter. Continue support for federally funded rental assistance programs, including public housing, project-based Section 8, and the Housing Choice Voucher Program. 509.12 Action H-2.1-A: Rehabilitation Grants Develop a rehabilitation grant program for owners of small apartment buildings, linking the grants to income limits for future tenants. Such programs have been successful in preserving housing affordability in Montgomery County and in many other jurisdictions around the country. 509.13 Action H-2.1-B: Local Rent Subsidy Implement a local rent subsidy program targeted toward newly created public housing units, newly created extremely low income housing units, and newly created units of housing for formerly homeless 136 individuals and families. 509.14 Action H-2.1-C: Purchase of Expiring Section 8 Projects Consider legislation that would give the District the right to purchase assisted, multi-family properties (and to maintain operating subsidies) where contracts are being terminated by HUD or where owners are choosing to opt out of contracts. 509.15 Action H-2.1-D: Tax Abatement for Project-Based Section 8 Units Implement the program enacted in 2002 that abates the increment in real property taxes for project- based Section 8 facilities. Consider extending the abatement to provide full property tax relief as an incentive to preserve these units as affordable. 509.16 CITYWIDE ELEMENTS COMPREHENSIVE PLAN DISTRICT ELEMENTS ADOPTED 12/19/06 P. 1-126 Action H-2.1-E: Affordable Set-Asides in Condo Conversions Implement a requirement that 20 percent of the units in all condo conversions be earmarked for qualifying low and moderate income households. The requirement should ensure that at least some affordability is retained when rental units are converted to condominiums. In addition, require condominium maintenance fees to be set proportionally to the unit price so as not to make otherwise affordable units out-of- reach due to high fees. 509.17 Action H-2.1-F: Housing Registry Develop a registry of affordable housing units in the District and a program to match these units with qualifying low income households. 509.18 H-2.2 Housing Conservation and Maintenance 510 Despite the advancing age of the District’s building stock, most of the city’s housing is in good condition. The number of vacant and abandoned units has declined sharply in the past five years, and there has been reinvestment in the housing stock in all parts of the city. There are still threats, however. “Demolition by neglect” remains an issue in some neighborhoods, while other neighborhoods face the risk of housing being converted to non-residential uses such as medical offices and non-profits. The long-term conservation of housing requires policies and actions that promote housing rehabilitation, upkeep, and modernization—while discouraging conversion to non-residential uses. 510.1 [PULLQUOTE: The long-term conservation of housing requires policies and actions that promote housing rehabilitation, upkeep, and modernization—while discouraging conversion to non- residential uses.] As noted above, housing conservation programs are particularly important for the District’s seniors (residents 65 years old and above many of whom are on fixed incomes. Seniors make up 12 percent of the city’s population, but they represent nearly 30 percent of its homeowners. This suggests a need for low interest loans, grants, tax credits, and other programs that reduce the financial burden of home ownership on low income, elderly District residents. 510.2 Policy H-2.2.1: Housing Conversion Discourage the conversion of viable, quality housing units to non-residential uses such as offices, chanceries, and hotels. Ensure that zoning regulations provide sufficient protection to avoid the loss of housing in this manner. 510.3 Policy H-2.2.2: Housing Maintenance Support voluntary, philanthropic, non-profit, private, and City-sponsored programs that assist District 137 residents in the upkeep of their homes and properties, particularly programs that provide low interest loans and grants for low income residents and elderly homeowners. 510.4 Policy H-2.2.3: Tax Relief Maintain tax relief measures for low income homeowners and low income senior homeowners faced with rising assessments and property taxes. These measures should reduce the pressure on low income owners to sell their homes and move out of the District. 510.5 Policy H-2.2.4: Energy Retrofits Encourage energy efficiency retrofits that reduce water use, and home heating and cooling costs, thereby reducing monthly housing expenditures. 510.6 CITYWIDE ELEMENTS COMPREHENSIVE PLAN DISTRICT ELEMENTS ADOPTED 12/19/06 P. 1-127 Action H-2.2-A: Housing Code Enforcement Improve the enforcement of housing codes to prevent deteriorated, unsafe, and unhealthy housing conditions, especially in areas of the city with persistent code enforcement problems. Ensure that information on tenant rights, such as how to obtain inspections, contest petitions for substantial rehabilitation, purchase multi-family buildings, and vote in conversion elections, is provided to tenants. 510.7 Action H-2.2-B: Sale of Persistent Problem Properties Address persistent housing code violations through negotiated sales of problem properties by putting properties in receivership, and through tenants’ rights education. Wherever possible, identify alternative housing resources for persons who are displaced by major code enforcement activities. 510.8 Action H-2.2-C: Low Income Homeowner Tax Credit Implement the ordinance passed by the District in 2002 to provide tax credits for long-term, low- income homeowners. 510.9 See the Historic Preservation Element for additional policies on homeowner tax credits Action H-2.2-D: Tax Relief Review existing tax relief programs for District homeowners and consider changes to help low- and moderate-income households address rising property assessments. 510.10 Action H-2.2-E: Program Assistance for Low and Moderate Income Owners Continue to offer comprehensive home maintenance and repair programs for low and moderate income owners and renters of single family homes. These programs should include counseling and technical assistance, as well as zero interest and deferred interest loans and direct financial assistance. 510.11 H-3.0 Home Ownership and Access 511 Home ownership gives individuals a stake in the community and a chance to share in its growing prosperity. It can help foster civic pride and engagement, improve family stability, and enhance support for local schools and services. Importantly, home ownership provides a long term asset to build longterm personal wealth. For these reasons, the District has had a long standing policy of helping its residents become homeowners, and promoting the construction of new owner-occupied housing in the city. 511.1 An important part of ownership is access to financing and real estate opportunity. In the past, the practice of “redlining” (e.g withholding home loan funds in certain neighborhoods) by certain lenders made it more difficult to secure home loans in parts of the city. Enforcement of Fair Housing practices is important not only to stop unfair lending practices, but also to address discrimination against renters, single parents, persons with AIDS, and others with special needs. 511.2 H-3.1 Encouraging Home Ownership 512 Nationwide, about two-thirds of all households are homeowners. In the District of Columbia, the 138 2000 census reported the home ownership rate was just 41 percent. This is one of the lowest rates in the country, well below Philadelphia (59 percent Baltimore (50 percent and Chicago (44 percent)—though higher than the 30 percent rate in New York and the 32 percent rate in Boston. The ownership rate in the CITYWIDE ELEMENTS COMPREHENSIVE PLAN DISTRICT ELEMENTS ADOPTED 12/19/06 P. 1-128 District has increased 6 percentage points since 1980, when 35 percent of the city’s households were homeowners. 512.1 The District’s Department of Housing and Community Development administers a number of programs to help residents purchase homes. These include the Homestead Housing Preservation Program, which enables first-time buyers to purchase tax delinquent properties for as little as $250. It also includes the Home Purchase Assistance Program, which offers interest-free and low-interest loans to qualified residents for the purchase of houses, condominiums, or cooperative apartments. The District also provides grants and deferred loans to government employees who are first time homebuyers. These programs are an important part of the city’s efforts to provide “workforce” housing for its residents (see text box 512.2 [BEGIN TEXT BOX] Meeting the Need for ‘Workforce Housing’ 512.3 As housing prices have outpaced income growth in many US cities, housing advocates and policy makers have called for initiatives to provide “workforce housing” for middle class residents. Workforce housing refers to housing designed for people in professions that are vital to our communities but that do not offer sufficient wages to afford market rate housing. These professions include administrative support, clerical occupations, and service jobs—and account for one-third of the jobs in the American workforce. Even with two working parents in the service industries, a family would have a difficult time purchasing a home or renting a suitable apartment in the District of Columbia. Janitors, school teachers, licensed nurses, police officers, child care professionals, and others service workers have been priced out of the DC market, and many other markets across the country. New programs, such as employer-assisted housing and down payment assistance for public sector employees, are being pursued to provide more options and keep these essential workers in our community. [END TEXT BOX] Policy H-3.1.1: Increasing Home Ownership Enhance community stability by promoting home ownership and creating opportunities for first-time home buyers in the District. Provide loans, grants, and other District programs in order to raise the District’s home ownership rate from its year 2000 figure of 41 percent to a year 2015 figure of 44 percent. Increased opportunities for home ownership should not be provided at the expense of the District’s rental housing programs, or through the displacement of low-income renters. 512.4 Policy H-3.1.2: First-Time Buyer Income Targets Structure home ownership and down payment assistance programs to benefit working families with incomes between 50 percent and 120 percent of the areawide median income. 512.5 Action H-3.1-A: HPAP Program Maintain and expand the District’s Home Purchase Assistance Program (HPAP) and Homestead Housing 139 Preservation Program. 512.6 Action H-3.1-B: District Employer Assisted Housing (EAH) Program Strengthen the District government’s existing Employer Assisted Housing (EAH) program by increasing the amount of EAH awards and removing limitations on applicants seeking to combine EAH assistance with Home Purchase Assistance Program funds. 512.7 CITYWIDE ELEMENTS COMPREHENSIVE PLAN DISTRICT ELEMENTS ADOPTED 12/19/06 P. 1-129 Action H-3.1-C: New EAH Programs Encourage other major employers in the city to develop Employer Assisted Housing programs, including Private sector employee benefit packages that include grants, forgivable loans, and onsite homeownership seminars for first-time buyers Federal programs which would assist income-eligible federal workers who currently rent in the city 512.8 Action H-3.1-D: Individual Development Accounts Invest in programs that support Individual Development Accounts that assist low-income persons to save for first-time home purchases. 512.9 Action H-3.1-E: Neighborhood Housing Finance Expand housing finance and counseling services for very low low and moderate-income homeowners, and improve the oversight and management of these services. 512.10 Action H-3.1-F: First Time Homebuyer Tax Credit Examine the feasibility of matching the Federal first-time homebuyer tax credit with a District of Columbia tax credit for homebuyers in targeted neighborhoods. 512.11 Action H-3.1-G: Tenant Purchase Program Increase assistance to tenants seeking to purchase their units. Review the effectiveness of the city’s existing Tenant Purchase program and enhance the ability of this program to provide technical, financial, legal, organizational, and language assistance to tenants in exercising their purchase rights. 512.12 H-3.2. Housing Access 513 The District established its commitment to fair housing under the Human Rights Act of 1977 (DC Law 2- 38, DC Code Sec 2-1401 (2001 ed This commitment is bolstered by federal regulations, including the Civil Rights Acts of 1964 and 1968, the Americans With Disabilities Act (ADA) of 1990, and the Age Discrimination Act of 1975. Together, these laws effectively prohibit housing discrimination on the basis of race, color, national origin, disability, sex, religion, sexual orientation, personal appearance, political affiliation, or family status. 513.1 Despite discrimination laws, DC residents may still be unfairly denied housing on the basis of the factors listed above. Common forms of discrimination include refusal to rent, “steering” to particular neighborhoods by real estate agents, setting different terms for the sale or rental of housing (such as higher security deposits for certain groups advertising to “preferred” groups, denial of loans or imposition of variable loan terms, and the use of threats and intimidation. The District will work to address these challenges in the future through full enforcement of its fair housing laws. 513.2 [Photo Caption: Working together, the Human Rights Act of 1977, Civil Rights Acts of 1964 and 1968, the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) of 1990, and the Age Discrimination Act of 1975 effectively prohibit housing discrimination.] Policy H-3.2.1: Fair Housing Enforcement 140 Strongly enforce fair housing laws to protect residents from housing discrimination. Provide education, outreach, and referral services for residents regarding their rights as tenants and buyers. Provide education and outreach to landlords, property managers, real estate agents, and others on their obligations when housing is made available. 513.3 CITYWIDE ELEMENTS COMPREHENSIVE PLAN DISTRICT ELEMENTS ADOPTED 12/19/06 P. 1-130 Policy H-3.2.2: Compliance by Recipients of District Funds Ensure that non-discrimination and full compliance with the District’s fair housing laws is required for all housing developers and service providers receiving financial assistance from the District of Columbia. 513.4 Policy H-3.2.3: Prohibition on Redlining Ensure compliance with the federal Community Investment Act of 1977, which prohibits the practice of “redlining” local neighborhoods. 513.5 Action H-3.2-A: Cultural Sensitivity Require all District agencies that deal with housing and housing services to be culturally and linguistically competent. 513.6 Action H-3.2-B: Employee Education Undertake a Fair Housing Act education program for all relevant staff persons and public officials to ensure they are familiar with the Act and their responsibilities in its enforcement. 513.7 H-4.0 Housing Those with Special Needs 514 Among Washington’s 575,000 residents are thousands of people with special needs who require targeted help finding, paying for, and maintaining affordable housing. These individuals and families include the homeless, seniors, people with physical disabilities, people living with HIV/AIDS, people with mental illness, adults reentering the city from correctional facilities, and youth being discharged from foster care and the juvenile justice system. Residents with special needs are particularly vulnerable to displacement and housing hardship. They often lack the income needed to afford safe, decent housing and the services that will help them lead normal lives in the community. 514.1 H-4.1 Integrating Special Needs Populations 515 One of the basic premises of the city’s Vision is that special needs housing should be accommodated in all neighborhoods of the city and not concentrated in a handful of areas, as it is today. The current distribution is uneven. Some neighborhoods have as many as 11 Community Based Residential Facilities while others have none. While would be unrealistic to propose that each neighborhood should have an identical number of such facilities, more can be done to avoid over-concentration. 515.1 Steps can also be taken to reduce the stigma associated with special needs housing, and to improve its compatibility with the surrounding community. This will become even more important in the future, as displacement pressures Downtown and elsewhere threaten some of the city’s emergency shelters and special needs service providers. Given limited budgets, the rising cost of land tends to drive special needs housing to the most affordable areas of the city; the very places where these uses already are concentrated. 515.2 Policy H-4.1.1: Integration of Special Needs Housing 141 Integrate special needs housing units throughout the city rather than segregating them into neighborhoods that already have high concentrations of such housing. 515.3 CITYWIDE ELEMENTS COMPREHENSIVE PLAN DISTRICT ELEMENTS ADOPTED 12/19/06 P. 1-131 Policy H-4.1.2: Emphasis on Permanent Housing Emphasize permanent housing solutions for special-needs populations rather than building more temporary, short-term housing facilities. Permanent housing is generally more acceptable to communities than transient housing, and also is more conducive to the stability of its occupants. 515.4 Policy H-4.1.3: Coordination of Housing and Support Services Coordinate the siting of special needs housing with the location of the key services that support the population being housed. The availability of affordable public transportation to reach those services also should be considered.515.5 Policy H-4.1.4: Protecting the Housing Rights of Persons with Special Needs Protect the housing rights of all residents with special needs through laws pertaining to property taxes, evictions, and affordable tenancy. 515.6 Please consult Land Use Element Section LU-3.4 for additional policies and actions on Group Homes and Community Housing. H-4.2 Meeting the Needs of Specific Groups 516 The housing needs of the District’s most vulnerable populations vary with each group. Some require housing with specific physical attributes, such as wheelchair ramps or bathrooms with grab bars. Some require housing with on-site support services, such as meal service or job counseling. Most simply need housing that is safe, secure, and affordable. Five specific groups are profiled below. 5161 Seniors In 2000, there were 70,000 District residents over 65, including 8,500 residents over 85. As the baby boom generation matures and as average lifespan increases, the population of seniors in the District is expected to increase dramatically. At the national level, the Census projects the number of senior citizens will increase by 104 percent between 2000 and 2030—almost four times the rate of the population at large. There will be a need for a broad range of senior living environments, serving residents across the income spectrum. This will be accompanied by a need for new programs, ranging from those that help seniors “age in place” through home retrofits to those that provide on-site nursing and health care in a congregate environment. As already noted, higher levels of assistance will be required to help senior homeowners on fixed incomes and to protect elderly renters from displacement. 5162 Persons with Disabilities A disproportionately large share of the region’s disabled population resides in the District of Columbia. While the city is home to just 12 percent of the region’s total population, it is home to 34 percent of its low income disabled adults. In 2000, the District was home to 82,600 disabled adults—amounting to over 20 percent of its working age population. Many of these adults are unable to work due to mental or physical handicaps, and a quarter of them earned incomes below the poverty line. The number of housing units specifically designed for persons with disabilities, particularly units in facilities with services to help cope with these disabilities, is far short of the actual need. 5163 [Photo Caption: The number of housing units specifically designed for persons with disabilities, 142 particularly units in facilities with services to help cope with these disabilities, is far short of the actual need.] CITYWIDE ELEMENTS COMPREHENSIVE PLAN DISTRICT ELEMENTS ADOPTED 12/19/06 P. 1-132 The Homeless Homelessness in the District of Columbia is a significant problem and one that has become worse in the wake of the current housing boom. In January 2005, the Metropolitan Washington Council of Governments estimated that there were 11,419 homeless persons in the region, including 2,694 who were chronically homeless. More than half of the homeless population, and two-thirds of the chronically homeless population, lived in the District. Provisions to assist the homeless must include emergency shelter, transitional housing, and permanent housing, along with supportive services. On so many levels, the need for such facilities and services outpaces supply. The shortfall will get worse if nothing is done, with more District residents at risk of becoming homeless. 516.4 Ex-Offenders and Supervised Offenders Each year, the prison system in the District of Columbia releases 9,400 people. Between 2,000 and 2,500 of these ex-offenders return to the District, usually without the means to pay for market rate housing and in some cases without the skills or means to find a decent job. Many return to neighborhoods of high crime and poverty, remain chronically unemployed, and find shelter in group homes or shared housing. Unstable housing and a lack of employment undermine an ex-offender’s success and can perpetuate the cycle of poverty and violence in the District’s poorest neighborhoods. 516.5 Persons with HIV/AIDS In 2002 the rate of reported AIDS cases in the District was 162.4 per 100,000 compared to 14.8 per 100,000 for the United States. In fact, the District has the highest incidence of AIDS in the United States, with a rate nearly double that of New York or San Francisco. In 2003, about 8,900 persons with AIDS resided in the District. Many persons with AIDS require special housing suitable for long-term care, yet a recent District survey found that the local need was double the number of units available. 516.6 Policy H-4.2.1: Short-Term and Emergency Housing Options Ensure that adequate short-term housing options, including emergency shelter and transitional housing, exists for persons with special needs, including people living with HIV/AIDS, harm-reduction units for substance abusers, detoxification beds and residential treatment facilities, halfway houses and group homes for returning offenders, and assisted-living and end-of-life care for seniors. 516.7 Policy H-4.2.2: Housing Choice for Seniors Provide a wide variety of affordable housing choices for the District’s seniors, taking into account the income range and health care needs of this population. Recognize the coming growth in the senior population so that the production and rehabilitation of publicly-assisted senior housing becomes a major governmental priority. 516.8 Policy H-4.2.3: Neighborhood-Based Senior Housing Encourage the production of multi-family senior housing in those neighborhoods characterized by large numbers of seniors living alone in single family homes. This will enable senior residents to remain in their neighborhoods and reduce their home maintenance costs and obligations. 516.9 [PULLQUOTE: Multi-family senior housing in neighborhoods where many seniors are living alone 143 in single family homes will enable seniors to remain in their neighborhoods and reduce home maintenance costs and obligations.] CITYWIDE ELEMENTS COMPREHENSIVE PLAN DISTRICT ELEMENTS ADOPTED 12/19/06 P. 1-133 Policy H-4.2.4: Barrier-Free Housing for the Disabled Work toward a target of designing eight (8) percent of the new housing units added to the city’s stock over the next 20 years specifically to meet the accessibility needs of persons with physical disabilities. These units should be spread evenly across affordability brackets. 516.10 Policy H-4.2.5: Ending Homelessness Reduce the incidence of homelessness in the city through homeless prevention efforts, development of subsidized housing for the homeless, and actively coordinating mainstream social services for persons who are homeless or at risk of becoming homeless. 516.11 Policy H-4.2.6: Housing for Ex-Offenders and Supervised Offenders Create adequate housing plans for people exiting jail or prison so that they do not become homeless, including the removal of barriers to re-entering offenders living in public housing. Ensure that exoffenders are not concentrated into assisted housing projects but can find housing throughout the city. 516.12 Policy H-4.2.7: Persons with Mental Illness Support the production of housing for people with mental illness through capital and operating subsidies. Improve the availability and coordination of such housing with wrap-around mental health and other human services.Steps should be taken to prevent the eviction of mentally ill persons from publicly financed housing so long as they are following the rules of tenancy, and to ensure that each individual’s housing is maintained if and when they need to be hospitalized. 516.13 Policy H-4.2.8: Neighborhood-Based Homeless Services Encourage the provision of homeless services through neighborhood-based supportive housing and single room occupancy (SRO) units, rather than through institution-like facilities and large-scale emergency shelters. The smaller service model can reduce the likelihood of adverse impacts to surrounding uses, improve community acceptance, and also support the reintegration of homeless individuals back into the community. 516.14 Action H-4.2-A: Incentives for Retrofits Create financial incentives for landlords to retrofit units to make them accessible to persons with disabilities, and to include units that are accessible in new housing construction. 516.15 Action H-4.2-B: Incentives for Senior Housing Explore incentives such as density bonuses, tax credits, and special financing to stimulate the development of assisted living and senior care facilities, particularly on sites well served by public transportation. 516.16 Action H-4.2-C: Homeless no More Implement the recommendations outlined in “Homeless No More: A Strategy for Ending Homelessness in Washington, DC by 2014.” Among the recommendations are the production of 2,000 permanent supportive housing units for the chronically homeless and 4,000 units of permanent housing for households who experience temporary homelessness or are at risk of becoming homeless. 516.17 Action H-4.2-D: Emergency Assistance Revive and strengthen the emergency assistance program for rent, mortgage, and/or utility expenses for very low-income families to prevent homelessness. 516.18 CITYWIDE ELEMENTS COMPREHENSIVE PLAN DISTRICT ELEMENTS ADOPTED 12/19/06 P. 1-134 144 CHAPTER 6 ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION Overview 600 The Environmental Protection Element addresses the protection, restoration, and management of the District’s land, air, water, energy, and biologic resources. The Element provides policies and actions on important issues such as drinking water safety, the restoration of our tree canopy, energy conservation, air quality, watershed protection, pollution prevention and waste management, and the remediation of contaminated sites. The health of Washington’s environment is a key indicator of the quality of life in the city. Good environmental management and pollution prevention are essential to sustain all living things and to safeguard the welfare of future generations. 600.1 The critical environmental issues facing the District of Columbia are addressed in this element. These include: Restoring the city’s tree canopy and green infrastructure Improving our rivers, streams and stream valleys Reducing erosion and stormwater run-off Sustaining plant and animal habitat Conserving water and energy Expanding recycling Encouraging green building techniques Reducing air pollution Environmental protection has been part of planning in the District since the city’s inception. In 1791, the L’Enfant Plan used the natural landscape to guide the location of avenues and principal buildings. Later plans in the 19th and 20th centuries created some of the most memorable parks in the country and designated thousands of acres for resource protection. In the 1870s, the District planted 60,000 trees, leading Harper’s Magazine to dub Washington the “City of Trees.” Today’s post-card images of the District still portray a city of blue skies, pristine waters, and lush greenery. 600.2 But reality is another story. Washington’s legacy as America’s “greenest” city has been seriously challenged over the centuries by urbanization. Our air quality does not meet federal standards, and our rivers and streams are polluted by raw sewage and urban runoff. Ninety percent of the District’s wetlands have disappeared since 1790. Some sites in the city face soil and groundwater contamination problems from former industrial uses and municipal waste disposal. Perhaps most disturbing, the city has lost much of its tree cover in the last 35 years as trees have died or been removed at a much faster rate than they have been replaced. 600.3 Fortunately, the District has turned the corner and begun to tackle these challenges head on. In 2005, legislation was passed creating a District Department of the Environment. The most ambitious tree planting, water quality, and habitat restoration projects in decades are underway, and great strides are being made to promote more sustainable growth. 600.4 The Environmental Protection Element builds on this momentum. It charts a course toward excellence in environmental quality and improved environmental health. Consistent with the notion of an “Inclusive City,” it strives for environmental justice so that all neighborhoods are provided with clean air, healthy rivers and streams, clean soils, healthy homes, and an abundance of trees and open spaces. 600.5 CITYWIDE ELEMENTS COMPREHENSIVE PLAN DISTRICT ELEMENTS ADOPTED 12/19/06 P. 1-135 Environmental Protection Goal 601 145 The overarching goal for environmental protection is as follows: Protect, restore, and enhance the natural and man-made environment in the District of Columbia, taking steps to improve environmental quality, prevent and reduce pollution, and conserve the values and functions of the District’s natural resources and ecosystems.601.1 [PULLQUOTE: The overarching goal for environmental protection is as follows: Protect, restore, and enhance the natural and man-made environment in the District of Columbia, taking steps to improve environmental quality, prevent and reduce pollution, and conserve the values and functions of the District’s natural resources and ecosystems.] Policies and Actions E-1.0 Protecting Natural and Green Areas 602 Washington, DC’s natural landscape is characterized by undulating hills, escarpments, and terraces, and a complex network of streams and valleys. This landscape provides ecological diversity, ranging from mixed oak and tulip poplar forests to magnolia bogs and wetlands. 602.1 The fundamental importance of Washington’s natural and green areas has brought a new term—green infrastructure—into the public dialogue. Green infrastructure refers to the interconnected network of land and water that supports plant and animal life, maintains natural ecology, and contributes to the health and quality of life in our communities. Our civic leaders recognize that “growing DC” requires more than bricks and mortar solutions; it also requires a concerted effort to keep Washington green. 602.2 E-1.1 Conserving and Expanding Our Urban Forest 603 The benefits of a healthy urban forest, including street trees, trees in parks and other public places, and trees on private lands, are well documented. Trees add beauty, improve mental health, reduce water pollution, absorb noise, produce oxygen and absorb greenhouse gases, and provide habitat for birds and small animals. They also add economic value to neighborhoods and contribute to community identity and pride. 603.1 A 2004 study by the Casey Trees Endowment Fund found that trees currently cover about 29 percent of the District’s land area. However, a 1999 study by American Forests determined that the percentage of “heavy tree cover” areas in the city decreased by 64 percent between 1973 and 1997. Moreover, there are significant geographic disparities in tree cover, ranging from 46 percent of the land area in Upper Northwest to just 8 percent in the Mid-City area. Public awareness of these alarming statistics has sparked tree planting and “re-greening” activities across the city. 603.2 Tree cover in the District as of 2005 is shown in Map 6.1. 603.3 [INSERT Map 6.1: Existing Tree Cover in the District of Columbia and Surrounding Region. Note: Planning Area Boundaries and Data Table removed from graphic.] CITYWIDE ELEMENTS COMPREHENSIVE PLAN DISTRICT ELEMENTS ADOPTED 12/19/06 P. 1-136 Policy E-1.1.1: Street Tree Planting and Maintenance Plant and maintain street trees in all parts of the city, particularly in areas where existing tree cover has been reduced over the last 30 years. Recognize the importance of trees in providing shade, reducing energy costs, improving air and water quality, providing urban habitat, absorbing noise, and creating economic and aesthetic value in the District’s neighborhoods. 603.4 Policy E-1.1.2: Tree Requirements in New Development Use planning, zoning, and building regulations to ensure that trees are retained and planted when new development occurs, and that dying trees are removed and replaced. If tree planting and landscaping are required as a condition of permit approval, also require provisions for ongoing maintenance. 603.6 146 Policy E-1.1.3: Landscaping Encourage the use of landscaping to beautify the city, enhance streets and public spaces, reduce stormwater runoff, and create a stronger sense of character and identity. 603.7 Policy E-1.1.4: Engaging the Community Promote partnerships between the District, community groups, and non-profit advocacy groups to undertake tree surveys and planting campaigns, volunteer training and education, and resident stewardship of Washington’s urban forest. 603.8 Action E-1.1-A: Tree Replacement Program Continue working towards a goal of planting 4,000 street trees and 2,000 trees on public open space each year. Components of this program should include the removal of dead and dying trees and their replacement with suitable species, and the pruning and maintenance of trees to eliminate hazards and increase their rate of survival. 603.9 Action E-1.1-B: Street Tree Standards Formalize the planting, pruning, removal, and construction guidelines in use by the city’s Urban Forestry Administration by developing official city street tree standards (see text box above on the city’s Tree Bill These standards should provide further direction for tree selection based on such factors as traffic volumes, street width, shade and sunlight conditions, soil conditions, disease and drought resistance, and the space available for tree wells. They should also include provisions to increase the size of tree boxes to improve tree health and longevity, and standards for soils and planting. 603.10 Action E-1.1-C: Tree Inventories Continue partnership agreements with the federal government, the Casey Trees Endowment Fund and other groups to develop a live database and management system for the District’s trees using Geographic Information System (GIS) mapping. Efforts should be made to inventory trees on parkland as well as along city streets. 603.11 Action E-1.1-D: Operating Procedures for Utility and Roadwork Develop standard operating procedures to minimize tree damage by public utility and road crews. All activities that involve invasive work around street trees should be reviewed by Urban Forestry Administration personnel. 603.12 Action E-1.1-E: Urban Forest Management Plan Consistent with the District’s Tree Bill, develop an Urban Forest Management Plan to protect, maintain, and restore trees and native woodlands across the city. The Plan should include a detailed inventory of trees and woodlands and should provide a means of coordinating urban forest management activities on all public lands managed by the city (e.g street trees, city parks, public school grounds, etc It should CITYWIDE ELEMENTS COMPREHENSIVE PLAN DISTRICT ELEMENTS ADOPTED 12/19/06 P. 1-137 also promote coordination with federal agencies and other large landowners, and include comprehensive strategies to manage insects and diseases. 603.13 [BEGIN TEXT BOX] The DC Tree Bill 603.14 The Urban Forest Preservation Act of 2001, better known as the Tree Bill, established a tree preservation program, strengthened the community notice requirements for tree removal on public land, and revised the penalties for injuring trees on public space and private property. The Tree Bill was approved in December 2002 and requires an annual program for tree planting and care, preparation of a tree master plan, and the development of maintenance standards for trees on public space. 147 The Bill includes specific provisions to protect healthy trees with a circumference of 55 inches or more. Homeowners who wish to remove such trees must replace them in kind, or pay into a tree fund used to plant new trees. Financial assistance provisions are included for low income households. The Bill also requires that ANCs are given at least 15 days written notice before a tree is removed from public space, unless the tree is deemed hazardous. [END TEXT BOX] Action E-1.1-F: Urban Tree Canopy Goals Determine the extent of the District’s tree canopy at a sufficient level of detail to establish tree canopy goals for neighborhoods across the city. Such goals have recently been developed by the USDA and tested in other cities as a way of evaluating the existing tree canopy and setting specific goals for its restoration. 603.15 E-1.2 Protecting Rivers, Wetlands, and Riparian Areas 604 Washington is situated at the confluence of two great rivers—the Anacostia and the Potomac. Both rivers have been altered over the centuries to accommodate development, highways, railroads, airports, military bases, parkland, federal monuments, and other vestiges of life in the nation’s capital. The Potomac has fared better than the Anacostia in this regard—much of its shoreline is publicly accessible and has been conserved as parkland. For years, the Anacostia suffered the fate of being of the District’s lesser known and less valued river. As its natural beauty yielded to industry, its waters became polluted and the river became a divide between more and less desirable neighborhoods. 604.1 [PULLQUOTE: As its natural beauty has yielded to industry, the Anacostia River’s waters have become polluted, and the river has become a divide between more and less desirable neighborhoods.] In the first years of the 21st century, a major initiative was launched to restore the Anacostia River. While the initiative is perhaps best known for its efforts to reclaim the shoreline for recreation and bring new life to underused sites, its programs to improve the natural environment are equally important. A range of environmental initiatives are now being implemented to restore wetlands and estuarine habitat, improve water quality, and increase environmental education about the river. When completed, these initiatives will greatly reduce sewage overflows and pollutant discharges, uncover long-buried tributary streams, and bring native plant and animal species back to the river once again. Improving the health of the Anacostia River will help achieve broader national goals for a healthier Chesapeake Bay. Map 6.2 indicates the location of rivers, streams, watersheds, and wetlands in the District of Columbia. 604.5 CITYWIDE ELEMENTS COMPREHENSIVE PLAN DISTRICT ELEMENTS ADOPTED 12/19/06 P. 1-138 Policy E-1.2.1: River Conservation Improve environmental conditions along the Anacostia River and other waterbodies, including shorelines, wetlands, islands, tributaries, and the rivers themselves. Particular attention should be given to eliminating toxic sediments, improving river edges to restore vegetation and reduce erosion, enhancing wetlands and wildlife habitat, creating new wetlands, and reducing litter. 604.6 Policy E-1.2.2: Waterfront Habitat Restoration Undertake a range of environmental initiatives along the Anacostia River to eliminate combined 148 sewer overflows, reduce urban runoff, restore wetlands and tributary streams, increase oxygen levels in the water, remediate toxins in the riverbed, clean and redevelop contaminated brownfield sites, and enhance natural habitat. [THIS POLICY WAS MOVED HERE FROM THE ANACOSTIA WATERFRONT ELEMENT. WAS SEC 1509.4] Policy E-1.2.3: Retention of Environmentally Sensitive Areas as Open Space Retain environmentally fragile areas such as wetlands and riparian areas along the Anacostia and Potomac Rivers as open space or parkland. In areas under federal jurisdiction such as Rock Creek Park, work with the National Park Service to conserve and and carefully manage such areas, and to implement an effective “no net loss” policy. 604.7 Policy E-1.2.4: Identification, Protection, and Restoration of Wetlands Identify and protect wetlands and riparian habitat on private and public land. Require official surveys when development is proposed in areas where wetlands are believed to be present to ensure that wetlands are preserved. Undertake wetlands restoration, enhancement, and creation projects to mitigate the impacts of stormwater runoff and improve plant and animal habitat. 604.8 [INSERT Map 6.2: Watersheds, Waterways, and Wetlands in DC and the Surrounding Region 604.9] Policy E-1.2.5: Wetland Buffers Maintain open space buffers around existing and restored wetlands in order to reduce the likelihood of environmental degradation from urban runoff and human activities. 604.10 Action E-1.2-A: Anacostia River Habitat Improvements Work collaboratively with federal agencies, upstream jurisdictions, the Anacostia Waterfront Corporation, and environmental advocacy groups to implement conservation measures for the Anacostia River, including Removing litter and trash on tidal flats Restoring tidal wetlands around Kingman Island and along lower Watts Branch Creating new stormwater wetlands along tributary streams Daylighting streams (i.e taking streams out of buried pipes and allowing them to run uncovered particularly Pope Branch, Fort Dupont Stream, and Stickfoot Creek Creating naturalized or bio-engineered river edges that maximize habitat value Improving bulkheads and seawalls to provide protection from flooding and erosion Requiring open space buffers consistent with the recommendations of the Anacostia Waterfront Initiative Framework Plan Preventing the net loss of parkland and improving access to the waterfront and river trails. 604.11 See the “Water Quality” section of this Element for additional recommendations for the Anacostia River watershed CITYWIDE ELEMENTS COMPREHENSIVE PLAN DISTRICT ELEMENTS ADOPTED 12/19/06 P. 1-139 Action E-1.2-B: Wetland Setback Standards Establish clear District of Columbia regulations for wetland setbacks and ensure compliance with these regulations during plan review, permitting, and inspections. 604.12 E-1.3 Conserving Soil and Reducing Erosion 605 Soils in the District of Columbia affect the suitability of land for buildings, roads and infrastructure, community gardening, and tree planting. Even in a built out city like Washington, soil and underlying geologic characteristics must be considered when designing foundations, basements, and other structures. Good soil management also involves the control of erosion resulting from natural forces like rain and wind. Erosion can undermine foundations, destabilize hillsides, and lead to sedimentation of streams. Measures to reduce erosion are particularly important during construction, when soil is disturbed and exposed to the elements. 605.1 149 Policy E-1.3.1: Preventing Erosion Ensure that public and private construction activities do not result in soil erosion or the creation of unstable soil conditions. Support the use of retaining walls and other “best management practices” that reduce erosion hazards. Erosion requirements should be implemented through building permit and plan reviews, and enforced through the permitting and regulatory processes. 605.2 Policy E-1.3.2: Grading and Vegetation Removal Encourage the retention of natural vegetation and topography on new development sites. Grading of hillside sites should be minimized and graded slopes should be quickly revegetated for stabilization. 605.3 Policy E-1.3.3: Reducing Sedimentation Prevent sedimentation of rivers and streams by implementing comprehensive stormwater management measures, including regular maintenance of storm drains and catch basins and the use of sedimentation ponds where appropriate. 605.4 Policy E-1.3.4: Restoring Eroded Areas Abate soil erosion problems in developed areas, particularly where erosion has resulted from poor site design, aging streets and alleys, or deferred maintenance. 605.5 E-1.4 Preserving Steep Slopes and Stream Valleys 606 Wooded hillsides and stream valleys provide beauty and visual relief in Washington, particularly in Upper Northwest and in neighborhoods east of the Anacostia River. Many of the city’s stream valleys have been preserved by the National Park Service, protecting local waterways and providing corridors for wildlife and recreation. But preservation alone has not fully safeguarded these areas. Development and tree removal on private properties near stream valley parks can reduce their natural, unspoiled character and cause erosion and water quality problems. Along some stream valleys, illegal dumping remains a problem. In some places, the streams themselves have been buried or diverted into stormwater culverts. 606.1 [PULLQUOTE: Development and tree removal on private properties near stream valley parks can reduce their natural, unspoiled character and cause erosion and water quality problems. Along some stream valleys, illegal dumping remains a problem. In some places, the streams themselves have been buried or diverted into stormwater culverts.] CITYWIDE ELEMENTS COMPREHENSIVE PLAN DISTRICT ELEMENTS ADOPTED 12/19/06 P. 1-140 A similar set of challenges is present on steep slopes, generally defined as slopes with a grade of 25 percent or more. As Map 6.3 indicates, such slopes are concentrated in protected areas like Rock Creek Park and the Potomac Palisades. But they are also present in neighborhoods like Forest Hills and Woodland-Normanstone, and on large sites like the St. Elizabeths Campus. In 1992, the District established a Tree and Slope Protection (TSP) Overlay Zone to reduce the alteration of terrain and removal of trees in steeply sloping and wooded areas. The overlay limits the total amount of each property that may be covered by buildings and pervious surfaces. Areas subject to the TSP Overlay are shown in Map 6.3. 606.2 Policy E-1.4.1: Conservation of Steep Slopes Strongly discourage development on steep slopes (i.e greater than 25 percent such as those found along stream valleys in Upper Northwest and Southeast DC. Planning and building regulations should ensure that any construction on such slopes is sensitively designed and includes slope stabilization 150 measures. 606.3 Policy E-1.4.2: Management of Uplands Along Stream Valleys Protect stream valley parks by limiting construction, requiring sensitive design, and retaining vegetation on adjacent upland properties. Development of land draining to stream valleys shall be managed as needed to protect flora, fauna, and water quality; prevent erosion and siltation of streams; minimize intrusion of views from the parks; and retain a green buffer between the built environment and these natural areas. 606.4 Policy E-1.4.3: Open Space Protection Along Stream Valleys Preserve land adjacent to streams and ravines as densely vegetated open space. Natural drainage channels and buffer zones in these areas should be protected from the adverse effects of nearby urban uses. Particular focus should be given to areas adjacent to Rock Creek Park and to Watts Branch, Pope Branch, Oxon Run, Battery Kemble, and Glover-Archbold Parks. 606.5 Policy E-1.4.4: Channelization of Streams Retain streams and ravines in their natural condition, rather than constructing man-made channels. Where alteration is necessary, encourage design solutions which retain or recreate natural ecological values. 606.6 [INSERT Map 6.3: Steep Slopes and Areas Subject to Tree-Slope Overlays] 606.7 [Note: Planning Area boundaries and data table removed from legend. Steep slopes and areas subject to TSP overlay accurately depicted] Action E-1.4-A: Expand the Tree and Slope Protection Overlay Work with neighborhood and community groups, homeowners and other landowners, and Advisory Neighborhood Commissions to identify additional areas where the Tree and Slope Protection (TSP) Overlay zone should be mapped. Such areas should generally abut streams or public open spaces and should have steep slopes, significant natural tree cover, and some potential for future development. Particular attention should be given to mapping the TSP Overlay on lands east of the Anacostia River. 606.8 Action E-1.4-B: Hillside Conservation Easements Explore the use of land trusts and conservation easements as a tool for protecting steep slopes and hillside areas. 606.9 CITYWIDE ELEMENTS COMPREHENSIVE PLAN DISTRICT ELEMENTS ADOPTED 12/19/06 P. 1-141 E-1.5 Sustaining Urban Plant and Animal Life 607 At the time of initial European settlement, the District of Columbia was home to species as diverse as buffalo, bear, elk, otter, and bobcat. While these animals disappeared from the local landscape decades ago, the District continues to provide habitat for hundreds of species of birds, mammals, amphibians, reptiles, fish, and invertebrates. Opossum, raccoon, red and gray foxes, and white tailed deer have adapted to human activities and are not uncommon. Much of the biodiversity can be attributed to open spaces along Rock Creek and the two rivers. However, the importance of the city’s parks, cemeteries, street trees, institutional lands, and backyards to wildlife cannot be understated. 607.1 Pursuant to federal law, the Fisheries and Wildlife Division of the District Department of Health prepared a Comprehensive Wildlife Conservation Strategy in 2005. The Strategy, which was prepared in partnership with local wildlife agencies and organizations as well as the public, is an action plan for conserving wildlife and wildlife habitats over the next ten years. It lists the species in the city with the greatest conservation needs, describes specific terrestrial and aquatic wildlife threats, and identifies priority locations for conservation. As an urban area, the District bears a high degree of responsibility for 151 conserving urban species, some of which may be threatened or endangered. 607.2 Policy E-1.5.1: Habitat Restoration Encourage interagency efforts to restore native habitat along the District’s rivers, streams, and woodlands, and public-private partnerships to recreate native habitat within the city. 607.3 Policy E-1.5.2: Protected and Rare Species As required by the federal Endangered Species Act, protect endangered, threatened, and other special status species from the adverse effects of construction and development. 607.4 Policy E-1.5.3: Habitat Management on Private Land Encourage environmentally sound landscaping and gardening techniques by DC homeowners and institutional landowners to maximize the habitat value of privately owned land. Such techniques should include reduction of herbicide and pesticide use; the selection of disease, drought-resistant, and native species; the removal of invasive plants; the use of rain gardens to reduce urban runoff; and landscaping that provides food and cover for wildlife. 607.5 Action E-1.5-A: Implementation of the Wildlife Conservation Plan Implement the 2005 Wildlife Management Plan for the District of Columbia, including programs to control the white-tailed deer and Canada goose population, and to improve water quality and habitat in the Anacostia River. 607.6 Action E-1.5-B: Data Improvements Improve the collection and monitoring of data on plant and animal life within the District, particularly data on rare, endangered, threatened, and candidate species, and species of greatest conservation need. 607.7 E-2.0 Conserving Natural Resources 608 This section of the Environmental Protection Element addresses the conservation of water and energy resources and the reduction of solid waste disposal needs. Water and energy are both limited resources, subject to growing demand and constrained supply. Their efficient use can be achieved through consumer education and behavioral changes, technological improvements, construction and design practices, regulatory and rate changes, and development of alternative sources. 608.1 CITYWIDE ELEMENTS COMPREHENSIVE PLAN DISTRICT ELEMENTS ADOPTED 12/19/06 P. 1-142 Similarly, reducing the amount of solid waste that is incinerated or disposed in landfills can have beneficial environmental and economic impacts—both on the local and the regional scale. Recycling programs, which are mandated by District law, can effectively reduce natural resource consumption, expand the local economy, and reduce the need for trash transfer facilities in the city. 608.2 E-2.1 Conserving Water 609 The District is dependent on the Potomac River for its drinking water. In most years, there is ample rainfall in the Potomac Basin to meet the city’s needs, but a plentiful supply is not always guaranteed. With competing demands for land and water in the watershed during the next 20 years, the District cannot afford to overlook opportunities for conservation. Simple measures can go a long way toward reducing the need for costly improvements to the water supply system. More significant improvements to the distribution system are also needed—for example, to reduce leaks and correct faulty meters. 609.1 [PULLQUOTE: In most years, there is ample rainfall in the Potomac Basin to meet the city’s needs, but a plentiful supply is not always guaranteed. With competing demands for land and water in the watershed during the next 20 years, the District cannot afford to overlook opportunities for conservation.] The DC Water and Sewer Authority encourages customers to use water wisely and has a number of 152 programs aimed at changing consumer behavior and improving service reliability. Looking to the future, a sustained effort by DC-WASA and other District agencies will be necessary to reduce water waste and maximize conservation. 609.2 See the Infrastructure Element for more information on water supply Policy E-2.1.1: Promoting Water Conservation Promote the efficient use of existing water supplies through a variety of water conservation measures, including the use of plumbing fixtures designed for water efficiency, drought-tolerant landscaping, and irrigation systems designed to conserve water. 609.3 Action E-2.1-A: Leak Detection and Repair Program Continue DC-WASA efforts to reduce water loss from leaking mains, including reducing the backlog of deferred maintenance, using audits and monitoring equipment to identify leaks, performing expeditious repair of leaks, and instructing customers on procedures for detecting and reporting leaks. 609.4 Action E-2.1-B: Building Code Review Continue efforts by the DC Building Code Advisory Committee to review building, plumbing, and landscaping standards and codes in order to identify possible new water conservation measures. 609.5 Action E-2.1-C: Water Conservation Education Work collaboratively with DC-WASA to promote greater awareness of the need for water conservation, and to achieve a reduction in the daily per capita consumption of water resources. Special efforts should be made to reach low income customers and institutional users. At least once a year, each customer should receive printed or electronic information on efficient water use practices, costs associated with leaking fixtures, benefits associated with conversation, and guidelines for installing water-saving plumbing devices. 609.6 CITYWIDE ELEMENTS COMPREHENSIVE PLAN DISTRICT ELEMENTS ADOPTED 12/19/06 P. 1-143 E-2.2 Conserving Energy 610 Greater energy efficiency results in a cleaner city, better air quality, and lower energy bills for District residents. More than $1.3 billion a year is spent on energy by DC residents, employees, businesses, visitors, and government. It may be possible to slow the growth of these costs in the future, even as the city adds people and jobs. Energy conservation and efficiency measures can help reduce dependency on outside energy sources, reduce energy costs for the District’s most needy residents, and improve environmental quality. 610.1 [PULLQUOTE: Energy conservation and efficiency measures can help reduce dependency on outside energy sources, reduce energy costs for the District’s most needy residents, and improve environmental quality.] In the coming years, energy supply will be challenged by competitive sales for electricity and natural gas, and projected growth in the District. Furthermore, the District is no less vulnerable than other cities and states to petroleum fuel problems caused by the limited and precarious supply of this resource. Energy supply and demand must continue to be carefully managed and efficiency must be improved in all sectors. The text box on the next page provides an overview of the Comprehensive Energy Plan, the District’s 153 official guide for meeting future energy needs. 610.2 Policy E-2.2.1: Energy Efficiency Promote the efficient use of energy, additional use of renewable energy, and a reduction of unnecessary energy expenses. The overarching objective should be to achieve reductions in per capita energy consumption by DC residents and employees. 610.3 Policy E-2.2.2: Energy Availability Improve energy availability and buffer District consumers from fluctuations in energy supply and prices. This should be achieved through the District’s energy purchasing policies, financial assistance programs for lower income customers, incentives for “green” power, and regulatory changes that ensure that local energy markets are operating efficiently. 610.4 Policy E-2.2.3: Reducing Home Heating and Cooling Costs Encourage the use of energy-efficient systems and methods for home insulation, heating, and cooling, both to conserve natural resources and also to reduce energy costs for those members of the community who are least able to afford them. 610.5 Policy E-2.2.4: Alternative Energy Sources Support the development and application of renewable energy technologies such as active, passive, and photovoltaic solar energy, fuel cells, and other sustainable sources. Such technology should be used to reduce the dependence on imported energy, provide opportunities for economic and community development, and benefit environmental quality. 610.6 [BEGIN TEXTBOX] The 2003 Comprehensive Energy Plan 610.7 In 1981, the DC Council enacted legislation to establish the DC Energy Office. This legislation (DC Law 3-132) established the Energy Office as the statutorily created lead agency on energy plans, policies and programs. It also mandated the development of a Comprehensive Energy Plan (CEP) that would propose measures to conserve energy, favorably impact the DC budget, improve the local economy, create jobs, and help the environment. The first CEP was completed in 1987, proposing 48 practical and cost- CITYWIDE ELEMENTS COMPREHENSIVE PLAN DISTRICT ELEMENTS ADOPTED 12/19/06 P. 1-144 effective measures for managing energy. An updated CEP was prepared in 1990, but was never published. In 2003, the District’s third CEP was published. It outlines 43 interconnected measures the city can take to become more energy efficient, while at the same time improving energy reliability. The Plan recognizes that there are many local and federal laws on energy that are already in place. It builds on that foundation and lays out additional practices to improve energy security and protect the natural environment. The Comprehensive Energy Plan has three major themes: “Increasing Energy Efficiency and Innovation” focuses on reducing energy consumption Enhancing Energy Availability and Affordability" concentrates on reducing the effects of the rising costs of energy Promoting Energy Collaboration and Security" addresses partnerships to help the city become energy efficient and be better prepared for energy emergencies. Recommendations in the energy plan address the major use sectors (government, residential, institutional, etc and the following topical categories: Energy Assistance, Public 154 Information/Education, Regulatory Intervention, Research and Development, and Emergency Planning. Some of the key recommendations of the CEP have been incorporated as Comp Plan actions. The CEP itself should be reviewed for additional detail. [END TEXTBOX] Policy E-2.2.5: Energy Efficient Building and Site Planning Include provisions for energy efficiency and for the use of alternative energy sources in the District’s planning, zoning, and building standards. The planning and design of new development should contribute to energy efficiency goals. 610.8 Policy E-2.2.6: Energy Efficiency at Major Employment Centers Continue efforts that enable major employers in the city, including the government, institutions, schools, and the private sector to implement energy conservation measures. 610.9 Policy E-2.2.7: Consumer Education on Energy Promote citizen awareness concerning energy issues through educational and demonstration initiatives and other programs. 610.10 Policy E-2.2.8: Conserving Energy Through Rate Structure Continue to propose rate changes that encourage the efficient use of energy resources. Economic incentives and disincentives should vary based on the different classes of ratepayers, and should contribute to the economic viability of alternative energy sources. 610.11 Policy E-2.2.9: Energy Security Promote energy security through partnerships that enable the District to respond to energy emergencies and interruptions in supply. Participate in regional efforts to plan for such emergencies, including those organized by the Metropolitan Washington Council of Governments. 610.12 Action E-2.2-A: Energy Conservation Measures Pursuant to the District’s Comprehensive Energy Plan, implement energy conservation programs for the residential, commercial, and institutional sectors. These programs include financial incentives, technical CITYWIDE ELEMENTS COMPREHENSIVE PLAN DISTRICT ELEMENTS ADOPTED 12/19/06 P. 1-145 assistance, building and site design standards, public outreach, and other measures to reduce energy consumption and improve efficiency. 610.13 Action E-2.2-B: Assistance Programs for Lower Income Households Implement Comprehensive Energy Plan programs to reduce energy costs for lower income households, including the Low Income Home Energy Assistance Program (LIHEAP) and additional measures to reduce monthly energy costs. 610.14 Action E-2.2-C: Consumer Education on Energy Implement the District’s Comprehensive Energy Plan recommendations for education and public information on energy issues, including school curricula, awards programs, demonstration projects, websites, and multi-media production. 610.15 Action E-2.2-D: Energy Regulatory Reforms Enact legislative and regulatory reforms aimed at improving energy efficiency in the city in order to reduce energy costs and improve reliability. 610.16 Action E-2.2-E: Energy Emergency Plan Prepare an energy emergency response plan by updating and consolidating existing emergency plans and working in collaboration with regional partners such as MWCOG. Regularly scheduled training for energy emergencies should be provided to appropriate District personnel. 610.17 Action E-2.2-F: Review of DC Codes and Regulations for Energy Features Review local building codes and zoning regulations to identify potential barriers to achieving energy efficiency goals—and to identify possible changes which would support energy goals. Building and 155 zoning codes should be amended as necessary to encourage energy efficiency, and to remove barriers to using solar power and other renewable sources. 610.18 E-2.3 Reducing Solid Waste Disposal Needs 611 In 1988, the District passed legislation requiring recycling in commercial buildings and setting targets for residential recycling. The legislation also contained provisions for District government to increase the use of recycled products through its procurement practices. Despite these mandates, recycling efforts were sporadic during the 1990s and it was not until the early 2000s that most of the current programs were initiated. DC still lags behind many U.S. cities in the percentage of waste it diverts from landfills; however, recent improvements have been significant. 611.1 [PULLQUOTE: Recycling efforts were sporadic during the 1990s and it was not until the early 2000s that most of the current programs were initiated. DC still lags behind many U.S. cities in the percentage of waste it diverts from landfills; however, recent improvements have been significant.] In 2002, the District began implementing a three-year timeline for all District agencies and facilities to achieve a recycling target of 45 percent (by weight) for the separation and collection of the total solid waste stream. Today, the District has a curbside recycling program and a number of programs to promote recycling and source reduction within the government (see “Greening the Government” at the end of this chapter Additional waste diversion can be achieved through public education, recycling of construction and demolition debris, and expanded recycling in schools, offices, and other places of employment. Among the many benefits of recycling is the fact that it reduces demand on the city’s trash transfer stations, with attendant benefits to nearby neighborhoods. 611.2 See the Infrastructure Element for more information on solid waste disposal CITYWIDE ELEMENTS COMPREHENSIVE PLAN DISTRICT ELEMENTS ADOPTED 12/19/06 P. 1-146 Policy E-2.3.1: Solid Waste Source Reduction and Recycling Actively promote the reduction of the solid waste stream through reduction, reuse, recycling, recovery, composting, and other measures. Use appropriate regulatory, management, and marketing strategies to inform residents and businesses about recycling and composting opportunities, and best practices for reducing the amount of waste requiring landfill disposal or incineration. 611.3 Policy E-2.3.2: Construction and Demolition Recycling Support the recycling of construction and demolition debris as a key strategy for reducing the volume of waste requiring landfill disposal. To carry out this policy, encourage the “deconstruction” of obsolete buildings rather than traditional demolition. Deconstruction dismantles buildings piece by piece and makes the components available for resale and reuse. 611.4 Action E-2.3-A: Expanding District Recycling Programs Continue implementation of the citywide recycling initiative started in 2002, which sets the long- term goal of recycling 45 percent of all waste generated in the District. Special efforts should be made to expand workplace recycling through a combined education and inspection/ enforcement campaign, conduct “best practices” studies of successful recycling programs in other jurisdictions, and plan for the recycling of yard waste. 611.5 Action E-2.3-B: Expand Recycling Efforts in District Institutions Work with the DC Public Schools and Public Charter Schools to expand school recycling programs and activities. Encourage private schools, universities, colleges, hospitals, and other large institutional 156 employers to do likewise. 611.6 Action E-2.3-C: Revisions to Planning and Building Standards for Solid Waste Review building code standards for solid waste collection to ensure that new structures are designed to encourage and accommodate recycling and convenient trash pickup. 611.7 Action E-2.3-D: Installation of Sidewalk Recycling Receptacles Install receptacles for sidewalk recycling in Downtown DC and other neighborhood commercial centers with high pedestrian volume as a way of increasing waste diversion and publicly reaffirming the District’s commitment to recycling. 611.8 Action E-2.3-E: E-Cycling Program Establish E-cycling programs and other measures to promote the recycling of computers and other electronic products in an environmentally sound manner. 611.9 Action E-2.3-F: Commercial and Industrial Waste Reduction Work with the commercial and industrial sectors to foster appropriate source reduction and waste minimization activities, such as the environmentally sound recycling and disposal of mercury- containing fluorescent lamps and electronic equipment. 611.10 E-3.0 Promoting Environmental Sustainability 612 The term “sustainability” has many definitions. At its core, it refers to managing our resources so that they are not permanently depleted or lost for future generations. On a local level, this principle suggests that we take care to protect our city’s natural features for future residents and visitors to enjoy. On a global level, it suggests that we reduce the consumption of natural resources as we pursue the goal of being a more inclusive city. 612.1 CITYWIDE ELEMENTS COMPREHENSIVE PLAN DISTRICT ELEMENTS ADOPTED 12/19/06 P. 1-147 [PULLQUOTE: At its core, the term “sustainability” refers to managing our resources so that they are not permanently depleted or lost for future generations. Locally, it suggests that we take care to protect our city’s natural features for future residents and visitors to enjoy. Globally, it suggests that we reduce the consumption of natural resources as we pursue the goal of being a more inclusive city.] Four principal objectives for growing more sustainably are described here a) First, encouraging “low impact” development that retains as much stormwater as possible on-site, thereby protecting local waterways from pollution (b) Second, promoting “green building”—that is, buildings that are designed through an integrated process that considers site planning, architecture, engineering, and the environment together, and that incorporate recycled materials, advanced energy and water conservation systems, and minimal use of toxic or hazardous materials (c) Third, providing opportunities for food production and urban gardening (d) Fourth, ensuring that the environmental impacts of development are mitigated and monitored. 612.2 E-3.1 Low Impact Development 613 Low Impact Development (LID) refers to a variety of construction and design techniques that conserve the natural hydrology of development or redevelopment sites. It includes small-scale practices that allow water to infiltrate, evaporate, or transpire on-site rather than flowing off and entering local storm drains and waterways. In urban areas like the District of Columbia, typical LID measures include green roofs (which absorb rainwater and also reduce energy costs porous pavement, limits on impervious surface cover, rain barrels, and rain gardens. On larger development sites in the city, LID measures could include 157 such features as artificial wetlands, stormwater detention ponds, and earthen drainage swales. 613.1 Policy E-3.1.1: Maximizing Permeable Surfaces Encourage the use of permeable materials for parking lots, driveways, walkways, and other paved surfaces as a way to absorb stormwater and reduce urban runoff. 613.2 Policy E-3.1.2: Using Landscaping and Green Roofs to Reduce Runoff Promote an increase in tree planting and landscaping to reduce stormwater runoff, including the expanded use of green roofs in new construction and adaptive reuse, and the application of tree and landscaping standards for parking lots and other large paved surfaces. 613.3 Policy E-3.1.3: Green Engineering Promote green engineering practices for water and wastewater systems. These practices include design techniques, operational methods, and technology to reduce environmental damage and the toxicity of waste generated. 613.4 Action E-3.1-A: Low Impact Development Criteria Establish Low Impact Development criteria for new development, including provisions for expanded use of porous pavement, bioretention facilities, and green roofs. Also, explore the expanded use of impervious surface limits in the District’s Zoning Regulations to encourage the use of green roofs, porous pavement, and other means of reducing stormwater runoff. 613.5 CITYWIDE ELEMENTS COMPREHENSIVE PLAN DISTRICT ELEMENTS ADOPTED 12/19/06 P. 1-148 Action E-3.1-B: LID Demonstration Projects Complete one demonstration project a year that illustrates use of Low Impact Development (LID) technology, and make the project standards and specifications available for application to other projects in the city. Such demonstration projects should be coordinated to maximize environmental benefits, monitored to evaluate their impacts, and expanded as time and money allow. 613.6 Action E-3.1-C: Road Construction Standards Explore changes to DDOT’s street, gutter, curb, sidewalk, and parking lot standards that would accommodate expanded use of porous pavement (and other low impact development methods) on sidewalks, road surfaces, and other paved surfaces, or that would otherwise aid in controlling or improving the quality of runoff. 613.7 E-3.2 Promoting Green Building 614 “Green” building standards are also gaining acceptance as a means of growing more sustainably. The Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design (LEED) rating system, established by the Green Building Council, establishes varying levels of certification for green buildings based on the degree to which they mitigate the pollution created during building construction as well as the long-term effects resulting from building operation. Typical green building strategies include the use of light-colored paving materials to reduce heat build-up, recycled building materials, and energy-conserving windows and insulation methods. Green buildings are also designed to avoid indoor air quality problems, and to encourage pedestrian and bicycle accessibility. 614.1 Policy E-3.2.1: Support for Green Building Encourage the use of green building methods in new construction and rehabilitation projects, and develop green building methods for operation and maintenance activities. 614.2 Policy E-3.2.2: Green Building Education and Awareness Support programs that educate District employees, the building and real estate communities, and the public regarding the benefits and techniques of green building. 614.3 Action E-3.2-A: Building Code Revisions Evaluate regulatory obstacles to green building construction in the District, and work to reduce or eliminate such obstacles if they exist. Adopt amendments to the International Construction Code as 158 necessary to promote green building methods and materials, and to encourage such actions as stormwater harvesting, graywater reuse, waterless urinals, and composting toilets. 614.4 Action E-3.2-B: Green Building Incentives Establish a Green Building Incentive Program, addressing both new construction and the rehabilitation of existing structures. Such a program could include financial incentives, such as rebates on LEED certification fees, tax abatement, reduced permit fees, grants, low interest rehabilitation loans, and streamlined permit processing for projects meeting LEED certification standards. 614.5 See also Action E-5.1-A on green building requirements for city projects and projects receiving city funds Action E-3.2-C: NOMA Demonstration Project Pursue a pilot project to apply green building guidelines and development standards in the North-of- Massachusetts Avenue (NOMA) area. If the program is successful, expand its application to other parts of the city where large-scale development is expected during the next 20 years. 614.6 CITYWIDE ELEMENTS COMPREHENSIVE PLAN DISTRICT ELEMENTS ADOPTED 12/19/06 P. 1-149 Action E-3.2.-D: Sustainability Action Agenda Develop a Sustainability Action Agenda to promote green building practices and other forms of sustainable architecture, landscape architecture, and development in the city. 614.7 E-3.3 Enhancing Food Production and Urban Gardening 615 With more than 60 percent of District residents living in multi-family housing with limited access to private open space, community gardens provide an important resource. There are more than 30 such gardens in the city, each independently operated. Community gardens not only provide a place to grow fruits, vegetables, and flowers, they also provide an environmental, recreational, cultural, and educational asset in the neighborhoods they serve. Our community gardening associations are complemented by a network of local gardening clubs, promoting neighborhood beautification and public space stewardship projects across the city. While these organizations typically operate without District assistance, they provide an important public service to DC residents. 615.1 [PULLQUOTE: Community gardens not only provide a place to grow fruits, vegetables, and flowers, they also provide an environmental, recreational, cultural, and educational asset in the neighborhoods they serve.] Policy E-3.3.1: Promotion of Community Gardens Continue to encourage and support the development of community gardens on public and private land across the city. 615.2 Policy E-3.3.2: Capacity Building for Community Gardening and Garden Club Groups Enhance the capacity of private and non-profit community gardening organizations to develop and operate community gardens. This should include working with the private sector and local foundations to mobilize financial support. 615.3 Policy E-3.3.3: Domestic Gardening Provide technical and educational support to District residents who wish to plant backyard and rooftop gardens. This could include measures such as partnerships with local gardening groups; education through conferences, websites, and publications; tool lending programs; integrated pest management; and information on composting and best practices in gardening. 615.4 Policy E-3.3.4: Schoolyard Greening Work with DC Public and Charter Schools to make appropriate portions of buildings and grounds available for community gardens, and to use buildings and grounds for instructional programs in environmental science and gardening classes. Encourage private schools to do likewise. 615.6 Policy E-3.3.5: Produce and Farmers Markets 159 Encourage the creation and maintenance of produce markets in all quadrants of the city to provide outlets for community gardens and healthful, locally grown produce for District residents. 615.7 Action E-3.3-A: Community Gardens East of the Anacostia River Recognizing that only two of the city’s 31 community gardens are located east of the Anacostia River, work with community leaders and gardening advocates to establish new gardens in this area. The District should assist in this effort by providing an inventory of publicly and privately owned tracts of land that are suitable for community gardens, and then working with local advocacy groups to make such sites available. 615.8 CITYWIDE ELEMENTS COMPREHENSIVE PLAN DISTRICT ELEMENTS ADOPTED 12/19/06 P. 1-150 Action E-3.3-B: Support for UDC Cooperative Extension Enhance the capability of the Cooperative Extension of the University of the District of Columbia to provide technical assistance and research, including educational materials and programs, to support citizen gardening and tree planting efforts. 615.9 E-3.4 Reducing the Environmental Impacts of Development 616 The District of Columbia Environmental Policy Act (DCEPA modeled after the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA requires all District agencies to analyze and disclose the environmental effects of their major actions, including the permitting of new development. Environmental Impact Statements are required for projects that are likely to have substantial negative impacts on the environment. 616.1 To determine if a project meets this threshold, applicants must complete a simple checklist called an “Environmental Impact Screening Form” (EISF Unlike the NEPA “Environmental Assessment,” the EISF contains simple yes/no questions and requires no narrative or analysis. The policies and actions below call for a more rigorous analysis of impacts in the future, with more substantive documentation of environmental effects. 616.2 Policy E-3.4.1: Mitigating Development Impacts Take measures to ensure that future development mitigates impacts on the natural environment and results in environmental improvements wherever feasible. Construction practices which result in unstable soil and hillside conditions or which degrade natural resources without mitigation shall be prohibited. 616.3 Policy E-3.4.2: Transparency of Environmental Decision-Making Ensure that discussions and decisions regarding environmental impacts and mitigation measures occur through a transparent process in which the public is kept informed and given a meaningful opportunity to participate.616.4 [SIDEBAR: “The environment is our most precious resource – we must work to enhance and preserve it.” — Participant at a Comprehensive Plan workshop] Policy E-3.4.3: Environmental Assessments Ensure full and meaningful compliance with the DC Environmental Policy Act, including the use of procedures to assess the environmental impacts of major development projects comparable to the regulations developed by the Council on Environmental Quality for the National Environmental Policy Act. The environmental review should include all pertinent information about the effects of the project on the human environment, including information about existing conditions, projected impacts, and mitigation measures. The process should ensure that such information is available when a development is 160 proposed and is available to the public and decision-makers before any decision is made. 616.5 Policy E-3.4.4: Monitoring of Operational and Construction Impacts Strengthen District government programs that monitor and resolve air pollution, water pollution, noise, soil contamination, dust, vibration, and other environmental impacts resulting from commercial uses, industrial uses, trucking, construction activities, and other activities around the city that could potentially degrade environmental quality. 616.6 Action E-3.4-A: Citywide Natural Resource Inventory Compile and maintain a citywide natural resources inventory that catalogs and monitors the location and condition of the District’s natural resources. The inventory should be used as a benchmark to evaluate the success of environmental programs and the impacts of land use and development decisions. 616.7 CITYWIDE ELEMENTS COMPREHENSIVE PLAN DISTRICT ELEMENTS ADOPTED 12/19/06 P. 1-151 Action E-3.4-B: Strengthening Environmental Screening and Assessment Procedures Implement a program to strengthen the environmental screening, assessment, impact statement, and notification requirements in the District of Columbia. Based on an analysis of existing practices in the District and “best practices” around the country, recommend statutory and procedural changes to more effectively document and mitigate the environmental impacts of development and infrastructure projects, and to ensure that impacted residents, businesses, and DC agencies have adequate opportunities for review and comment. In adoption of any new environmental standards or procedures, consideration should be given to the cost of compliance for affected businesses, the opportunities for public participation, and the cost to the environment if the standards/ procedures are not implemented. 616.8 Action E-3.4-C: Environmental Enforcement Undertake an interagency effort to improve compliance with the District’s existing environmental laws and regulations. This effort should include public education, compliance assistance, and the convening of an environmental crime and enforcement working group. 616.9 E-4.0 Reducing Environmental Hazards 617 Environmental hazards in the District of Columbia include air and water pollution, contaminated soils, hazardous materials, noise, disease vectors, flooding, light pollution, and electromagnetic fields. The overall purpose of Comprehensive Plan policies on these topics is to minimize the potential for damage, disease, and injury resulting from these hazards. Environmental hazards define basic constraints to land use that must be reflected in how and where development takes place. The severity of these hazards also helps define the priority for future remediation and abatement programs. 617.1 The presence of environmental hazards in the city also means that up-to-date emergency response planning is essential. As indicated in the Community Services and Facilities Element, the District’s Emergency Management Agency is charged with preparing and implementing these plans, and ensuring that District agencies, residents, and businesses are informed and prepared in the event of a disaster or other emergency. Other agencies, including the Environmental Health Administration and the District Department of Transportation, also are actively involved in emergency planning and response. 617.2 E-4.1 Reducing Air Pollution 618 Most Washington residents have experienced the effects of poor air quality at one time or another. On smoggy summer days, the Washington Monument and National Cathedral may not even be visible 161 from high vantage points in the city. However, the most serious effects of air pollution are on human health. These range from minor problems like watery eyes and headaches to serious respiratory problems and heart ailments. 618.1 The greatest contributor to air pollution in the Washington area is motor vehicle emissions. Emissions from local smokestacks and other “stationary” sources are fairly limited, although the District is subject to such pollution from upwind states. While cleaner-burning gasoline has helped reduce pollution to some degree, urban sprawl and accompanying congestion have countered this gain. Clearly, reducing motor vehicle emissions is not something the District can do on its own. Numerous multi-state organizations and regional committees exist to address the issue, all working toward compliance with federal Clean Air Act standards. These entities focus not only on reducing vehicle emissions, but also on curbing other sources of pollution, ranging from power plants and jet fuel to consumer products such as paints, lawnmowers, and home fireplaces and barbecues. 618.2 CITYWIDE ELEMENTS COMPREHENSIVE PLAN DISTRICT ELEMENTS ADOPTED 12/19/06 P. 1-152 The Clean Air Act establishes standards for six criteria pollutants. These are carbon monoxide, lead, nitrogen oxide, ozone, particulate matter, and sulfur dioxide. Areas where these standards are not met are designated as “non-attainment” by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA As of 2005, the Washington area is classified as a moderate non-attainment area for the federal 8-hour ozone standard. The region is also a non-attainment area for ground level ozone and for fine particulates. Because of this status, the District (along with Maryland and Virginia) must prepare “State Implementation Plans” (SIPs) to demonstrate how they will attain federal air quality standards. 618.3 Figure 6.1 shows the number of days the federal 8-hour ozone standard was exceeded at three monitoring locations in the District between 1995 and 2005. Exceedances fluctuate from year to year, and appear to be highest during years of warmer weather. During the last three years, the federal standard was exceeded fewer than five days a year, but was exceeded more than 20 days during 2002. 618.4 Policy E-4.1.1: Attaining Air Quality Standards Continue to undertake programs and initiatives that move the region closer to attaining and maintaining federal air quality standards. Expand these programs as feasible to incorporate new technology and to reflect best practices around the country. 618.5 Policy E-4.1.2: Regional Planning Recognize that air quality is a regional issue that requires multi-jurisdictional strategies and solutions. Accordingly, work with surrounding cities, counties, states, the federal government, and appropriate regional organizations to more effectively conduct air quality planning. 618.6 Policy E-4.1.3: Evaluating Development Impacts On Air Quality Evaluate potential air emissions from new and expanded development, including transportation improvements and municipal facilities, to ensure that measures are taken to mitigate any possible adverse impacts. These measures should include construction controls to reduce airborne dust, and requirements for landscaping and tree planting to absorb carbon monoxide and other pollutants. 618.7 [INSERT Figure 6.1: Exceedances of the Federal 8-Hour Ozone Standard, 1995-2005 618.9] 162 Policy E-4.1.4: Stationary Sources Maintain controls on gaseous and particulate emissions from stationary sources of air pollution in the city, such as power plants and refrigeration plants. Particular attention should be given to monitoring the air quality impacts of local power plants, which are the largest stationary sources of air pollution in the District. 618.10 [PULLQUOTE: Promote strategies that reduce motor vehicle emissions in the District and surrounding region. This includes the development of a fully integrated regional system of buses, streetcars, rail transit, bicycles, taxis, and pedestrian facilities to make it easier and more convenient to travel without an automobile.] Policy E-4.1.5: Improving Air Quality Through Transportation Efficiency Promote strategies that reduce motor vehicle emissions in the District and surrounding region. As outlined in the Land Use and Transportation Elements of this Comprehensive Plan, this includes the development of a fully integrated regional system of buses, streetcars, rail transit, bicycles, taxis, and pedestrian facilities to make it easier and more convenient to travel without an automobile. It also includes the promotion of trip reduction measures such as videoconference facilities, telecommuting, flextime, and carpooling. Strategies to reduce congestion and idling time, such as improved signal timing and reversible commute lanes also should contribute to air quality improvement. 618.11 CITYWIDE ELEMENTS COMPREHENSIVE PLAN DISTRICT ELEMENTS ADOPTED 12/19/06 P. 1-153 Policy E-4.1.6: Clean Fuels Encourage the use of clean fuel vehicles and enhance efforts to place refueling and recharging equipment at facilities accessible for public use. Where feasible, provide financial incentives for District residents and business to use clean vehicles, such as reduced motor vehicle tax and license fees. 618.12 Policy E-4.1.7: Best Available Control Technology Encourage the use of best available control technology for minor sources of air pollution such as boilers, generators, and construction and maintenance equipment. 618.13 Policy E-4.1.8: Air Quality Education Support increased public awareness of air quality issues through “Air Quality Action Day” programs, publication of air quality data, and distribution of educational materials that outline steps residents and businesses can take to help maintain clean air.618.14 Action E-4.1-A: State Implementation Plan (SIP) Cooperate with appropriate state, regional and federal agencies to carry out the federally-mandated State Implementation Plan (SIP) in order to attain federal standards for ground level ozone and fine particulate matter by 2010. 618.15 Action E-4.1-B: Control of Bus and Truck Emissions Collaborate with WMATA and local tour bus operators to reduce diesel bus emissions through the acquisition and use of clean fuel transit vehicles. Additionally, encourage natural gas powered, electric powered, and hybrid commercial trucks to reduce emissions and improve air quality. 618.16 Action E-4.1-C: Motor Vehicle Inspection Programs Regularly update the District’s motor vehicle inspection and maintenance program to ensure that the latest emission control and monitoring technologies are being employed. Consider expanding requirements for heavy vehicle emission inspections. 618.17 Action E-4.1-D: Air Quality Monitoring Continue to operate a system of air quality monitors around the District, and take corrective actions 163 in the event the monitors exceed federal standards. 618.18 Action E-4.1-E: Cities for Climate Protection Campaign Implement the U.S. Mayors Climate Protection Agreement, signed by the District in 2005. Also implement the recommendations for reducing greenhouse gas emissions contained in the District of Columbia Greenhouse Gas Emissions Inventories and Preliminary Projections released in October 2005. This agreement aims to reduce global warming pollution levels to seven percent below 1990 levels by 2012, the levels set by the Kyoto Protocol for developed countries. 618.19 See the Transportation Element for additional policies on improving mass transit, pedestrian and bicycle circulation, and transportation management. [BEGIN SIDEBAR] The Link Between Land Use, Transportation, and Air Quality 618.20 Land use and transportation policies work in tandem to affect our region’s air quality. In general, the more “vehicle miles” Washington area residents must travel to reach home, work, shopping, and services, the worse our air quality becomes. Longer commutes are compounded by traffic congestion, which results in additional emissions from idling cars. Despite the use of cleaner-burning fuels, attaining CITYWIDE ELEMENTS COMPREHENSIVE PLAN DISTRICT ELEMENTS ADOPTED 12/19/06 P. 1-154 federal air quality standards will be difficult until we fundamentally rethink the way we as a region handle our growth. The District is fortunate to have one of the best transit systems in the country and many options to traveling without a car. But we’re not an island. Our air is impacted from pollution from the suburbs, and by power plant emissions from places as far away as the Ohio Valley. The city can do its part to contribute to air quality improvements by focusing on two key land use strategies. First, directing future growth to parts of the city where car ownership is an option and not a necessity. Second, encouraging the mixing of land uses such as housing, shopping, and offices to reduce the need for routine car trips. As the Land Use Element of this Plan notes, and as previous Comprehensive Plans for the District have noted, “transit-oriented development” around Metrorail stations and along bus corridors can help create a city with cleaner air and more housing and transportation choices for its residents. [END SIDEBAR] E-4.2 Reducing Water Pollution 619 Like cities across the United States, the District of Columbia faces the challenge of combating the pollution of its rivers, streams, and groundwater. The problem dates to colonial days when the city disposed of sewage and agricultural waste in its rivers. While the days of open sewers and unregulated dumping are behind us, we are left with the most polluted tributary of the Chesapeake Bay. Swimming in our rivers is considered hazardous and fishing is ill-advised. 619.1 Most of the pollutants entering Washington’s waters cannot be traced to specific points. Oil, gas, dust, pesticides, trash, animal waste, and other pollutants are carried to rivers and streams each time it rains. Vegetated and unpaved areas absorb some of these pollutants, while paved surfaces do not. Industrial uses like power plants and military bases also impact water quality. Toxins from these uses have contaminated the groundwater in certain areas and have settled into riverbeds, creating the danger that they will be re-released if the sediment is disturbed. In addition, urban runoff carries high volumes of fast-moving water to local streams, scouring natural channels and stripping away the resources necessary 164 to support local fish and wildlife. 619.2 As noted in the Infrastructure Element, storm sewers serve the dual purpose of conveying sewage as well as rainwater in about one-third of the city. During major storms or snow melts, stormwater and sanitary sewage flows exceed the capacity of the conveyance system, causing raw sewage to be released into the Anacostia and Potomac Rivers, Rock Creek, and tributary streams. Billions of gallons of sewage may be dumped into the river during such events, lowering oxygen levels and damaging aquatic life. 619.3 The federal Clean Water Act required the District to take steps to control stormwater pollution and eventually meet clean water standards. The Long-Term Control Plan for sanitary and storm sewer separation is one of these steps. Another is the Municipal Separate Storm Sewer System (MS4) permit, which includes specific requirements for the two-thirds of the city where storm and sanitary sewers are already separated. The MS4 program, which is managed by the DC Water and Sewer Authority, covers the control of discharges from industrial and construction sites, monitoring of these discharges, enforcement activities for violators, and annual reporting and implementation. In 2001, the District passed legislation authorizing the collection of fees to fund these activities. 619.4 As with air quality, water quality improvements cannot be tackled by the District alone. The Anacostia watershed includes 176 square miles and over 80 percent of this area is in Maryland. The Potomac CITYWIDE ELEMENTS COMPREHENSIVE PLAN DISTRICT ELEMENTS ADOPTED 12/19/06 P. 1-155 watershed is larger still—over 14,600 square miles—and extends as far as West Virginia and Pennsylvania. A number of interstate and multi-agency initiatives have been launched to address water quality problems. These must be sustained and expanded in the future. 619.5 Policy E-4.2.1: Improving Water Quality Improve the quality of water in the District’s rivers and streams to meet public health and water quality standards, and maintain the physical, chemical, and biological integrity of these watercourses for multiple uses, including recreation and aquatic life. 619.6 Policy E-4.2.2: Wastewater Treatment Provide sustained capital investment in the District’s wastewater treatment system in order to reduce overflows of untreated sewage and improve the quality of effluent discharged to surface waters. Ensure that the Blue Plains treatment plant is maintained and upgraded as needed to meet capacity needs and to incorporate technological advances in wastewater treatment. 619.7 See the Infrastructure Element for a discussion of plans to separate storm and sanitary sewers Policy E-4.2.3: Control of Urban Runoff Continue to implement water pollution control and “best management practice” measures aimed at slowing urban runoff and reducing pollution, including the flow of sediment and nutrients into streams, rivers, and wetlands. 619.8 Policy E-4.2.4: Riverbed Sediment Reduce the level of toxins in Anacostia and Potomac River sediment. Remediation measures should minimize the possibility of water contamination resulting from dredging or disturbances of the river bottom. 619.9 Policy E-4.2.5: Groundwater Protection Protect Washington’s groundwater from the adverse effects of urban uses. Contaminated groundwater should be investigated to determine whether long term monitoring or treatment is necessary or feasible. 165 Future land uses and activities should be managed to minimize public exposure to groundwater hazards and reduce the likelihood of future contamination. 619.10 Policy E-4.2.6: Control of Illicit Discharges Provide public outreach and education, and maintain inspection and enforcement procedures to control illicit discharges into the city’s storm drains and waterways. 619.11 Policy E-4.2.7: Regional Coordination Promote planning at the watershed level, particularly cooperative efforts with Maryland to address existing pollution loads in the Anacostia River basin. Undertake similar efforts with jurisdictions in the Potomac watershed to address water quality in the Potomac River. 619.12 Action E-4.2-A: Stormwater Management Plan Create a comprehensive multi-agency stormwater management plan covering such topics as low impact development LID maintenance of LID infrastructure, education, impervious surface regulations, fees, and water quality education. The plan should include output and outcome measures that achieve specific water quality standards, reevaluate and clarify stormwater standards to eliminate confusion, and propose fee levels that are sufficient to maintain an effective stormwater management program and encourage residents and businesses to reduce stormwater pollution. 619.13 CITYWIDE ELEMENTS COMPREHENSIVE PLAN DISTRICT ELEMENTS ADOPTED 12/19/06 P. 1-156 Action E-4.2-B: Funding Continue to aggressively lobby for funding for water quality improvements, including abatement of combined sewer overflow, removal of toxins, and Anacostia River clean-up. Seek additional funding from Maryland and Virginia and set incentive-based fee structures for DC residents. 619.14 Action E-4.2-C: Monitoring and Enforcement Maintain a District water pollution control program that implements water quality standards, regulates land disturbing activities (to reduce sediment monitors and inspects permitted facilities in the city, and comprehensively monitors DC waters to identify and stop violations. This program should be adequately staffed to carry out its mission and to implement innovative stormwater management programs. Other environmental programs, including underground storage tank regulation, contaminated site remediation, and pesticide control programs, must take groundwater impacts into account in their regulatory and enforcement activities. 619.15 [PULLQUOTE: Maintain a District water pollution control program that implements water quality standards, regulates land disturbing activities (to reduce sediment monitors and inspects permitted facilities in the city, and comprehensively monitors DC waters to identify and stop violations.] Action E-4.2-D: Clean Water Education Working with DC-WASA and the newly created DC Department of the Environment, increase public information, education, and outreach efforts on stormwater pollution. These efforts could include such measures as community clean-ups, storm drain stenciling, school curricula, demonstration projects, signage, and advertisement and media campaigns. 619.16 Action E-4.2-E: TMDL Program Implementation Implement Total Maximum Daily Load (TMDL) plans for the Potomac and Anacostia Rivers, Oxon Run, Watts Branch, Rock Creek, Kingman Lake, the Washington Channel, and other tributaries as required by the Clean Water Act. A TMDL sets the quantity of a pollutant that may be introduced into a water body. 166 As a critical step in implementing these requirements, waste load allocations for individual sources or discharges (including city entities) into the municipal stormwater system should be assigned and the technologies and management practices to control stormwater should be identified. 619.17 Action E-4.2-F: Houseboat Regulations Improve regulation of houseboats and other floating structures in the Washington Channel, Anacostia River, and Potomac River to reduce water pollution. 619.18 Action E-4.2-G: Green Marinas Promote the Green Marina Program of the Marine Environmental Education Foundation, encouraging boat clubs and marinas to voluntarily change their operating procedures to reduce pollution to District waters. 619.19 E-4.3 Controlling Noise 620 Noise affects the general health and well-being of District residents. High noise levels can create a host of problems, ranging from stress to hearing loss. Noise can also impact urban wildlife. In the noisiest parts of the city, the sounds of cars, trucks, buses, helicopters, and sirens may seem almost constant. Even in relatively quiet parts of the city, household noise sources like car alarms and leaf blowers can be a source of annoyance. Regardless of density, the maintenance of “peace and quiet” is a basic expectation in most District neighborhoods. 620.1 CITYWIDE ELEMENTS COMPREHENSIVE PLAN DISTRICT ELEMENTS ADOPTED 12/19/06 P. 1-157 Reducing exposure to noise requires strategies that address both noise “sources” like freeways and airports and noise “receptors” like homes, schools, and hospitals. It also involves the enforcement of ordinances regulating the hours of operation for noise-generating activities, like construction and machinery use. The District Department of Consumer and Regulatory Affairs (DCRA) enforces Chapter 27 of the DC Municipal Regulations Title 20, which formally declares the “policy of the District that every person is entitled to ambient noise levels that are not detrimental to life, health, and enjoyment of his or her property” and further that “excessive or unnecessary noises within the District are a menace to the welfare and prosperity of residents and businesses.” 620.2 [PULLQUOTE: Reducing exposure to noise requires strategies that address both noise “sources” like freeways and airports and noise “receptors” like homes, schools, and hospitals. It also involves the enforcement of ordinances regulating the hours of operation for noise-generating activities, like construction and machinery use.] Noise reduction measures also address highways and aviation. The District has a noise abatement and barrier policy for highways, in compliance with Federal Highway Act requirements. Efforts have focused on I-395 and I-295/ Kenilworth Avenue. Airport noise reduction measures, including regulations on flight paths, hours of operation, aircraft type and model, and helicopters, are coordinated through the Metropolitan Washington Council of Governments. 620.3 Policy E-4.3.1: Interior Noise Standards Ensure that interior noise levels in new buildings and major renovation projects comply with federal noise standards and guidelines. Support the retrofitting of existing structures to meet noise standards where they are currently exceeded. 620.4 Policy E-4.3.2: Reduction of Vehicle Noise Provide regulatory, mitigation, and monitoring measures to minimize exposure to noise from vehicular traffic, including buses, trucks, autos, and trains. Encourage the use of landscaping and sound barriers to reduce exposure to noise along freeways, rail lines, and other transportation corridors. 620.5 167 Policy E-4.3.3: Household Noise Control Strengthen enforcement of local ordinances and regulations that limit sources of household noise in the city, including noise originating from car alarms, construction activities, mechanical equipment and machinery, and similar sources. 620.6 Policy E-4.3.4: Airport Noise Control Work with appropriate federal and regional agencies to continue aircraft noise reduction programs related to Washington Reagan National Airport, especially in neighborhoods along the Potomac and Anacostia Rivers. 620.7 Policy E-4.3.5: Noise and Land Use Compatibility Avoid locating new land uses that generate excessive noise adjacent to sensitive uses such as housing, hospitals, and schools. Conversely, avoid locating new noise-sensitive uses within areas where noise levels exceed federal and District guidelines for those uses. 620.8 Action E-4.3-A: Evaluation of Noise Control Measures Evaluate the District’s noise control measures to identify possible regulatory and programmatic improvements, including increased education and outreach on noise standards and requirements. 620.9 CITYWIDE ELEMENTS COMPREHENSIVE PLAN DISTRICT ELEMENTS ADOPTED 12/19/06 P. 1-158 Action E-4.3-B: Enforcement of Noise Regulations Pursuant to the DC Municipal Regulations, continue to enforce laws governing maximum day and nighttime levels for commercial, industrial and residential land uses, motor vehicle operation, solid waste collection and hauling equipment, and the operation of construction equipment and other noise- generating activities. 620.10 Action E-4.3-C: Aviation Improvements to Reduce Noise Actively participate in the Committee on Noise Abatement and Aviation at National and Dulles Airports (CONAANDA) to reduce noise levels associated with take offs and landings at Washington-Reagan National Airport. Particular emphasis should be placed on limiting nighttime operations, reducing the use of older and noisier aircraft, maintaining noise monitoring stations within the District, and following flight path and thrust management measures that minimize noise over District neighborhoods. 620.11 Action E-4.3-D: Reduction of Helicopter Noise Encourage the federal government to reduce noise from the operation of helicopters, especially over residential areas along the Potomac and Anacostia Rivers during night-time and early morning hours. 620.12 Action E-4.3-E: Measuring Noise Impacts Require evaluations of noise impacts and noise exposure when large-scale development is proposed, and when capital improvements and transportation facility changes are proposed. 620.13 Action E-4.3-F: I-295 Freeway Noise Buffering Consistent with DDOT’s noise abatement policy, continue to pursue the development of sound barriers and landscaping to shield neighborhoods abutting the I-295 (Anacostia) Freeway, Kenilworth Avenue, and I-395 (SE/SW Freeway) from noise levels that exceed acceptable standards. 620.14 E-4.4 Managing Hazardous Substances 621 Hazardous substances include materials that may pose a threat to human health or the environment when they are improperly handled, stored, or disposed. While this may conjure up images of highly- secured industrial or military compounds, the use of hazardous substances is common in households and businesses across the city—from the perchloroethylene used by dry cleaners, to the pesticides and 168 herbicides used in lawn care, to common cleansers and solvents used in District households. Hazardous building materials such as asbestos, lead, and mercury may be present in many of the city’s older structures. Naturally occurring hazards such as radon, and biological contaminants such as mold, also may be present. 621.1 Hazardous materials are also transported through the city on trucks and in rail cars. Even if all handling, transport, and storage regulations are properly followed, such substances may pose a risk in the event of an accidental spill or act of terrorism. 621.2 A complex set of federal and District regulations govern hazardous substance handling. Many of these regulations are implemented through District programs designed to reduce public health hazards and to protect the environment. These include underground storage tank regulation, clean-up programs for contaminated sites, toxic substance investigations, and household hazardous waste disposal programs. The level of investigation and clean-up required at any given site depends both on the degree of contamination, existing land uses, and the particular land use that is planned there in the future. Looking forward, pollution prevention practices (including hazardous waste minimization and toxic chemical source reduction stronger environmental review procedures, and continued remediation measures can CITYWIDE ELEMENTS COMPREHENSIVE PLAN DISTRICT ELEMENTS ADOPTED 12/19/06 P. 1-159 reduce the likelihood of exposure to hazardous materials and ensure public safety and the protection of ecological resources. 621.3 Vigilance must be taken to enforce regulations regarding the transport of hazardous materials through the city. This continues to be a high priority of the District’s Emergency Management Agency, both to protect the security of District residents, workers, and visitors, and to ensure swift and effective response in the event of an emergency. 621.4 Policy E-4.4.1: Hazardous Substances Management Develop and implement programs to manage the use, handling, transportation, storage and disposal of harmful chemical, biological, and radioactive materials including expanded enforcement of local regulations and the establishment of training programs on hazardous materials and emergency planning. 621.5 Policy E-4.4.2: Hazardous Building Materials and Conditions Protect public health and safety by testing for and, where appropriate, removing lead, radon gas, asbestos, and other hazardous substances from the built environment. When these hazards are abated, require full compliance with all applicable licensing and inspection standards. 621.6 Policy E-4.4.3: Accidental Spills and Releases Ensure compliance with District laws relating to the notification and reporting of accidental spills and releases of hazardous materials. Improve public education and awareness of these requirements as part of a broader effort to improve emergency planning, preparedness and response in the city. 621.7 Policy E-4.4.4: Toxic Chemical Source Reduction and Disposal Encourage the substitution of non-toxic or less toxic chemicals and products for toxic chemicals and products in all businesses and households. Provide options for the disposal of hazardous waste generated by households and small businesses to minimize illegal and harmful dumping. Maintain penalties and 169 fines for the illegal dumping of materials such as used oil and batteries. 621.8 Policy E-4.4.5: Clean-Up of Contaminated Sites Ensure that the necessary steps are taken to remediate soil and groundwater contamination in the city, both in areas where future development is likely and in areas that are already fully developed. In addition, require soil and groundwater evaluations for any development that is proposed on a site where contamination may be possible due to past activities. Depending on the site, it may also be necessary to investigate the effects of contamination on air quality, surface water, or river sediments, or to conduct an ecological risk assessment. If contamination is found to be above acceptable levels, require remediation and, where necessary, long term monitoring and institutional controls. 621.9 [PULLQUOTE: Ensure that the necessary steps are taken to remediate soil and groundwater contamination in the city, both in areas where future development is likely and in areas that are already fully developed.] Policy E-4.4.6: Hazardous Substances and Land Use Ensure that land use planning and development decisions minimize the exposure of residents, workers, and visitors to hazardous substances. New residences, schools, and similarly sensitive uses should not be sited in areas where significant quantities of hazardous substances are handled, stored, or disposed. Likewise, new municipal or industrial facilities that use toxic materials or produce hazardous waste should not be sited in residential or environmentally sensitive areas. 621.10 CITYWIDE ELEMENTS COMPREHENSIVE PLAN DISTRICT ELEMENTS ADOPTED 12/19/06 P. 1-160 Policy E-4.4.7: Design Considerations For uses where hazardous substances are handled, require design and construction practices that minimize the possibility of hazardous spills, accidents, leaks, or security breaches—and encourage other measures as necessary to prevent injury and disease, and protect property and natural resources. 621.11 Policy E-4.4.8: Hazardous Materials Transport Regulate and guide the transport of hazardous materials through the District to minimize risks to human health, property, and the environment. 621.12 See the Land Use Element for additional policies on conflicts between Industrial and Residential uses, and the Community Services and Facilities Element for further discussion of emergency preparedness Action E-4.4-A: Household Hazardous Waste Disposal Expand the District’s education and outreach programs on the dangers of household hazardous wastes and continue to sponsor and publicize household hazardous waste collection events. Provide additional sites and regularly scheduled events for the safe collection and disposal of such wastes. Explore options for addressing the collection and disposal of hazardous waste from businesses that are classified as conditionally exempt small quantity generators. 621.13 Action E-4.4-B: Compliance with Hazardous Substance Regulations Maintain regulatory and inspection programs to ensure that all businesses that store, distribute, or dispose of hazardous materials comply with all applicable health, safety, and environmental requirements. These requirements range from used oil collection facilities at automotive repair shops to emergency contingency plans for the PEPCO power plant to disposal of medical waste from area hospitals and clinics. 621.14 170 Action E-4.4-C: Reducing Exposure to Hazard Building Materials Implement programs to reduce exposure to hazardous building materials and conditions, including the existing radon gas testing program, the asbestos program, and the childhood lead poisoning prevention and lead-based paint management programs. The latter programs are designed to eliminate childhood lead poisoning citywide by 2010 and to regulate the lead abatement industry to ensure the use of safe work practices. District programs should provide technical and financial support to the owners of residential properties, and particularly resident homeowners, for the abatement of these hazards. 621.15 [PULLQUOTE: Implement programs to reduce exposure to hazardous building materials and conditions, including the existing radon gas testing program, the asbestos program, and the childhood lead poisoning prevention and lead-based paint management programs. ] Action E-4.4-D: Underground Storage Tank Management Maintain and implement regulations to monitor underground storage tanks (UST) that store gasoline, petroleum products, and hazardous substances. Prevent future releases from USTs to soil and groundwater; abate leaking tanks and other hazardous conditions, remediate contaminated sites; and provide public education on UST hazards. 621.16 Action E-4.4-E: Reductions in Pesticide Use Maintain a pesticide management program that complies with the District’s Municipal Regulations for pesticide registration, operator/applicator certification, and handling/use. Implement new programs to promote integrated pest management by the public and private sectors and discourage the use of harmful pesticides by District residents, instutitions, and businesses. 621.17 CITYWIDE ELEMENTS COMPREHENSIVE PLAN DISTRICT ELEMENTS ADOPTED 12/19/06 P. 1-161 E-4.4-F: Hazardous Substance Response and Water Pollution Control Plans Complete the hazardous substance response plan required under the District’s Brownfields Act, and update the water pollution control contingency plan, as required under the District’s Water Pollution Control Act. E-4.5 Drinking Water Safety 622 Drinking water quality in the District is impacted by land use in the Potomac Basin and by the condition of the city’s water distribution system. Runoff from upstream development, dairy and hog farms, and other agricultural and mining uses presents an ongoing threat to water supply. Even if our water supply were pristine, however, the pipes used to transport water from treatment facilities to individual customers would affect water quality. Some of these pipes are more than 100 years old and are in poor condition. Problems with old, leaky water pipes are compounded by hundreds of “cross connections” with sewer lines, and “dead ends” where water does not adequately circulate. 622.1 A related water supply issue is exposure to lead. Lead may enter our drinking water as a result of corrosion of pipes and plumbing fixtures. Lead service lines between the distribution system and individual homes are relatively common in the city, comprising about 23,000 of the District’s 130,000 service lines. While the risk of lead poisoning is very low for most, it can be more significant for infants and children. Tests conducted in 2004 showed elevated levels of lead in tap water, prompting a collaborative effort by the DC Water and Sewer Authority, the EPA, and the District Department of Health to accelerate service line replacement, increase monitoring, and enact corrosion control measures. 622.2 Policy E-4.5.1: Drinking Water Safety Ensure the safety of the city’s drinking water supply and distribution system. Maintain sustained 171 efforts to reduce health hazards associated with lead and other contaminants. 622.3 Action E-4.5-A: Lead Pipe Testing and Replacement Aggressively implement programs to test for lead, replace lead feeder pipes, and educate the community on safe drinking water issues and stagnant water control. 622.4 Action E-4.5-B: Source Water Protection Implement measures to protect natural systems and abate pollution sources in the Potomac Basin that could potentially impact the District’s drinking water quality. 622.5 Action E-4.5-C: Interagency Working Group Create an interagency working group on safe drinking water to address drinking water emergencies; coordination between DCWASA and DOH, and expanded public education on water supply. 622.6 E-4.6 Sanitation, Litter, and Environmental Health 623 Among the many aspects of environmental health in the District are the maintenance of sanitary conditions, the reduction of litter, and the control of disease-carrying pests. The District’s Department of Health maintains numerous programs to reduce food-borne illness, ensure compliance with hygiene standards, provide for animal and welfare control, and reduce exposure to animal-transmitted diseases like rabies and West Nile Virus. 623.1 Litter and trash are probably the most visible and pervasive forms of pollution in Washington. A variety of programs have been launched to combat litter, including the District’s Clean City Initiative and the “Keep Washington, DC Beautiful” program, an affiliate of the national “Keep America Beautiful” CITYWIDE ELEMENTS COMPREHENSIVE PLAN DISTRICT ELEMENTS ADOPTED 12/19/06 P. 1-162 program. These programs emphasize rapid District response to dumping problems; organization of neighborhood clean-up programs; education about local litter, rodent control, and dumping laws; and strengthening and enforcement of these laws. 623.2 Policy E-4.6.1: Vector Control Continue and strengthen efforts to control rats, mice, mosquitoes, and other disease vectors and pests. A variety of related strategies should be used to support these programs, including public outreach and education, garbage control and containment, adequate trash and refuse collection services, ongoing maintenance of public space, enforcement of littering and dumping regulations, clean-up of construction and demolition debris, structural controls and integrated pest management, and a reduction in the number of vacant and abandoned buildings. 623.3 Policy E-4.6.2: Clean City Programs Improve environmental quality through programs that promote efficient trash removal, neighborhood clean-ups, and levying of fines and penalties for abandonment of personal property (including cars) and illegal dumping. 623.4 Policy E-4.6.3: Discouraging Illegal Dumping Develop and maintain effective public education and enforcement tools to curb littering and illegal dumping, and to promote the safe disposal of solid waste (including hazardous waste, medical waste, construction debris, used oil, and scrap tires) and bulky items. 623.5 Policy E-4.6.4: Environmental Health Activities Maintain and improve existing District programs to ensure community hygiene, food and restaurant safety, animal and welfare control, and the control of disease vectors. Promote continuous coordination among District agencies to ensure healthful and sanitary conditions throughout the District. 623.6 Action E-4.6-A: Expanded Trash Collection and Street Sweeping Explore the feasibility of expanding trash collection services and street sweeping schedules to improve the cleanup of vacant properties, roadsides, public spaces, parks, and city-owned lands. 623.7 Action E-4.6-B: Neighborhood Clean-Ups 172 Co-sponsor and participate in neighborhood and citywide clean-up activities such as those currently held along the Potomac and Anacostia Rivers, and those held around schoolyards and District parks. Encourage Advisory Neighborhood Commissions and other community groups to develop and announce cleanup campaigns in conjunction with the city’s bulk trash removal schedule. 623.8 Action E-4.6-C: Strengthening and Enforcement of Dumping Laws Take measures to strengthen and enforce the District’s littering, rodent and disease vector control, and illegal dumping laws. These measures should include a) providing adequate funding to carry out anti-littering programs b) empowering the community to report illegal dumping activities c) increasing public education on dumping laws, including posting of signs where appropriate; and (d) expanding surveying and enforcement activities. 623.9 Action E-4.6-D: Publicizing Bulk Waste Disposal Options Continue to sponsor and publicize options for bulk waste disposal, including information on the Fort Totten transfer station and the District’s schedule for curbside bulk trash waste removal. 623.10 See the Hazardous Materials section of this chapter for additional actions relating to hazardous waste disposal. CITYWIDE ELEMENTS COMPREHENSIVE PLAN DISTRICT ELEMENTS ADOPTED 12/19/06 P. 1-163 E-4.7 Other Hazards and Pollutants 624 Three other environmental hazards are addressed in this Comprehensive Plan. The first—light pollution—has been raised in the past around the Naval Observatory in Northwest DC. In some parts of the city, brighter lighting may be desirable to enhance public safety or illuminate our civic buildings and monuments. In other areas, dark skies are more desirable and lighting can be an irritant. Where lighting is required or desired, steps can be taken to use the correct amount of lighting for the desired purpose, direct the lighting appropriately, employ energy efficient lighting devices, and design and install quality lighting that reduces sharp contrast, glare, and halo effects. 624.1 The second hazard—electromagnetic fields (EMF)—is an issue principally associated with communication antennas and electric power facilities. While antennas have been part of the District’s landscape for years, the widespread use of mobile phones and personal communication devices in the last decade have resulted in a proliferation of requests for new facilities. Although the National Research Council has found “no conclusive and consistent evidence” linking ordinary exposure to EMF with human health, the American Medical Association has recommended a policy of prudent avoidance. The intent is to reduce the exposure of residents and workers to EMF radiation and ensure compliance with all Federal Communications Commission siting standards. 624.2 The third hazard addressed below is flooding. Portions of the District are within the FEMA- designated 100-year flood plain and are subject to inundation during hurricanes and other severe storms. Although the District’s flood-prone areas are generally parkland, ongoing efforts are needed to maintain seawalls, reduce erosion, replace undersized culverts, and keep streambeds free of debris. 624.3 [PULLQUOTE: Portions of the District are within the FEMA-designated 100-year flood plain and are subject to inundation during hurricanes and other severe storms.] Policy E-4.7.1: Prudent Avoidance of Electromagnetic Field Impacts Incorporate prudent avoidance in decisions regarding the approval, location or routing, and intensity of 173 facilities that generate electromagnetic fields, such as power lines and communication antennas. Such facilities should be located only when and where necessary based on local service needs, and should be designed using methods to mitigate involuntary public exposure to potential adverse effects. 624.4 Policy E-4.7.2: Co-Location of Antennas Consider the joint use and co-location of communication antennas to reduce the number of towers necessary, thereby reducing aesthetic impacts and limiting the area of radiofrequency exposure. 624.5 Policy E-4.7.3: Light Pollution Maintain regulations for outdoor lighting to reduce light pollution and conserve energy. Particular attention should be given to preventing glare and nighttime light trespass in the vicinity of the Naval Observatory, so that its operational needs are respected. 624.6 Policy E-4.7.4: Flood Plains Restrict development within FEMA-designated flood plain areas. Consistent with the Federal Elements of the Comprehensive Plan, prohibit activities within these areas that could pose public health or safety hazards in the event of a flood. Regulation of land uses in flood plains, waterfronts, and other lowlying areas should consider the long-term effects of global warming and sea-level rise on flood hazards. 624.7 CITYWIDE ELEMENTS COMPREHENSIVE PLAN DISTRICT ELEMENTS ADOPTED 12/19/06 P. 1-164 E-4.8 Achieving Environmental Justice 625 Environmental justice refers to the fair treatment of people of all races, cultures, and incomes with respect to the development, adoption, implementation, and enforcement of environmental laws, regulations, and policies. It is about equal and fair access to a healthy environment, and equal enforcement of environmental regulation regardless of community characteristics. 625.1 These are particularly important principles to abide by when the goal of the Comprehensive Plan is to grow an inclusive city. Clearly, some District neighborhoods have been adversely impacted by pollutiongenerating uses and activities in the past. As the city grows and changes, a greater effort must be made to repair the damage done by these uses and to avoid their over concentrations in the future. All residents should have a fair and meaningful opportunity to participate in environmental decisions. 625.2 Policy E-4.8.1: Environmental Justice Address the over-concentration of industrial uses in the District’s lower income communities. Develop solutions to reduce the adverse effects of these uses, such as enhanced buffering, sound walls, operational improvements, truck routing, increased monitoring of impacts, and zoning changes to reduce land use conflicts. 625.3 Policy E-4.8.2: Expanded Outreach to Disadvantaged Communities Expand local efforts to involve economically disadvantaged communities, particularly those communities that historically have been impacted by power plants, trash transfer stations, and other municipal or industrial uses, in the planning and development processes. 625.4 Action E-4.8-A: Health Impacts of Municipal and Industrial Uses Continue to study the link between public health and the location of municipal and industrial uses such as power plants and waste treatment facilities. The findings of such studies should be used to inform public policy decisions and minimize future community health impacts. 625.5 E-5.0 Environment, Education, and the Economy 626 The final section of this Element presents policies and actions that tie environmental quality to strategic 174 decisions about government operations, economic growth, and education in the District of Columbia. These policies take the Environmental Protection Element beyond its traditional focus to a new level that recognizes the link between environmental quality and the broader goals set by Vision for Growing an Inclusive City. The basic premise is that environmental protection should not be seen as a regulatory burden or added expense, but rather as a measure of our stewardship and respect for the earth. Environmental protection can ultimately reduce the cost of doing business by reducing accidents, disease, and waste. It can create jobs for District residents, strengthen tourism and hospitality, improve the educational experience for District students, and make the District a more attractive and healthy place for those who live and work here. 626.1 E-5.1 Greening the Government 627 The District needs to set high standards for its own operations if it expects others in the community to follow suit. It should be a role model in energy efficiency, green building construction, low impact development, and environmentally sound landscaping. It should lead the way in recycling and composting solid waste, using recycled goods, and procuring “green power.” 627.1 CITYWIDE ELEMENTS COMPREHENSIVE PLAN DISTRICT ELEMENTS ADOPTED 12/19/06 P. 1-165 [PULLQUOTE: The District needs to set high standards for its own operations if it expects others in the community to follow suit. It should be a role model in energy efficiency, green building construction, low impact development, and environmentally sound landscaping.] In 2003, a Mayor’s Order established a “Greening the Government” subcommittee comprised of directors from almost 20 District agencies. The subcommittee was charged with setting priorities and measurable goals to further energy efficiency and environmental health in District government workplaces. It was asked to implement energy efficiency measures, educate the District workforce, and bring green building practices into District buildings. The subcommittee produced a Strategic Plan in 2004; key elements of that Plan are summarized in the policies and actions below. 627.2 Policy E-5.1.1: Low Impact Development and Green Building Methods for the District Strongly encourage the use of low impact development (LID) methods and green building design methods and materials in new construction and major rehabilitation projects undertaken by the District of Columbia government. 627.3 Policy E-5.1.2: Environmental Audits Conduct environmental “audits,” including energy audits, of District government facilities to guide decisions about retrofits and other conservation measures. Environmental audits should also be required any time the District leases space for government use. 627.4 Policy E-5.1.3: Environmentally Friendly Government Operations Promote energy efficient and environmentally friendly District government operations, including the purchase of recycled and recyclable products, procurement of “green power” for District operations where feasible, the use of energy saving equipment, and contracting practices which include incentives for sustainable technology. 627.5 Policy E-5.1.4: Sustainable Landscaping Encourage landscaping practices on District properties that reduce the need for watering and mowing, control the spread of invasive species, increase the use of landscaping for stormwater management, and 175 reduce the use of pesticides and herbicides. 627.6 Action E-5.1-A: Green Building Legislation Adopt and implement legislation establishing green building standards for projects constructed by the District of Columbia or receiving funding assistance from the District of Columbia. 627.8 Action E-5.1-B: Energy Management Plans Require the submittal and periodic updating of Energy Management Plans by District agencies. These plans should establish baseline data for assessing the effectiveness of each agency’s energy conservation measures. 627.9 E-5.2 Environmental Education and Stewardship 628 A key element of the District’s environmental strategy is increased environmental education. This should begin with collaborative efforts between local non-profits, the private sector, District and federal governments, and our K-12 schools. Aquatic and wildlife education programs instill appreciation of natural resources in our youth and provide them with knowledge and skills that they may use later in life. Environmental education activities should continue with adult programs, professional development for teachers, and outreach to the business community on environmental quality issues. These programs should move the city beyond environmental awareness to increased stewardship and informed action. 628.1 CITYWIDE ELEMENTS COMPREHENSIVE PLAN DISTRICT ELEMENTS ADOPTED 12/19/06 P. 1-166 [PULLQUOTE: Aquatic and wildlife education programs instill appreciation of natural resources in our youth and provide them with knowledge and skills that they may use later in life. Environmental education activities should continue with adult programs, professional development for teachers, and outreach to the business community on environmental quality issues.] Policy E-5.2.1: Environmental Education in District Schools Develop or expand programs to educate youth from pre-school to high school about the importance of protecting the environment. 628.2 Policy E-5.2.2: Continuing Education on the Environment Encourage greater participation by residents, business owners, institutions, and public agencies in maintaining environmental standards. This should be achieved through public education, media, outreach and awareness campaigns, compliance assistance, and environmental enforcement programs. Typical programs could include recycling projects, creek clean-ups, and tree planting initiatives. 628.3 Policy E-5.2.3: Interpretive Centers Support the development of environmental education and nature centers in the District, particularly in recovering habitat areas such as the Anacostia River shoreline. 628.4 Policy E-5.2.4: Demonstration Projects Encourage best practice guides, demonstration projects, tours, and other tools to create a culture where the “green choice” (i.e the choice that results in greater energy efficiency and better environmental health) is the preferred choice for energy, transportation, construction, and design decisions. 628.5 See also Parks, Recreation, and Open Space Policy PROS-2.2.8 on Stewardship of Public Space. Action E-5.2-A: Partnerships for Environmental Education Develop partnerships with environmental non-profits and advocacy groups to promote environmental education in the District. Examples of such programs include the Earth Conservation Corps effort to employ inner-city youth in environmental restoration along the Anacostia River, the Anacostia Watershed Society’s tree planting, clean-up, and riverboat tour events, and the National Park Service summer 176 programs for high school students at Kenilworth Park. 628.6 Action E-5.2-B: Production of Green Guide Produce a “Green Guide” aimed at homeowners, builders, contractors and the community at large with guidelines and information on green building and low-impact development. 628.7 E-5.3 Environment and the Economy 629 Environmental and economic development goals intersect with respect to the redevelopment of “brownfield” sites. Brownfields include industrial, commercial, institutional, or government sites that are abandoned or underutilized, in part due to environmental contamination or perceived contamination. Their redevelopment provides the opportunity to revitalize distressed communities, increase property tax revenue, and create new jobs. In the District, a “Voluntary Clean Up Program” has been initiated to provide incentives to clean up brownfields and put them back into active use. There are currently six sites participating in this program. 629.1 Linked to the redevelopment of brownfields is the idea of “growing” the environmental sector of the District’s economy. A number of DC-based organizations have pioneered the idea of building a “green collar” workforce to demonstrate how employment and natural resource conservation can sustain one CITYWIDE ELEMENTS COMPREHENSIVE PLAN DISTRICT ELEMENTS ADOPTED 12/19/06 P. 1-167 another. Training programs have been established to help DC youth find jobs in green construction, horticulture, parks and recreation, landscaping, recycling, and similar professions. The District can contribute to these programs through initiatives to attract “green businesses” to the city. Such efforts can help diversify the economy and provide new jobs while advancing the sustainability goals of the Comprehensive Plan. 629.2 Policy E-5.3.1: Brownfield Remediation Clean up and redevelop contaminated “brownfield” sites, providing new business and job opportunities and expanding land resources for economic development, open space, and other purposes. Provide financial incentives for the remediation and redevelopment of these sites. 629.3 Policy E-5.3.2: Job Training Provide job training for DC residents seeking careers in the environmental sector, including such fields as environmental science, landscaping and horticulture, lead hazard control, urban salvage and deconstruction, hazard abatement and remediation, and recycling. 629.4 Policy E-5.3.3: Incentives for Green Business Support economic incentives that encourage environmentally sustainable businesses to locate in the District. 629.5 Action E-5.3-A: Voluntary Clean-Up Program Continue the District’s voluntary clean-up program. The program is designed to encourage the investigation and remediation of contamination on any site that is not on the EPA’s National Priority List and that is not the subject of a current clean-up effort. 629.6 Action E-5.3-B: Sustainable Business Initiative Establish a Sustainable Business Initiative, starting with the creation of a committee including representatives from the Board of Trade, the Chamber of Commerce, the DC Building Industry Association, and others. 629.7 Action E-5.3-C: Green Business Certification Establish a green business certification program as an incentive for companies that exemplify sustainable and environmentally responsible business practices. 629.8 Action E-5.3-D: Green Collar Job Corps Explore the feasibility of creating a “green collar” job corps, including education in environmental fields, attraction and retention of green businesses and sustainable industry, and job training and placement 177 within these fields and industries. 629.9 E-5.4 Environmental Program Management 630 The final section of this chapter addresses the administration of environmental policies and programs in the District of Columbia. In the past, the fragmentation of responsibilities across multiple agencies has hindered the enforcement of our environmental regulations and the collection and tracking of environmental data. There has been no single agency with an express mandate to protect the District’s environment and provide environmental leadership. 630.1 As noted in the opening paragraphs of this Element, legislation creating the Department of the Environment was approved in November 2005. Looking forward, a sustained commitment to funding and adequately staffing this department will be necessary to ensure that it can carry out its mission. 630.2 CITYWIDE ELEMENTS COMPREHENSIVE PLAN DISTRICT ELEMENTS ADOPTED 12/19/06 P. 1-168 Policy E-5.4.1: Environmental Planning Create a District administrative structure that allows for the most effective possible means of natural resource planning and management. 630.3 Policy E-5.4.2: Adequacy of Funding Provide for adequate funding and coordination of environmental protection activities and ensure that the environmental impacts of public actions and decisions are fully evaluated. 630.4 Policy E-5.4.3: Cost-Benefit Analysis Ensure that cost estimates for environmental programs consider not only immediate costs but also the long-term value of the benefits that will result. To demonstrate long-term value, fiscal impact assessments should consider the long-term cost of not implementing environmental programs as well as the short-term cost of implementing them. 630.5 Action E-5.4-A: Department of the Environment Provide the necessary staff resources, funding, and regulatory authority for the newly created District Department of the Environment to achieve its mission and successfully implement the District’s key environmental protection programs. 630.6 CITYWIDE ELEMENTS COMPREHENSIVE PLAN DISTRICT ELEMENTS ADOPTED 12/19/06 P. 1-169 CHAPTER 7 ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT ELEMENT Overview 700 The Economic Development Element addresses the future of the District’s economy and the creation of economic opportunity for current and future District residents. It includes strategies to sustain Washington’s major industries, diversify our economy, accommodate job growth, maintain small businesses and neighborhood commercial districts, and increase access to employment for District residents. 700.1 The critical economic development issues facing the District of Columbia are addressed in this Element. These include Defining the District’s role in the national and regional economies Increasing job opportunities for District residents Identifying locations for future job growth Expanding opportunities for small, local, and minority businesses Enhancing and revitalizing the city’s shopping districts Economic development is about more than simply increasing the number of jobs and improving the District’s finances. It is also about fostering good quality jobs with higher wages and better preparing District residents to fill those jobs. It is about spreading the benefits of our strong regional economy more equitably and providing career advancement opportunities for working parents, young adults, and 178 others. Economic development strategies are also critical to improving the quality of life in our neighborhoods, and bringing shopping, restaurants, and basic services to communities that do not have these amenities today. 700.2 In recent decades, the District has faced chronic negative trends that have limited its ability to meet the needs of many residents. These trends include population loss, job decline, high unemployment and poverty rates, fiscal insolvency, and the loss of spending power to the suburbs. Economic indicators also point to growing geographic disparities, with areas in the northwest portion of the city particularly advantaged and areas east of the Anacostia River particularly disadvantaged. While there have been positive signs on many fronts since 2000, the historic east-west divide in the city has only deepened. 700.3 In 1950, the District accounted for nearly 75 percent of the metropolitan area’s employment. By 2000, it accounted for less than 25 percent. While these statistics appear startling, the real story is the growth of the regional economy rather than the decline of the District’s. In fact, the number of jobs in the District has remained fairly constant over the decades. In 1980, there were 666,000 jobs and in 2000, there were about 672,000 jobs. As shown in Figure 7.1, employment in the District did decline from 1990 to 1998, but it has been growing ever since. 700.4 The economic paradoxes of the District of Columbia have been widely documented. The city has more jobs than residents but an unemployment rate that is twice the regional average. Jobs in the District provide some of the highest wages in the country, but over 20 percent of the city’s residents live below the poverty line. The region has the fastest annual job growth rate in the country (2.3 percent yet unemployment in the city is rising. Billions of dollars of income are generated in the District, the majority of which the city is unable to tax because its earners live in other states. 700.6 CITYWIDE ELEMENTS COMPREHENSIVE PLAN DISTRICT ELEMENTS ADOPTED 12/19/06 P. 1-170 [PULLQUOTE: The city has more jobs than residents but an unemployment rate that is twice the regional average. Jobs in the District provide some of the highest wages in the country, but over 20 percent of the city’s residents live below the poverty line. The region has the fastest annual job growth rate in the country (2.3 percent yet unemployment in the city is rising.] [INSERT Figure 7.1 Employment in the District 700.5] Fortunately, some of the negative trends of the past are showing signs of reversal. Between 2000 and 2005, the District captured a much larger share of regional employment growth than it did in the 1980s and 1990s. It is positioned at the center of a regional economy that is strong and growing; total employment in the metropolitan area is approaching 3 million, the highest of any region in the country with a comparably-sized central city. Since 1997, the District has seen significant private-sector employment growth, particularly in high-value industries such as legal services, technology consulting, and similar sectors. It is outperforming the region in legal services and scientific research and development. 700.7 The recent housing boom and increase in property values has increased personal wealth for many longtime District homeowners and substantially enhanced city revenues. Downtown retail has begun to rebound after years of decline, and neighborhood shopping districts like U Street and Barracks Row are 179 thriving again. After decades in which retailers shunned areas east of 16th Street NW, new supermarkets are being developed east of the Anacostia River, national/ brand tenants are arriving in Columbia Heights and a cultural district is emerging along H Street NE. Tourism has rebounded since 2001 and 1,200 hotel rooms are now under construction. 700.9 Over the next twenty years, the District is projected to add 125,000 jobs. The single greatest economic development challenge facing the city will be to link more of these jobs to District residents. This will not only create wealth and opportunity within the city, it will offset commuter traffic, reduce social service expenses, and improve the quality of life for thousands of households. Confronting this challenge successfully will require a multi-pronged strategy to improve our educational system, increase vocational training, strengthen workforce preparedness, and improve the regional transportation network to support job access. 700.10 Economic Development Goal 701 The overarching goal for economic development in the District is as follows: Strengthen the District’s economy by sustaining its core industries, attracting new and diverse industries, accommodating future job growth, fostering the success of small businesses, revitalizing neighborhood commercial centers, improving resident job skills, and helping a greater number of District residents find and keep jobs in the Washington regional economy. 701.1 [PULLQUOTE: Economic Development Goal. The overarching goal for economic development is as follows: Strengthen the District’s economy by sustaining its core industries, attracting new and diverse industries, accommodating future job growth, fostering the success of small businesses, revitalizing neighborhood commercial centers, improving resident job skills, and helping a greater number of District residents find and keep jobs in the Washington regional economy.] CITYWIDE ELEMENTS COMPREHENSIVE PLAN DISTRICT ELEMENTS ADOPTED 12/19/06 P. 1-171 Policies and Actions ED-1.0 Defining Our Economic Future 702 The District economy is underpinned by a handful of “core” industries, including government (particularly federal government education, professional services, administrative support, membership associations, tourism, and health care. These seven sectors account for three-quarters of the jobs in the city and distinguish the District’s economy from the more diverse economies of the surrounding region and nation. Economic development strategies must explore ways to sustain these industries while leveraging them to attract new businesses and jobs. Diversifying the economic base can expand job opportunities for residents and can help the District fare better during economic downturns. 702.1 The city’s economy is dominated by the government sector. More than one-third of the jobs in the city are public sector jobs, with the federal government accounting for approximately 28 percent of total employment and local government jobs with District of Columbia agencies accounting for approximately five percent. The government is also directly or indirectly responsible for many of the District’s private sector jobs. This has always been the case in Washington, but has become even more so since the 180 federal downsizing of the 1990s. As government employment declined during the 1990s, private employment growth was fueled by government outsourcing and contracting. 702.2 Table 7.1 shows the District’s top 20 private industry sectors in 2004 using 3-digit NAICS codes. These 20 industries represent 57 percent of all jobs in the city, and 87 percent of the private sector jobs. 702.3 The District’s largest private sector industry—accounting for more than one in five private sector jobs—is Professional and Technical Services. This category includes lawyers, architects, engineers, and consultants. The second largest category, Membership Associations and Organizations, includes the many industry, trade, and interest groups in the city. Close behind are Administrative and Support Services, which include all manner of services supporting the office sector, from secretaries to janitors. Other key sectors are Educational Services (8.3 and Hospitals (5.2 The tourism “cluster” includes Food Services and Drinking Places, and Accommodation, which together account for over 10 percent of private sector employment. 702.5 The number of jobs in the District has been growing at the rate of about one percent a year since 2000, with a net gain of 32,000 jobs between 2000 and 2005. According to the District Department of Employment Services, and research organizations like the Center for Regional Analysis at George Mason University, this rate of growth will continue for the next 10 years. About 7,000 new jobs a year are anticipated through 2015. Beyond 2015, the pace is expected to slow to about 5,000 new jobs a year. Based on available data, nearly all sectors of the economy are projected to grow during the next decade. 702.6 CITYWIDE ELEMENTS COMPREHENSIVE PLAN DISTRICT ELEMENTS ADOPTED 12/19/06 P. 1-172 Table 7.1: 20 Largest Private Sector Industries in the District of Columbia, 2004 3-digit Industry Employment Percent of Private Percent of Public Private* NAICS 541 Professional and technical services 93,841 21.9% 14.4% NAICS 813 Membership associations and organizations 44,078 10.3% 6.7% NAICS 561 Administrative and support services 41,415 9.6% 6.3% NAICS 611 Educational services 35,798 8.3% 5.5% NAICS 722 Food services and drinking places 30,483 7.1% 4.7% NAICS 622 Hospitals 22,466 5.2% 3.4% NAICS 721 Accommodation 14,795 3.4% 2.3% NAICS 624 Social assistance 10,696 2.5% 1.6% NAICS 621 Ambulatory health care services 10,215 2.4% 1.6% NAICS 531 Real estate 9,301 2.2% 1.4% NAICS 511 Publishing industries, except Internet 9,180 2.1% 1.4% NAICS 522 Credit intermediation and related activities 8,529 2.0% 1.3% NAICS 623 Nursing and residential care facilities 7,372 1.7% 1.1% NAICS 999 Unclassified 6,106 1.4% 0.9% NAICS 238 Specialty trade contractors 5,963 1.4% 0.9% NAICS 812 Personal and laundry services 5,915 1.4% 0.9% NAICS 445 Food and beverage stores 5,483 1.3% 0.8% NAICS 236 Construction of buildings 4,512 1.1% 0.7% NAICS 515 Broadcasting, except Internet 4,374 1.0% 0.7% NAICS 814 Private households 4,315 1.0% 0.7% All other private sector jobs 54,339 12.7 Total Private Employment 429,176 100.0% 65.7% Source: U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, Covered Employment and Wages (CEW) series; DC DOES, Current Employment Survey (CES) Series NAICS North American Industry Classification System Note: Total retail employment (which is composed of several NAICS industries) is estimated at 17,500. 181 ED-1.1 Stabilizing and Diversifying Our Economic Base 703 The District can do more to leverage the strengths of its economy and the region’s skilled and highly educated labor force. It already has an enviable mix of assets that include the national capital, highperforming industries, numerous colleges and universities, amenity-rich neighborhoods, and a transportation system that links the entire metropolitan region. To increase its competitiveness within the regional economy, the District will need to further diversify its economy in sectors that have growth potential and/or are underperforming. 703.1 [PULLQUOTE: The District has an enviable mix of assets that include the national capital, highperforming industries, numerous colleges and universities, amenity-rich neighborhoods, and a transportation system that links the entire metropolitan region.] CITYWIDE ELEMENTS COMPREHENSIVE PLAN DISTRICT ELEMENTS ADOPTED 12/19/06 P. 1-173 Several industries that do not appear in Table 7.1 may become more important to the District’s economy in the future. For example, the District has a burgeoning “knowledge” economy comprised of universities, think tanks, broadcasting, publishing, Internet media, and data processing firms. The District is already outperforming the region in many of these industries and it can and should do more to enhance their competitiveness in the future. Expanding knowledge-based industries can position the District to capture a larger share of federal “spin-off” benefits, particularly given its already strong competitive edge in the technology sectors. 703.2 The District is also a center of international business. The foreign missions and offices of global economic organizations such as the World Bank Group and the IMF represent a major economic sector in their own right with a cumulative direct economic impact in the region of over a billion dollars, and much more in terms of contracting. More importantly, the concentration of missions and institutions makes the District a unique place to conduct business for companies engaging in international investment or transactions. 703.3 Tables 7.2 and 7.3 provide some indication of where the District’s economy may be headed. Between 1999 and 2004, Computer Systems Design and Related Services exceeded all other sectors of the economy in both the amount and rate of growth. The industry is expected to be among the fastest growing sectors of the local economy in the future. Legal services and restaurants, also leaders during the past five years, are poised for significant gains. 703.4 The 15 industries listed in Table 7.3 represent more than half of the job growth expected in the city during the 10-year period between 2002 and 2012. Some of the gains reflect continued growth of core industries like the federal government, universities, hotels, and non-profits. Other gains are in emerging sectors which show promise for even greater expansion in the future. 703.5 Based on regional and national economic data and indicators, opportunities exist to more aggressively market the District as a corporate headquarters location, grow the building trade and construction industries, and expand information-based industries such as broadcast media. There are also untapped opportunities to grow “backward-linked” or supply industries, such as the laundry and catering firms that serve the city’s hotels, and “forward-linked” or supplied industries, such as the technology firms that benefit from local university research. The District’s retail sector also holds the potential for 182 significant job growth. 703.8 [PULLQUOTE: Based on regional and national economic data and indicators, opportunities exist to more aggressively market the District as a corporate headquarters location, grow the building trade and construction industries, and expand information-based industries such as broadcast media.] CITYWIDE ELEMENTS COMPREHENSIVE PLAN DISTRICT ELEMENTS ADOPTED 12/19/06 P. 1-174 Table 7.2: High Growth Industries, District of Columbia, 1999-2004 703.8 Total Jobs Employment Change (000s) NAICS Sector Industry 1999 2004 Absolute APGR* Five 4-digit industries with greatest employment growth 5415 Computer Systems Design and Related Services 7,700 14,700 7,000 13.81% 8133 Social Advocacy Organizations 5,400 9,500 4,100 11.96% 5411 Legal Services 31,500 34,600 3,100 1.90% 7221 Full-Service Restaurants 12,500 15,200 2,700 3.99% 7222 Limited-Service Eating Places 7,400 9,600 2,200 5.34% Source: Department of Employment Services Office of Labor Market Research and Information in cooperation with the Virginia Employment Commission, the Maryland Department of Labor, Licensing and Regulation, the West Virginia Bureau of Employment Programs and the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics APGR Annualized Percent Growth Rate Table 7.3: Top 15 Projected High Growth Industries, District of Columbia, 2002-2012 703.7 NAICS Industry Title Employment Growth 813 Religious, Grantmaking, Civic, Professional, and Similar Organizations 5,789 91 Federal Government 5,596 5415 Computer Systems Design and Related Services 4,713 6113 Colleges, Universities, and Professional Schools 4,460 5411 Legal Services 4,125 722 Food Services and Drinking Places 3,219 61 Self-Employed Workers, Primary Job 3,180 5416 Management, Scientific, and Technical Consulting Services 2,671 5617 Services to Buildings and Dwellings 2,480 721 Accommodation 2,396 611 Elementary and Secondary Schools 2,326 5613 Employment Services 1,910 624 Social Assistance 1,833 5413 Architectural, Engineering, and Related Services 1,786 5417 Scientific Research and Development Services 1,759 Source: District of Columbia Department of Employment Services (2005 District of Columbia Employment Projections by Industry and Occupation, 2002  2012.

This will require continued government support and incentives for economic development programs, government participation in local economic development projects and initiatives, and strengthened capacity among local economic development organizations, community development corporations, and workforce development groups. 703.12 Policy ED-1.1.5: Use of Large Sites Plan strategically for the District’s remaining large development sites to ensure that their economic development potential is fully realized. These sites should be viewed as assets that can be used to revitalize neighborhoods and diversify the District economy over the long term. Sites with Metrorail access, planned light rail access, and highway access should be viewed as opportunities for new jobs and not exclusively as housing sites. 703.13 Action ED-1.1-A: Economic Development Strategic Plan Prepare an Economic Development Strategic Plan that lays out in greater detail the steps the District must pursue to maintain and grow its economy. This plan should cover all economic sectors, evaluate competitiveness, and include strategies for workforce development and business attraction and retention. It should be developed through broad input from stakeholders, including resident, industry and education interests. 703.14 Action ED-1.1-B: Data Tracking Maintain and regularly update statistical data on employment in core sectors, wages and salaries, forecasts by sector, and opportunities for future employment growth. 703.15 ED-1.2 Sustaining the Federal Presence 704 Although the number of federal jobs declined between 1990 and 1998, retaining and even increasing federal employment should be an important part of the city’s economic development agenda. Not only does the federal government buffer the District’s economy from cyclical boom and bust cycles, it generates significant private employment. 704.1 The District’s status as the nation’s capital and seat of the United States government is intrinsic to the local economy. The federal government employs 191,900 workers in the District, and federal activities account for almost 35 percent of the region’s economic output. It accounts for one in every 3.5 jobs in the District. The continued presence of the federal government and related uses is a key source of the CITYWIDE ELEMENTS COMPREHENSIVE PLAN DISTRICT ELEMENTS ADOPTED 12/19/06 P. 1-176 District’s preeminence in the region. Supporting this presence is important to maintain the District’s central position in the metropolitan economy. 704.2 Decentralization of federal jobs from the city has been a concern since the 1950s. The combination of interstate highways, suburbanization of the workforce, lack of available land, and national security issues resulted in the relocation of many federal offices to Maryland and Virginia in the 1950s and 1960s. Despite the government’s continued strong presence in the District, its “60/40 rule” regarding federal employment (see text box) has functioned more as a guiding policy than a strict mandate. 704.3 Looking forward, the District should continue to retain as much federal employment as it can. Federal jobs have historically provided tremendous job opportunities for District residents, ranging from entry level and clerical jobs to advanced managerial and highly skilled positions. 704.4 Even greater opportunities lie in federal procurement. As shown in Figure 7.2, procurement in the metropolitan region surpassed direct federal spending on wages in the mid-1990s, and has continued 184 to grow more rapidly than other categories of federal spending ever since. A substantial amount of procurement spending—more than $11 billion in 2003—already occurs within the District, as shown in Table 7.4. 704.5 More concerted and strategic efforts should be made to capture contract services in the future, leveraging the District’s already strong presence in computer systems design; engineering; and management, scientific, and technical consulting services. 704.6 [BEGIN SIDEBAR] The “60/40” Rule 704.7 The 60/40 rule refers to a federal guideline on the distribution of federal jobs within the Washington Metropolitan Area. The rule was first established in the 1968 Comprehensive Plan as a symbolic commitment to retain the District of Columbia as the seat of the federal government during a period when many jobs and residents were leaving the city for the suburbs. A goal was set to retain at least 60 percent of the region’s federal jobs within the District, and thus allow no more than 40 percent of the federal jobs to locate in the Washington suburbs. The 60/40 rule remains an important guiding principle behind federal location decisions. However, it has functioned as a guideline rather than an absolute standard. The actual regional share of federal jobs dropped below 60 percent in the 1970s and currently stands at about 53 percent. Pressure to relocate federal jobs to the suburbs continues to be strong due to factors such as security, congestion, housing costs, and a desire to be closer to the suburban workforce.

The city already has a dynamic learning and research environment, a thriving arts and creative scene, quality work spaces, and a proven record of attracting such firms and employees. These industries can add significant value to the city’s economy, and can support a range of opportunities for employment and career advancement. They also offer relatively high wages and flexible working conditions. 705.1 [PULLQUOTE: The District is uniquely positioned to grow those industries that rely on access to cutting-edge technology and that specialize in a range of services such as information exchange, design, and media.] As noted earlier in this chapter, the District has a budding technology sector, as demonstrated by robust employment growth in several technology-intensive industries. The District also has employment concentrations in broadcasting, Internet-related services, data processing, and information services, such as libraries and syndicates. The District’s technology sector is related in part to the presence of the national capital and also to the presence of colleges and universities. The federal presence supports extensive research and development activities through laboratories such as the National Institute of Health. The universities often host cutting-edge research and development that in turn may spawn successful firms, often founded by student entrepreneurs. 705.2 Particular research fields with strong ties to the District include information technology, clinical 186 research, and economics. These are all uses that can take advantage of the District’s predominant commercial development type—multi-tenant, Metro-accessible office buildings. On the other hand, capturing biotechnology and research labs may be more difficult. While the District has the right elements for these uses, including universities, funding sources, and a highly educated regional labor pool, they typically prefer less costly rents in a campus-like setting. A handful of large sites in the city offer this setting, but there is competition to use these properties for other uses such as housing and federal office space. 705.3 [Photo Caption: Enhancing partnerships with universities and other institutions generates business and employment growth in the research and development sectors.] Rounding out the “knowledge economy” cluster are the cutting-edge arts, design, media, information, Internet, and entertainment industries. For example, the District already has the nation’s second largest video game design industry in the country. The District should do more to capitalize on its potential as a global information, research, and data center. As the generator of much of the nation’s news, the District should also take advantage of the success of established broadcast media such as CNN, BET, and XM Satellite Radio and accommodate not only radio and television, but also production and post- production facilities.

Similarly, the District should continue to foster designdriven industries, along with creative destinations that rely on cutting-edge technology such as the Spy Museum and Newseum. 705.4 Policy ED-1.3.1: Technology-Intensive Industries Aggressively pursue technology-based and creative industries, such as computer systems design, information services, data processing, and broadcasting firms. Promote the development of space that is attractive to these firms, both in new and existing buildings. Such space should include relatively lowercost, large floor plate buildings with high load-bearing capacity and good access to transportation. 705.5 Policy ED-1.3.2: University Partnerships Enhance partnerships with universities and other institutions to generate business and employment growth in the research and development sectors, and to continue technology transfer programs for District businesses and entrepreneurs. 705.6 Policy ED-1.3.3: Media and Design Capitalize on the success of established broadcast media and design companies by continuing to grow these industries, and by growing related industries such as web design and multimedia content. 705.7 Policy ED-1.3.4: Incentives Provide incentives, marketing efforts, and zoning tools to attract and retain “knowledge cluster” and creative industries. Take full advantage of federal incentives, such as research and development tax credits, to attract such firms. 705.8 Policy ED-1.3.5: Technology Infrastructure Focus technology attraction efforts on sites and corridors where technology infrastructure (such as fiber optics cable) is already in place. Proximity to such infrastructure provides an advantage for firms that rely on the movement of large amounts of data. The capacity and need for such infrastructure should be 187 considered when planning for the redevelopment of strategic corridors, such as New York Avenue. 705.9 Action ED-1.3-A: Knowledge Cluster Action Strategy Conduct a more detailed assessment of the knowledge cluster in the District. Such a study should be guided by a Task Force that represents economic development organizations, private industry, residents, and research institutions. It should include a review of national best practices, as well as actions to promote the development of research-driven and creative firms in the District. 705.10 Action ED-1.3-B: Branding Washington as a Creative Hub Develop a marketing and branding campaign that establishes a stronger identity for the District of Columbia as a center for creativity and innovation, capitalizing on established institutions such as the city’s museums, think tanks, arts establishments, universities, and media industries. 705.11 Action ED-1.3-C: Technology in NoMA and the Near Southeast Identify opportunities for knowledge- and technology-based industries within the emerging business districts of North-of-Massachusetts Avenue (NoMA) and the Near Southeast. 705.12 See also the Arts and Culture Element for policies on attracting and retaining a creative workforce, and the Educational Facilities Element for policies and actions on educational partnerships. CITYWIDE ELEMENTS COMPREHENSIVE PLAN DISTRICT ELEMENTS ADOPTED 12/19/06 P. 1-180 ED-2.0 The Spatial Impacts of the Job Market 706 The addition of 125,000 jobs during the next 20 years will create the demand for office, retail, hospitality, institutional, and industrial space. Estimates of floor space needs for the 20-year period vary from around 35 million to 65 million square feet, depending on the mix of jobs and space utilization trends. Several hundred acres of land will be required to sustain this development, in a variety of settings with a variety of building types. Accommodating this growth will pose a challenge for the District, given that it is a mature city with fixed boundaries. 706.1 Different sectors of the economy will generate the demand for different types of space. The federal government, professional/ technical services, and member associations will drive the demand for office space, especially in Central Washington. The education and hospital sectors will drive demand for institutional space, typically on campuses or in campus-like settings. Such settings may also be attractive to growth industries such as those in technology and design. Administrative and support services will generate demand for light industrial (also called office/flex) space, and the tourism sector will rely on retail, hotel, and cultural space in Central Washington and elsewhere. 706.2 The following sections of the Economic Development Element explore the impact of projected job growth on each of these market segments. The policies and actions are intended to accommodate longterm economic growth needs by coordinating land use and transportation decisions and maximizing access to employment for District residents. These policies are supplemented by the job training and development policies that appear later in this Element, and by the commercial and industrial land use policies in the Land Use Element. 706.3 [Photo Caption: The federal government, professional/ technical services, and member associations will drive the demand for office space, especially Downtown and on the Downtown perimeter.] ED-2.1 The Office Economy 707 The District has one of the largest inventories of office space in the nation, with over 112 million square feet. Among American cities, only Midtown Manhattan, Lower Manhattan, and Downtown Chicago boast a greater concentration of office buildings. By most indicators, the District’s office market is performing well. Its vacancy rate is just 6.7 percent, the lowest of any major U.S. market. The average asking rent remains above $45 per square foot—second only to Midtown Manhattan. 707.1 188 [PULLQUOTE: By most indicators, the District’s office market is performing well. Its vacancy rate is just 6.7 percent, the lowest of any major U.S. market. The average asking rent remains above $45 per square foot—second only to Midtown Manhattan.] Central Washington includes a number of sub-markets, each providing different amenities and locational advantages. The largest of these sub-markets are Downtown, traditionally defined as the area east of 16th Street and south of Massachusetts Avenue; and the Golden Triangle, extending from 16th Street west to Foggy Bottom and north to Dupont Circle. Smaller office districts exist in Georgetown, on Capitol Hill, along the avenues of Upper Northwest Washington, around L’Enfant Plaza, and in the Southeast Federal Center and North Capitol Street areas. The large geographic expanse of the city’s office market has been driven at least partially by height limits and the sizeable area dedicated to federal uses and open space in the heart of the city. 707.2 The city’s more well-established business districts, such as Downtown and the Golden Triangle, are approaching build-out. As a result, development is pushing east towards Union Station and the North-of- CITYWIDE ELEMENTS COMPREHENSIVE PLAN DISTRICT ELEMENTS ADOPTED 12/19/06 P. 1-181 Massachusetts-Avenue (NoMA) areas, and south toward the Anacostia River. Almost nine million square feet of office space is now under construction in the city, much of it in these areas. 707.3 Although the District’s commercial land supply is adequate to accommodate the job forecasts, the market faces a number of challenges to its continued high performance. While absorption has been brisk (about 1.75 million square feet per year approximately half of the space due to come online in the coming years is speculative. In addition, recent federal security standards and related military base closures may open up large quantities of inexpensive office space in Arlington, potentially impacting the demand for space in the District (see “Planning for BRAC” text box At the same time, some of the existing space in Central Washington has reached the end of its economic life and is in need of renovation or replacement. Going forward, there will be a need for strategies to retain existing office tenants and to attract new tenants through creative marketing. 707.4 Policy ED-2.1.1: Office Growth Plan for an office sector that will continue to accommodate growth in government, government contractors, legal services, international business, trade associations, and other service-sector office industries. The primary location for this growth should be in Central Washington and in the emerging office centers along South Capitol Street and the Anacostia Waterfront. 707.5 Policy ED-2.1.2: Corporate Headquarters Promote the qualities that favor the District as a headquarters or branch setting for multi-national corporations, including its economic, social, political and locational attributes. Focus in particular on companies that contract with the federal government but are currently headquartered elsewhere. Construct incentive packages to encourage large corporations to locate and maintain their offices in the District. 707.6 Policy ED-2.1.3: Signature Office Buildings Emphasize opportunities for build-to-suit/signature office buildings in order to accommodate high- 189 end tenants and users and corporate headquarters. Consider sites in secondary office centers such as NoMA and the Near Southeast for this type of development. 707.7 Policy ED-2.1.4: Diversified Office Options Diversify the tenant base by attracting both high-end, mid-range, and low-end office space users, and by supporting a range of office space types. Recognize that while many firms seek to be located in the District, some may prefer lower-end space over premium Downtown office space. 707.8 Policy ED-2.1.5: Infill and Renovation Support the continued growth of the office sector through infill and renovation within established commercial districts to more efficiently use available space while providing additional opportunities for new space. 707.9 Policy ED-2.1.6: Local-Serving Office Space Encourage the development of small local-serving offices within neighborhood commercial districts throughout the city to provide relatively affordable locations for small businesses and local services (such as real estate and insurance offices, accountants, consultants, and medical offices 707.10 Action ED-2.1-A: Office Sector Assessment Conduct a comprehensive evaluation of the District’s office market at least once every two years, including employment forecasts; space demand estimates; inventories of planned and proposed projects; analysis of location trends; analysis of regional competition including taxes, amenities, and the regulatory environment; and shifts in occupant needs.

The Department of Defense periodically reorganizes America’s military infrastructure to more effectively and efficiently support its operations. This may result in the redeployment of personnel to new sites, the development of new facilities, and the closure of military bases across the United States. The latest round of base closings, announced in 2005, would close Walter Reed Naval Hospital and scale back operations at Washington Navy Yard and Bolling Air Force Base. According to the George Mason School of Public Policy's Center for Regional Analysis, the District could lose more than 7,500 military and civilian jobs as a result. The indirect impacts of the BRAC may be even greater than the direct impacts. Specifically, new Department of Defense security standards may result in the vacating of almost 7.2 million square feet of space in Arlington and Alexandria. As contractors and federal tenants leave this space for secured facilities at Fort Belvoir and elsewhere, the local office market may quickly become saturated. Possible impacts on the District could be a downward adjustment in office rents and leasing rates, an increase in vacancy rates, and the loss of firms to Virginia as cheaper space becomes available. In the long-term, there may also be positive impacts of the military realignment. The possibility of future land transfers from federal ownership to the District could mean new economic development 190 opportunities for the city. [END SIDEBAR] Action ED-2.1-B: Marketing Programs Prepare and implement a marketing plan for the District of Columbia’s office space, working collaboratively with local economic development organizations such as the Board of Trade and Chamber of Commerce. The marketing plan should focus on companies that are headquartered elsewhere but conduct extensive business with the federal government, including legal firms, national membership organizations and technology-intensive industries, and the domestic offices of international firms. 707.13 Action ED-2.1-C: Back Office Construction Incentives Explore the feasibility of financial and/or regulatory incentives to encourage the development of lowercost office space and office space for small and/or non-profit businesses in underinvested areas and in commercial districts outside Downtown. 707.14 ED-2.2 The Retail Economy 708 A robust retail sector has the potential to generate significant tax revenue, provide employment and income for residents, enhance the vitality of the city, and improve shopping, dining, and entertainment choices for District neighborhoods. In recent years, the range of retail options in the city has been increasing. Gallery Place and U Street have become major shopping, entertainment, and dining destinations, drawing a mix of tourists, workers and residents. Established retail districts such as Friendship Heights, Georgetown, and Adams Morgan continue to draw patrons from outside as well as inside the city. Retail is also returning to the city’s eastern quadrants, including locations like Anacostia Gateway and Barracks Row, after years of decline. 708.1 CITYWIDE ELEMENTS COMPREHENSIVE PLAN DISTRICT ELEMENTS ADOPTED 12/19/06 P. 1-183 Nonetheless, the District still loses, or “leaks,” an estimated $1 billion per year in retail spending from its resident population, amounting to almost $4,000 per household. The leakage is even higher when the potential spending of the daytime population, including workers and visitors, is included. The District’s underperforming retail sector has a pronounced impact on its fiscal health, since retailing pays both real property taxes and sales taxes, and is more also likely to employ District residents than office development (see text box on retail sales on P. 7.16 708.2 Efforts are underway to expand retail choices and strengthen existing retail businesses, both in Central Washington and in District neighborhoods. Continued planning and market assessment will be needed to ensure that the District is targeting an optimal mix of goods and services, and in the right locations. An effective retail strategy should include a focus on those uses that are missing or under-represented today, such as grocery stores, home furnishings, and home improvement stores. It should also assess the potential for new retail formats, such as “vertical” car dealerships that make more efficient use of limited and expensive land. If the full market potential of retail is tapped, as much as seven to ten million square feet of floor space might be accommodated in the next 20 years. 708.3 [Photo Caption: Gallery Place has become a major shopping, entertainment, and dining destination, drawing a mix of tourists, workers, and residents.] [BEGIN TEXT BOX] The Importance of Retail Sales to the District’s Finances 708.4 An analysis of the fiscal impacts of different land uses was performed as part of the revision of the Comprehensive Plan to better understand the implications of future land use decisions. This analysis 191 found that retail floor space generated more tax revenue for the city than comparable amounts of housing or office space. In fact, 100 square feet of “typical” retail space generated $1,995 of revenue annually, compared to $1,246 for office space, and $869 for market-rate condominiums. For a “typical” marketrate condominium, 70 percent of the municipal revenues generated were from income taxes and 25 percent were from property taxes. By contrast, almost three-quarters of the municipal revenue derived from retail space was from sales tax. The analysis found that mixed use development may be more favorable than single-use development from a revenue standpoint. Combining retail and residential uses allows the District to capture sales taxes, income taxes, and property taxes, while also reducing retail “leakage” and providing housing for the local workforce. Likewise, retail in tandem with office development provides an opportunity to capture worker spending on retail sales, currently a missed opportunity in many parts of Downtown. Some caveats to this analysis are worth noting: Although retail uses are the best generator of revenue, this is dependent on the health of the economy and the specific mix of retail businesses. Some types of retail clearly generate more sales tax revenue per square foot than others. Office uses are the most reliable generator of revenue since a higher proportion of the revenue comes from property taxes, which fluctuate less than income and sales taxes. The fiscal impacts of residential uses are highly sensitive to the income levels and household characteristics of occupants. For example, a market rate housing unit occupied by two income earners with no children generates more revenue and requires fewer municipal expenses than an affordable family unit. While fiscal impacts alone should not drive land use decisions, this type of data can help the city create balance, and achieve an appropriate mix of uses and activities as it grows. CITYWIDE ELEMENTS COMPREHENSIVE PLAN DISTRICT ELEMENTS ADOPTED 12/19/06 P. 1-184 [END TEXT BOX] Policy ED-2.2.1: Expanding the Retail Sector Pursue a retail strategy that will allow the District to fully capitalize on the spending power of residents, workers and visitors, and that will meet the retail needs of underserved areas. 708.5 Policy ED-2.2.2: Downtown Shopping Strengthen Downtown Washington as a regional retail destination in order to capitalize on its status as a transit hub and its historic role as the cross-roads and central marketplace for the Washington metropolitan area. Downtown should be developed and promoted as a regional retail destination of choice, with multiple traditional and non-traditional retail anchors, a well-programmed variety of consumer goods retailers, specialty shops, retailers unique to the Washington region, and a wide variety of restaurants and entertainment venues. 708.6 Policy ED-2.2.3: Neighborhood Shopping Create additional shopping opportunities in Washington’s neighborhood commercial districts to better meet the demand for basic goods and services. Reuse of vacant buildings in these districts should be encouraged, along with appropriately-scaled retail infill development on vacant and underutilized sites. Promote the creation of locally-owned, non-chain establishments because of their role in creating unique 192 shopping experiences. 708.7 Policy ED-2.2.4: Destination Retailing Continue to encourage “destination” retail districts that specialize in unique goods and services, such as furniture districts, arts districts, high-end specialty shopping districts, and wholesale markets. Support the creative efforts of local entrepreneurs who seek to enhance the District’s destination retailing base. 708.8 Policy ED-2.2.5: Business Mix Reinforce existing and encourage new retail districts by attracting a mix of nationally-recognized chains as well as locally-based chains and smaller specialty stores to the city’s shopping districts. 708.9 Policy ED-2.2.6: Grocery Stores and Supermarkets Promote the development of new grocery stores and supermarkets, particularly in neighborhoods where residents currently travel long distances for food and other shopping services. Because such uses inherently require greater depth and lot area than is present in many commercial districts, adjustments to current zoning standards to accommodate these uses should be considered. 708.10 Policy ED-2.2.7: Planning For Retail Coordinate neighborhood planning efforts with the District’s economic development planning and implementation programs in order to improve retail offerings in local commercial centers. 708.11 Action ED-2.2-A: Retail Action Agenda Prepare and implement a citywide Retail Action Agenda. The Agenda should include an evaluation of the current and projected amount of market-supportable retail, strategies for overcoming retail development barriers, neighborhood-specific evaluations, and recommendations for new retail development and assistance programs. 708.12 Action ED-2.2-B: Retail Ceiling Heights Determine the feasibility of zoning amendments which would permit higher ground floor retail ceiling heights in commercial and mixed use districts.

[Photo Caption: Grocery stores and supermarkets should be developed in neighborhoods where residents currently travel long distances for food and other shopping services] ED-2.3 The Tourism and Hospitality Economy 709 The District is a premier tourism, convention and special events destination. Its array of attractions and cultural venues, particularly the national museums and federal monuments, rivals that of other great cities around the globe. With 19 million annual visitors, the District ranks fourth among the top United States destinations for domestic travelers and eighth among foreign visitors. Away from the National Mall, an increasingly rich and diverse set of visitor amenities has been developed, including theaters, galleries, restaurants, night clubs, historic trails, and historic home museums, which are enjoyed by visitors and residents alike. Added to this are the District’s newly expanded convention facilities and the associated increase in convention travel. 709.1 The economic impact of tourism includes both direct employment in the hospitality industry and spending by tourists and business travelers during their stays in the District. Hotels, bars, and restaurants directly 193 provide more than 45,000 jobs in the city. The Washington Convention Center alone is estimated to have generated more than $700 million in direct spending by attendees in 2005. New hotels such as the 400- room Mandarin Oriental in Southwest have added to the lodging choices in the District. Additional hotels, including a new Convention Center headquarters hotel, are planned to attract larger conventions. 709.2 [PULLQUOTE: The economic impact of tourism includes both direct employment in the hospitality industry and spending by tourists and business travelers during their stays in the District. The Washington Convention Center alone is estimated to have generated more than $700 million in direct spending by attendees in 2005.] Future growth is expected in both the tourism and convention sectors, with strong job gains projected during the next five years. The opening of new attractions such as the renovated National Portrait Gallery and the US Capitol Visitors Center will attract new visitors and also bring repeat visitors back to the capital. The new ballpark, scheduled to open in 2008, will have a particularly strong impact on visitor spending. In addition, features such as the African-American Heritage Trail, the Fort Circle Parks, the National Arboretum, Kenilworth Aquatic Gardens, and the Frederick Douglass Home offer an opportunity to explore the city “beyond the monuments” while also supporting neighborhood businesses and a better understanding of the city’s history and culture among visitors. 709.3 Meeting the increased demand for visitor services will require sustained efforts to improve the hospitality workforce, upgrade transportation capacity, address public concerns about security, and maintain public access to key attractions and amenities. It will also require proactive measures to address neighborhood concerns about tour buses, parking, and other tourism impacts. 709.4 Policy ED-2.3.1: Growing the Hospitality Industry Develop an increasingly robust tourism and convention industry, which is underpinned by a broad base of arts, entertainment, restaurant, lodging, cultural and government amenities. Strive to increase a) the total number of visitors to Washington b) the number of visitors staying in the District (rather than in suburban hotels and (c) longer visitor stays in Washington. Promote the District not only as the preferred base for exploring the city’s attractions but also the preferred overnight base for visiting regional attractions. 709.5 CITYWIDE ELEMENTS COMPREHENSIVE PLAN DISTRICT ELEMENTS ADOPTED 12/19/06 P. 1-186 Policy ED-2.3.2: Visitor Attractions Provide new and enhanced visitor attractions and entertainment venues in the District, particularly attractions that complement the traditional museums and monuments and draw more international visitors and young adults to the city. New attractions should create a clear identity for the District as the region’s major entertainment center. 709.6 Policy ED-2.3.3: Amenities Beyond the Mall Promote the development of cultural amenities beyond the Mall in an effort to more fully capitalize on the economic benefits of tourism. 709.7 See also the Arts and Culture Element for policies on promotion of the visual and performing arts, and the Historic Preservation Element for policies on heritage tourism. Policy ED-2.3.4: Lodging and Accommodation 194 Support the development of a diverse range of hotel types, serving travelers with varying needs, tastes, and budgets. New hotels should be encouraged both within Central Washington and in outlying commercial areas of the city, particularly in areas which presently lack quality accommodation. 709.8 Policy ED-2.3.5: Federal Coordination Continue to work with federal entities in the planning of visitor attractions, including new federal monuments and memorials, so that the District can plan for complementary amenities and incorporate these features into its marketing programs. The District should also coordinate with the federal government to address security measures which may affect the accessibility and appearance of visitor attractions. 709.9 Policy ED-2.3.6: Entertainment Districts Support the continued concentration of entertainment uses in the Gallery Place/ Convention Center area to create a stronger and more visible destination for visitors, workers, and residents, and to avoid the overconcentration of these uses in neighborhoods where they might have adverse impacts. Improve streetscape and transportation connections between this area and the National Mall to foster its continued success. 709.10 Policy ED-2.3.7: Visitor Information Services Provide more effective visitor information services, including information on tourist attractions and services, and transportation, lodging, dining, cultural and entertainment options. 709.11 See the Transportation Element for additional guidance on improved signage to attractions and destinations within the District. Policy ED-2.3.8: Spin-Off Industries Promote the development of hospitality-supply industries within the District to capture a greater share of the employment and income benefits associated with this labor-intensive sector. Presently, many of the industries that provide supplies to local hotels and restaurants are located outside of the city. 709.12 Policy ED-2.3.9: Hospitality Workforce Development Recognize the potential for the hospitality sector to generate entry level jobs and opportunities for upward mobility for District residents by promoting vocational, job training, and job placement initiatives in this sector, and by working with local hotels, the District of Columbia Hotel Association, the Washington Convention and Tourism Corporation, and others. 709.13 CITYWIDE ELEMENTS COMPREHENSIVE PLAN DISTRICT ELEMENTS ADOPTED 12/19/06 P. 1-187 Action ED-2.3-A: Assessment of Supply Industries Conduct an assessment of the industries that provide goods and services to the District hotels and restaurants, such as caterers, laundries, and janitorial services. Based on the findings of the assessment, consider incentives and regulatory tools which might help the District capture a larger share of these businesses, along with possible locations for such uses within the city. 709.14 Action ED-2.3-B: Promote Unique Assets Investigate opportunities for further promotion of Washington’s more esoteric attractions so that visitors may be drawn to new destinations in the city, thereby extending their stays and creating more economic benefits for the city. For example, consider tour packages that include “Undercover Washington” (featuring the FBI Building, Watergate, the Spy Museum, etc “Naturalist’s Washington” (featuring the C &amp;amp; O Canal, Dumbarton Gardens, the Anacostia River, Rock Creek Park, and the National Arboretum) and “Washington at War” (featuring the Fort Circle Parks, Marine Corps Historical Museum, and the war 195 memorials Consider also a permanent fair or series of destinations showcasing the 50 states that draws on the District’s status as the nation’s capital. 709.15 Action ED-2.3-C: Ballpark Economic Strategy Develop a strategic plan to capitalize on the economic opportunities of the new Major League Baseball park, including the development of additional restaurants, entertainment, and hospitality services in the ballpark vicinity. 709.16 See the Arts and Culture Element for additional actions relating to tourism ED-2.4 The Institutional Economy 710 The District’s institutions, including colleges, universities, and hospitals, make a significant contribution to the local economy. As of 2004, Colleges, Universities and Professional Schools accounted for 30,500 jobs in the District, representing nearly five percent of total employment. Of the District’s top 20 private employers, the District’s Department of Employment Services reports that universities occupy the number one, two, four, nine, and 12 slots. George Washington University is the largest private employer in the city, followed by Georgetown. Employment at colleges and universities in the District peaked in 1999, declined for the next two years, and has been on the rise since. The District Department of Employment Services indicates this sector will gain about 4,500 jobs between 2002 and 2012. 710.1 [Photo Caption: The District’s institutions, including colleges, universities, and hospitals, make a significant contribution to the local economy.

These include Washington Hospital Center (a private teaching hospital affiliated with several DC universities Georgetown University Hospital/Medstar Health, Howard University Hospital, and the George Washington University Hospital. These four institutions are the third, seventh, eighth, and 15th largest private employers in the District. Hospitals accounted for approximately 22,500 jobs in 2004, representing 3.4 percent of private sector employment. 710.2 Policy ED-2.4.1: Institutional Growth Support growth in the higher education and health care sectors. Recognize the potential of these industries to provide employment and income opportunities for District residents, and to enhance the District’s array of cultural amenities and health care options. 710.3 See also the Educational Facilities Element for additional policies related to colleges and universities. CITYWIDE ELEMENTS COMPREHENSIVE PLAN DISTRICT ELEMENTS ADOPTED 12/19/06 P. 1-188 Policy ED-2.4.2: Secondary Benefits Promote the development of local businesses and enterprises that rely on the concentration of universities and health care institutions in the city, including both firms that provide supplies to these industries, and firms that benefit from their knowledge and research capacity. 710.4 Policy ED-2.4.3: Higher Education and Health Care Linkages Encourage continued linkages between the higher education and health care industries through facilities such as medical schools, teaching hospitals, and medical research centers. 710.5 See also the portions of this Element on the “Knowledge Economy” and “Increasing Access to 196 Employment” for additional policies and actions relating to higher education. ED-2.5 The Production, Distribution, and Repair Economy 711 Production, Distribution and Repair (PDR) jobs include the construction trades, utilities, transportation, publishing, manufacturing, wholesalers, and service providers such as commercial laundries. When these various industries are considered collectively, they account for approximately 10 percent of the District’s employment. PDR employment in the District has been stable over the past several years. Declines in some sectors, such as manufacturing, have been offset by growth in other sectors, such as construction and warehousing. PDR jobs are particularly desirable in the District, as they offer competitive wages to persons with limited education and academic credentials. 711.1 As discussed in the Land Use Element, the areas that currently accommodate many of the city’s PDR jobs have come under scrutiny as developers have run short of more favorably-located sites. This is particularly true around the New York Avenue Metro station, but is also the case on the New York Avenue industrial corridor and in other industrial areas such as Blair Road and Buzzard Point. Although Washington has never been an “industrial” city, it still must grapple with how much industrial land it can afford to lose before basic support services and municipal government functions are impaired (see “Industrial Land Use Study” text box 711.2 The production, distribution, and repair sector plays an important role in supporting other sectors of the economy. The federal government, the hospitality industry, the construction trades, and many of the District’s large private employers require services that are delivered from warehouses, trucking and distribution centers, and wholesale or manufacturing facilities. Media companies whose operations involve an industrial component, such as studios, also may locate in the District’s industrial zones. 711.3 [BEGIN SIDEBAR] Industrial Land Use Study 711.4 In 2005, the DC Office of Planning commissioned a detailed study of the city’s industrial lands from a land use, economic, and market perspective. This work included A survey of existing industrial tenants, and field surveys and mapping of land use patterns and physical characteristics of each industrial area An opportunities and constraints analysis of each sub-area based on the field surveys and mapping An economic analysis of the role that PDR businesses play in the DC economy Development of evaluation criteria for rezoning requests CITYWIDE ELEMENTS COMPREHENSIVE PLAN DISTRICT ELEMENTS ADOPTED 12/19/06 P. 1-189 Based upon a detailed demand analysis, the study found that DC currently requires 70 acres of additional land in which to house its municipal-industrial functions alone. The study also found that there is a limited supply of this type of land, and that much of the District’s industrial land is either undevelopable, has been rezoned, or is under significant development pressures. The study provided future land use recommendations regarding where industrial land should be preserved and where it may be rezoned. Two tracks of recommendations are provided. The first emphasizes zoning strategies to provide appropriate standards and protections for PDR businesses where continued PDR use is appropriate. The second consists of policy responses such as Industrial Business Improvement Districts, contracting assistance, and industrial parks, all of which are intended to promote 197 business development and growth in the PDR sectors. [END SIDEBAR] Policy ED-2.5.1: Industrial Land Retention Retain an adequate supply of industrially zoned land in order to accommodate the production, warehousing, distribution, light industrial, and research and development activities which sustain the local economy, support municipal services, and provide good employment opportunities for District residents. 711.5 Policy ED-2.5.2: Retaining Heavy Industry Ensure that basic manufacturing (M-zoned) land is retained within the District to support the heavy industries that are essential to the local economy, such as concrete and asphalt batching plants and waste transfer facilities. 711.6 Action ED-2.5-A: Industrial Business Improvement Districts Consider the formation of an Industrial Business Improvement District (BID) along the New York Avenue corridor to coordinate development activity, promote industrial tenant attraction and retention, and improve the functionality of the corridor as a viable industrial area. 711.7 See also Land Use Element Section LU-3.1 for additional policies and actions related to Industrial land retention ED-3.0 Supporting the Neighborhood Business Environment 712 The distinct characteristics of many of the District’s neighborhoods are expressed in their local shopping areas.

They provide places to interact with neighbors, and in many cases, a public domain with active street life and character.] From an economic development standpoint, the District’s neighborhood shopping areas generate property and sales taxes, provide jobs, and meet local needs for goods and services. The economic health of these areas varies widely across the city. In shopping districts that are thriving, the city will promote continued patronage, variety, and quality, while addressing issues such as parking and aesthetics. In shopping districts that are struggling, more strategic decisions must be made, taking into account the long-term CITYWIDE ELEMENTS COMPREHENSIVE PLAN DISTRICT ELEMENTS ADOPTED 12/19/06 P. 1-190 viability of each area. A range of solutions—including phasing out obsolete commercial areas in favor of new uses like housing—may be needed to address chronic challenges such as boarded up storefronts, concerns about public safety, and a lack of access to financing. 712.2 ED-3.1 Strengthening Neighborhood Commercial Centers 713 Part of growing an inclusive city involves improving access to basic goods and services for residents in all parts of the city. Currently, some areas of the District lack basic amenities such as grocery stores, hardware stores, drug stores, and dry cleaners. In other parts of the city, these services exist but they are poorly sited and do not provide the sense of community identity that they could. 713.1 Recently, commercial districts such as U Street have re-emerged as walkable shopping areas, with new development reinforcing the traditional pedestrian pattern. Other commercial districts have not fared 198 as well. This is especially true along long arterial streets, and in neighborhoods where certain commercial uses are in oversupply or are causing problems. The future market feasibility of each commercial area should be evaluated based on a number of factors, including architectural design and character, lot and block patterns, property ownership, surrounding uses, market competition, community support, traffic and parking, and the mix of existing businesses. 713.2 [Photo Caption: Commercial districts such as U Street have re-emerged as walkable shopping areas, with new development reinforcing the traditional pedestrian pattern.] To sustain viable commercial centers, it is essential that the city provide the police and fire protection, street and sidewalk maintenance, lighting, sanitation, and code enforcement services necessary to ensure the health and safety of merchants, residents, and shoppers. Transit and parking improvements are particularly important to improve access and minimize neighborhood disruption. The District is currently implementing a number of programs with these objectives. For example, the Great Streets initiative is focusing on capital improvements such as street lighting and tree planting. The Restore DC Main Street program is focusing on small business development and technical support. 713.3 Ultimately, the success of each neighborhood commercial district will depend on private investment and cooperation among merchants and property owners. Community development corporations and business improvement districts can assist through the services they provide and the local business enterprises they support. The city can assist by providing technical assistance, financial incentives, and support to merchant associations, and by coordinating its revitalization programs with those of the private and nonprofit sectors. 713.4 See the Framework Element (Generalized Policy Map) for a discussion of the District’s commercial centers, including neighborhood centers, multi-neighborhood centers, regional centers, and Main Street mixed use corridors. See the Land Use Element for a discussion of the District’s land use and development policies in neighborhood business districts Policy ED-3.1.1: Neighborhood Commercial Vitality Promote the vitality and diversity of Washington’s neighborhood commercial areas by retaining existing businesses, attracting new businesses, and improving the mix of goods and services available to residents. 713.5 Policy ED-3.1.2: Targeting Commercial Revitalization Continue to target government economic development programs to areas of greatest need, including older business areas and commercial centers that inadequately serve surrounding areas. Focus on those areas CITYWIDE ELEMENTS COMPREHENSIVE PLAN DISTRICT ELEMENTS ADOPTED 12/19/06 P. 1-191 where the critical mass needed to sustain a viable neighborhood commercial center can be achieved. 713.6 Policy ED-3.1.3: Commercial District Associations Encourage business improvement districts, merchant associations, Main Street organizations, and other 199 commercial associations that enhance economic development and commercial revitalization efforts, particularly in underserved and/or rapidly gentrifying neighborhoods. 713.7 Policy ED-3.1.4: Assistance for CDCs Encourage a network of active and effective community development corporations (CDCs) and similar neighborhood-based economic development groups. The District should assist CDCs and similar organizations in acquiring the necessary technical and financial skills to participate in neighborhood revitalization projects. It should integrate the work of such groups into the city’s overall planning and economic development initiatives. 713.8 [Photo Caption: The Restore DC Main Street program has helped revitalize the Barracks Row commercial district.] Policy ED-3.1.5: Public-Private Partnerships Leverage the expenditure of public funds to produce private sector investments, including joint development on publicly-owned land and redevelopment in areas considered to be high risks by investors. Support the involvement of local community development corporations in commercial development and revitalization efforts within these areas. 713.9 Policy ED-3.1.6: Revitalization Planning Link commercial revitalization strategies to capital budget priorities and larger neighborhood and transportation investment plans, including programs to improve transit to neighborhood centers. 713.10 Policy ED-3.1.7: Community Equity Investment Provide opportunities for community equity investment in local economic development projects. This may include methods of business financing that provide District residents with greater opportunities for equity shares in new development. 713.11 Action ED-3.1-A: Neighborhood Commercial Revitalization Expand commercial revitalization programs such as tax increment financing, Great Streets, and the District’s Main Street program to include additional commercial districts, particularly in the northeast and southeast quadrants of the city. 713.12 See also Action ED-2.2-A on the Retail Action Agenda ED-3.2 Small and Locally-Owned Businesses 714 Small goods and services businesses are an important part of what makes the District’s neighborhood commercial areas work. They provide full and part time employment opportunities for city residents and contribute to the city’s tax base. They help sustain the diversity of neighborhood shopping areas, and enable the marketplace to respond to changing business conditions and consumer preferences. It is the city’s small business proprietors that have initiated many of the District’s commercial revitalization efforts, driven by a desire and commitment to upgrade their businesses, properties, and neighborhoods. 714.1 CITYWIDE ELEMENTS COMPREHENSIVE PLAN DISTRICT ELEMENTS ADOPTED 12/19/06 P. 1-192 Approximately 95 percent of the businesses in the District have fewer than 50 employees. While these businesses represent just 34 percent of the District’s private sector jobs, they are an essential part of the city’s economic base. Sectors with high numbers of small businesses include construction, wholesale trade, retail trade, and food services. In fact, the average retail business in the city has about 10 employees and the average food service business has 17 employees. 714.2 The success of small businesses in these sectors and others is particularly important in the city’s economically distressed communities. Small businesses in these areas can catalyze neighborhood renewal and provide local jobs. The availability of working capital and other forms of financial and technical assistance is important to promote their success. 714.3 One of the potential downsides of revitalization is the loss of small businesses as national chains 200 move in. This can also result in the replacement of basic services with high-end specialty shopping that is not affordable to many residents. The District recognizes that neighborhood shopping areas should evolve in response to changes in consumer tastes and preferences, but it also recognizes the importance of avoiding displacement and economic hardship for the businesses that have anchored our city’s shopping areas for years. 714.4 [PULLQUOTE: The District recognizes that neighborhood shopping areas should evolve in response to changes in consumer tastes and preferences, but it also recognizes the importance of avoiding displacement and economic hardship for the businesses that have anchored our city’s shopping areas for years.] New programs may be needed to reduce “commercial gentrification” in the future. Measures should include but not be limited to income and property tax incentives, assistance to commercial tenants seeking to purchase their buildings, commercial land trusts (which buy local commercial space and hold it in perpetuity for the benefit of the community and relocation assistance programs for displaced business. Zoning strategies, such as limits on the size of businesses or the length of street frontage, and tying zoning relief (variances, etc to explicit requirements for the preservation of local serving small businesses also should be included. There are also federal programs like the HUBZone (Historically Underutilized Business Zone 714.5 Policy ED-3.2.1: Small Business Retention and Growth Encourage the retention, development, and growth of small and minority businesses through a range of District-sponsored technical and financial assistance programs. 714.7 Policy ED-3.2.2: Small Business Incubators Provide low-cost rental space (“incubators”) for small, home-grown businesses and start-up companies, particularly companies that are responsive to technological and economic innovation in the marketplace. A variety of spaces should be considered for business incubators, including vacant storefronts and surplus public buildings. 714.8 Policy ED-3.2.3: Access to Capital Expand access to equity, debt capital, long-term debt financing, and small business loans for small and medium-sized businesses. These tools should be used to leverage private investment in façade improvements, new and expanded business ventures, streetscape improvements, and other outcomes that help revitalize commercial districts and generate local jobs. 714.9 Policy ED-3.2.4: Large Business Partnerships Promote collaborations and partnerships between small businesses and the District’s major employers to increase contracts for small and disadvantaged businesses, including federal outsourcing contracts. 714.10 CITYWIDE ELEMENTS COMPREHENSIVE PLAN DISTRICT ELEMENTS ADOPTED 12/19/06 P. 1-193 Policy ED-3.2.5: Technology Transfer and Innovation Support ongoing efforts by the District’s colleges and universities to promote technology transfer and innovation, and provide technical and financial assistance to help local entrepreneurs and small businesses. These efforts should include small business “clinics” and small business course offerings at institutions of higher education. 714.11 Policy ED-3.2.6: Commercial Displacement 201 Avoid the displacement of small and local businesses due to rising real estate costs. Programs should be developed to offset the impacts of rising operating expenses on small businesses in areas of rapidly rising rents and prices. 714.12 Policy ED-3.2.7: Assistance to Displaced Businesses Assist small businesses that are displaced as a result of rising land costs and rents, government action, or new development. Efforts should be made to find locations for such businesses within redeveloping areas, or on other suitable sites within the city. 714.13 Policy ED-3.2.8: LSDBE Programs Expand opportunities for local, small, and disadvantaged business enterprises through city programs, incentives, contracting requirements, and other activities. 714.14 Action ED-3.2-A: Anti-Displacement Strategies Complete an analysis of alternative regulatory and financial measures to mitigate the impacts of “commercial gentrification” on small and local businesses. Measures to be assessed should include but not be limited to income and property tax incentives, historic tax credits, direct financial assistance, commercial land trusts, relocation assistance programs, and zoning strategies such as maximum floor area allowances for particular commercial activities. 714.15 [BEGIN SIDEBAR] Small and Minority Businesses 714.16 Minority business enterprises represent an important sub-set of small businesses in the city. Their growth and expansion remains a particularly high economic development priority. The District has established a Small Business Development One-Stop satellite center in the Department of Employment Services headquarters, in partnership with the DC Minority Business Development Center. The partnership focuses on enhancing the performance and profitability of minority business enterprises and provides an important resource for minority business recruitment, seminars, business skill enhancement, incubation services, networking events, and pro bono counseling. [END SIDEBAR] Action ED-3.2-B: Business Incentives Use a range of financial incentive programs to promote the success of new and existing businesses, including enterprise zones, minority business set-asides, loans and loan guarantees, low interest revenue bonds, federal tax credits for hiring District residents, and tax increment bond financing. 714.17 Action ED-3.2-C: Shopsteading Program Investigate the feasibility of a shopsteading program that would enable entrepreneurs and small businesses to open shop in currently vacant or abandoned commercial space at greatly reduced costs. 714.18 CITYWIDE ELEMENTS COMPREHENSIVE PLAN DISTRICT ELEMENTS ADOPTED 12/19/06 P. 1-194 Action ED-3.2-D: Small Business Needs Assessment Conduct an assessment of small and minority business needs and existing small business programs in the District. The study should include recommendations to improve existing small business programs and to develop new programs as needed. 714.19 Action ED-3.2-E: Best Practices Analysis Analyze what other cities have done to encourage and foster their small business sectors, including the development of business parks and incubators. Use this best practice information to inform District policy. 714.20 ED-4.0 Increasing Access to Employment 715 202 At the heart of an economic development agenda for the District is the need to create good quality jobs and wages for District residents. “Quality” jobs should offer stable employment with opportunities to advance. By improving the District’s educational system and job readiness programs, more residents may participate in the workforce, and the benefits of a stronger and more diverse economy can be more widely realized. 715.1 According to employment projections prepared by the Department of Employment Services (DOES over half of the jobs to be created by 2012 will require a bachelor’s degree or better. District students need to be equipped with the education needed for these jobs so they can fully participate and benefit from economic growth. 715.2 [PULLQUOTE: According to employment projections prepared by the Department of Employment Services, over half of the jobs to be created by 2012 will require a bachelor’s degree or better. District students need to be equipped with the education needed for these jobs so they can fully participate and benefit from economic growth.] In addition, the need to improve occupational skills, job training, and job placement in the city is clear. Although the region’s 3.2 percent unemployment rate in 2005 was lower than other comparable regions, and its job growth rate of 2.3 percent was the best in the nation, the District itself lags in key employment indicators. Its unemployment rate has been several percentage points above the region’s, and often twice as high. As shown in Figure 7.3, since 2000 the District has seen the peculiar trend of job growth coupled with rising unemployment. 715.3 [INSERT Figure 7.3:Unemployment Rate and Total Unemployment, District of Columbia, 1978-2004 715.4] Comprehensive action is needed on multiple fronts to address the issue of long-term unemployment. Continued efforts are needed to improve education, job training, and job readiness so that residents are equipped with the education and skills necessary to enter and remain in the workforce in jobs and careers that provide sufficient wages. Job readiness requires more than just reading, writing, and arithmetic skills; it also requires essential life skills—so-called “soft skills”, such as problem-solving, interacting with others, behaving responsibly, and organizing time effectively. 715.5 [PULLQUOTE: Continued efforts are needed to improve education, job training, and job readiness so that residents are equipped with the education and skills necessary to enter and remain in the workforce in jobs and careers that provide sufficient wages.] CITYWIDE ELEMENTS COMPREHENSIVE PLAN DISTRICT ELEMENTS ADOPTED 12/19/06 P. 1-195 There is also a need to recognize that many of the job opportunities potentially available to District residents are located outside the city. In fact, nine in ten of the new jobs created in metropolitan Washington during the next 20 years will be in the suburbs. Many of these jobs will be service, repair, sales and clerical positions suitable for entry-level employees or employees without advanced degrees. Thus, an important part of improving access to employment is improving access to the region’s job centers. 715.6 ED-4.1 Linking Education and Employment 716 The District continues to face serious challenges with respect to literacy, high drop-out rates, low test scores, and poor student performance. In 2005, the District’s State Education Office reported that 37 203 percent of the District’s residents functioned at or below a third-grade reading level. Nearly 75,000 District adults lacked a high school diploma or equivalent. Many of these individuals do not possess the skills that District jobs require—as a result, non-residents acquire most local jobs and residents do not. Looking forward, one of the District’s most significant economic development challenges will be to improve its educational system to ensure that District residents obtain the skills necessary to secure and keep good jobs, especially in high-growth occupations. The city’s literacy and educational deficiencies pose perhaps the greatest obstacle of all to achieving the vision of a more inclusive city. 716.1 As noted in the Educational Facilities Element of this Plan, the District’s public schools are in the midst of extensive reforms to improve curricula and upgrade the learning environment. More far-reaching efforts may be needed to create a supportive environment for learning outside the classroom, including strengthening services for families and resources for parents. Early childhood learning is also critical, ensuring that the city’s youngest residents have healthy, stimulating, and supportive pre-school years. 716. 2 In addition to strengthening basic curriculum and improving teacher quality, the District will support further efforts by the Board of Education and Public Charter School Boards to create vocational and magnet schools. Through its Career Technical Education Department, DCPS has already launched 12 career academies in its senior high schools. The academies provide distinct learning experiences, in some cases through business sponsorships, and give students a fast track into their chosen career. They emphasize achievement and performance, and encourage students to actively apply their skills and talents. 716.3 Although the work environment in the city is perpetually changing, it appears certain that living wage jobs in all industries will require higher skill levels in the future than they have in the past. Notably absent from the list of high growth occupations are those that simply require a high school diploma or equivalent. The District’s share of jobs requiring post-graduate education is already triple the national average (9.9 percent compared to 3.3 percent Conversely, positions requiring only a high school diploma currently represent 41 percent of the District’s jobs, compared to 55 percent at the national level. 716.4 [PULLQUOTE: Although the work environment in the city is perpetually changing, it appears certain that living wage jobs in all industries will require higher skill levels in the future than they have in the past. Notably absent from the list of high growth occupations are those that simply require a high school diploma or equivalent.] It is clear that the District’s “new economy” is bringing with it new skill and knowledge requirements. Developing and implementing a 21st century workforce curriculum will be essential to meet these requirements. Although it may take years to completely close the city’s educational gap, the District and CITYWIDE ELEMENTS COMPREHENSIVE PLAN DISTRICT ELEMENTS ADOPTED 12/19/06 P. 1-196 all of its workforce development partners are committed to a more comprehensive and integrated workforce preparation system moving forward. This will require more resources for adult education, certificate and associate programs, and the University of the District of Columbia, public-private partnerships with colleges and universities, as well as resources for our K-12 schools. 716.5 See the Educational Facilities Element for additional policies and actions related to educational facilities 204 including the desire for an east of the Anacostia River higher education campus Policy ED-4.1.1: Educational Improvements Continue collaborative efforts with the District of Columbia Public Schools and DC Charter School organizations to improve the quality of public education, reduce the drop out rate, and improve basic competency and skill levels among District youth. Every District child should be guaranteed a safe and productive learning environment that promotes academic and personal achievement. 716.6 Policy ED-4.1.2: Career-Oriented Curriculum Encourage the DC Public Schools and Public Charter Schools to continue to provide career magnet campuses, such as McKinley Technology High School and Marriott Hospitality Charter School. District government will advocate on behalf of its residents for expanded vocational training within its public schools. 716.7 Policy ED-4.1.3: Certification and Associate Programs Support the continued contributions of colleges and universities in providing career-building opportunities for District adults, including literacy and job training programs as well as professional certificate and two-year degree programs. The District will strongly support the University of the District of Columbia (UDC) as a public institution of higher learning, a place of continuing education, and a ladder to career advancement for District residents. 716.8 See the Educational Facilities Element for additional policies and actions related to UDC and improving access to higher education.

This could include placement programs to match students with employment opportunities in the city, loan forgiveness, and other programs to encourage graduates to live and work in the city. 716.17 ED-4.2 Increasing Workforce Development Skills 717 A competitive and marketable workforce is crucial to the economic health of the District. Workforce development strategies must combine public and private investment and initiative to close the occupational skills “vacuum” that now exists in the city. The goal of these strategies should be to help District residents achieve economic self-sufficiency while providing a skilled labor pool that meets the needs of local employers. 717.1 [PULLQUOTE: A competitive and marketable workforce is crucial to the economic health of the District. Workforce development strategies must combine public and private investment and initiative to close the occupational skills “vacuum” that now exists in the city.] In 1999, the District of Columbia Workforce Investment Council (DCWIC) was created to improve the skill level and employability of District residents. The Council is a public-private partnership consisting of private sector businesses, government leaders, faith and community leaders, labor leaders, educational representatives, and several DC Council members. For the last six years, DCWIC has led the charge to improve career information, counseling, job search assistance, and training. 717.2 A range of efforts have been launched by DCWIC in the last five years, including labor market surveys, a $20 million Lifelong Learning Initiative 120 million in tax increment financing to help spur job creation in District neighborhoods, a Faith and Community-Based Initiative, various Internet applications to improve case management, and new partnerships with the private sector. The District is also about to create a Job Opportunity Bank, with private sector funds used to provide job training programs and workforce development grants. 717.3 CITYWIDE ELEMENTS COMPREHENSIVE PLAN DISTRICT ELEMENTS ADOPTED 12/19/06 P. 1-198 Despite these initiatives, there is room for improvement. Some of the District’s job placement and training services continue to have low success rates. From the employer’s perspective, there is frustration that the reading, math skills, and computer knowledge of residents is still not at the level needed by business. Some members of the business community have called for customized training to specifically address employer needs. From the resident’s perspective, the administration of workforce development programs is perceived as slow and cumbersome. This is made more complicated by the myriad of agencies involved, the lack of effective monitoring, and the urgency of finding employment for those who seek assistance. 717.4 Presently, the District’s workforce development programs are administered through more than 20 federal 206 and city agencies, including the District Department of Employment Services and the District Department of Human Services. Many of these programs are operated through private and non profit organizations. The District itself operates a network of One-Stop Career Centers, each providing a range of job placement services. 717.5 The District also has created programs to support the hiring of local residents and local firms, particularly for District government contracts. For example, the First Source Program is a cooperative effort between businesses and the city to ensure that District residents have the first opportunity to apply for and be considered for jobs (see “First Source Program” text box In addition, DC Law 2-156 requires contractors who perform construction and renovation work with District government assistance to initiate apprenticeship programs through the D.C. Apprenticeship Council. There are also programs to eliminate discriminatory hiring practices. 717.6 Pursuing the District’s goal of “increasing access to education and employment” is also about providing opportunities for career advancement for residents. Many of the city’s entry level jobs have high turnover, low job security, few benefits, and remote possibilities for advancement. While these jobs may offer important initial opportunities, measures are also needed to provide opportunities for upward mobility and promotion. Some sectors, such as health care, higher education, and federal employment, may offer more promise for advancement than others. 717.7 Policy ED-4.2.1: Linking Residents to Jobs Promote measures which increase the number of District jobs held by District residents. According to the 2000 Census, 71 percent of the jobs in the city were held by non-residents, up from 67 percent in 1990. While recognizing that some imbalance is inevitable due to the relatively large number of jobs and small number of residents in the city, the District should work to increase the percentage of resident workers through its job training and placement programs. 717.8 Policy ED-4.2.2: Linking Job Training to Growth Occupations Target job training, placement, and vocational programs towards core and growth sectors and occupations, such as hospitality, higher education, health, construction, retail, and office support. 717.9 [BEGIN SIDEBAR] First Source Program 717.10 The First Source Agreement Program assures city residents priority for new jobs created by municipal financing and development programs. It mandates that all projects funded in whole or in part with District of Columbia funds, or other funds which the District administers, shall provide for increased employment opportunities for District residents. Each employer in the program must sign an agreement ensuring that: CITYWIDE ELEMENTS COMPREHENSIVE PLAN DISTRICT ELEMENTS ADOPTED 12/19/06 P. 1-199 All job openings created are listed with the Department of Employment Services 51 percent of new hires are District residents.

Continue neighborhood faith-based and community-based initiatives which deliver job training and placement services to unemployed and underemployed residents. 717.12 Policy ED-4.2.5: Business and Labor Partnerships Facilitate communication and partnerships between business, labor, commercial associations, and educational institutions to improve the skill levels of the District’s workforce, improve job training and placement resources, and improve the labor pool available to the District’s major employers. These partnerships could result in apprenticeship programs, pre-apprenticeship programs, entrepreneurial skills training, mentorship agreements, customized on-site job training, and vocational training. 717.13 Policy ED-4.2.6: Entry-Level Opportunities Support the creation of entry level career opportunities, particularly for lower income youth and adults, and persons with special needs. Recognize the need for complementary efforts to provide affordable child care options, transportation, counseling, and other supportive services. 717.14 Policy ED-4.2.7: Living Wage Jobs Promote the attraction and retention of living wage jobs that provide employment opportunities for unskilled and semi-skilled workers.

The feasibility of a community investment tax reduction should be explored for firms that establish major job training or retraining programs. 717.31 ED-4.3 Getting to Work 718 In 2000, 28 percent of all employed District residents worked in the suburbs. This percentage is fairly typical of large, older central cities—the comparable 2000 figures for Boston, Baltimore, San Francisco, and Philadelphia were 32, 38, 23, and 25 percent, respectively. However, the figure for the District was 22 percent in 1990, indicating fairly rapid growth in the number of reverse commuters in recent years. Despite the District’s best efforts to connect residents to DC jobs, the city is part of a regional economy and its residents are part of a regional labor pool. Most of the entry level and semi-skilled jobs in this economy are located in the Maryland and Virginia suburbs. 718.1 The District’s location at the center of the regional transportation network and Metrorail system provides good access to rail-served job centers like Bethesda and Rosslyn. However, there are few options other than driving or long bus commutes to reach the employment centers with the fastest projected growth rates—places like Reston and Fort Belvoir, Virginia, or National Harbor and Konterra (Beltsville Maryland. Even within the city, there are challenges to commuting resulting from crowded Metrorail trains and buses, congested roads, and costly parking for those who cannot conveniently use transit. 718.2 The extension of Metro to Tysons Corner and Dulles Airport will improve transit access to the region’s job centers, but its completion is many years away. Shorter-term and less expensive solutions, including ride-matching, carpooling, and vanpooling programs; shuttles to the region’s job centers; and additional reverse commuter bus routes, will be needed. Such solutions must be forged through regional agreements and partnerships, working through entities such as the Greater Washington Board of Trade, the DC Workforce Investment Council, and the Metropolitan Washington Council of Governments. 718.3 CITYWIDE ELEMENTS COMPREHENSIVE PLAN DISTRICT ELEMENTS ADOPTED 12/19/06 P. 1-202 [Photo Caption: Sustained investments in the city’s transportation system will improve access to jobs for District residents, particularly transit improvements between neighborhoods with high unemployment rates and the city’s major employment centers.] Policy ED-4.3.1: Transportation Access to District Jobs Improve access to jobs for District residents through sustained investments in the city’s transportation system, particularly transit improvements between neighborhoods with high unemployment rates and the city’s major employment centers. 718.4 Policy ED-4.3.2: Links to Regional Job Centers Continue to seek inter-jurisdictional transportation solutions to improve access between the District neighborhoods and existing and emerging job centers in Maryland and Virginia.

CITYWIDE ELEMENTS COMPREHENSIVE PLAN DISTRICT ELEMENTS ADOPTED 12/19/06 P. 1-203 CHAPTER 8 PARK, RECREATION, AND OPEN SPACE ELEMENT Overview 800 This Element addresses the future of parks, recreation, and open space in the District of Columbia. It recognizes the important role parks play in recreation, aesthetics, neighborhood character, and environmental quality. It includes policies on related topics such as recreational facility development, the use of private open space, and the creation of trails to better connect the city’s open spaces and neighborhoods. 800.1 The critical parks, recreation and open issues facing the District of Columbia are addressed in this Element. These include Coordination between the District of Columbia and the federal government on park and open space planning and management Providing additional recreational land and facilities in areas of the city that are currently underserved and in newly developing areas Maintaining, upgrading, and improving existing parks and recreation facilities as key features of successful neighborhoods in the District. The District has benefited from a legacy of far-sighted master plans that recognized the importance of parks and open space to the future of the city. The McMillan Plan of 1901 was prepared in part to beautify and better organize the District’s open spaces—the National Mall and Rock Creek Park that we know today are among its legacies. Many of the early plans prepared by the National Capital Parks and Planning Commission placed a similar emphasis on improving the city’s open spaces and parkways. 800.2 These historic plans have resulted in 7,600 acres of permanent open space and parkland in the District of Columbia, and one of the highest ratios of park acreage per resident in the country. Nonetheless, when the District achieved Home Rule and set about developing its first Comprehensive Plan, a “park and open space element” was not included. This responsibility was left to the federal government, primarily because over 85 percent of the District’s parkland is managed by the National Park Service (NPS) and is not under the city’s jurisdiction.2 800.3 211 Many of the policies within this Element express the District’s perspectives on the federally-owned parks that serve city residents. While the District has limited jurisdiction over these parks, the Comprehensive Plan acknowledges and supports the essential role that these lands play in meeting the recreational needs of District of Columbia residents, employees, and visitors. 800.4 Including a chapter on parks, recreation, and open space in the District Elements of the Comprehensive Plan is important for a number of reasons First, the District itself owns over 900 acres of parkland and there is a need for a coordinated set of policies for their management. 2 Policies for the Park Service lands are contained in individual General Management Plans prepared by the NPS, and are also included in the Federal Elements of the Comprehensive Plan. There have also been several joint District/ Federal park planning initiatives launched since the 1960s. CITYWIDE ELEMENTS COMPREHENSIVE PLAN DISTRICT ELEMENTS ADOPTED 12/19/06 P. 1-204 Second, access to quality parks and open space is a top priority for District residents—regardless of who owns the land. The fact that most of the city’s open space is federally controlled suggests that joint policy planning for these assets is essential Third, the city is changing, which means recreational needs also are changing. Policies are needed to make sure that new park and recreational opportunities are provided and existing parks are improved to meet the needs of a changing and expanding population. 800.5 The Comprehensive Plan is supplemented by a more detailed Parks Master Plan prepared by the District Department of Parks and Recreation in 2005-2006. That document should be consulted for more detailed guidance on facilities, recreational programming, and direction for specific District parks. Key data from the Parks Master Plan, including “benchmarking” data that compares the District to peer cities and the findings of a 2005 resident survey, are cited in this Element to provide context for the policies and actions. 800.6 Parks, Recreation, and Open Space Goal 801 The overarching goal for parks, recreation and open space is as follows: Preserve and enhance parks and open spaces within the District of Columbia to meet active and passive recreational needs, improve environmental quality, enhance the identity and character of District neighborhoods, and provide visual beauty in all parts of the national capital. 801.1 [PULLQUOTE: The overarching goal for parks, recreation and open space is as follows: Preserve and enhance parks and open spaces within the District of Columbia to meet active and passive recreational needs, improve environmental quality, enhance the identity and character of District neighborhoods, and provide visual beauty in all parts of the national capital.] Policies and Actions PROS-1.0. Park Planning and Land Management 802 This section of the Element focuses on parks that are owned and operated by the District of Columbia. Policies also express the District’s perspectives on the federally-owned parks that serve city residents. 802.1 The District manages an inventory of 359 properties, comprising 917 acres. More than two-thirds of these properties are small open space triangles formed by the intersection of diagonal avenues and the city street grid. The remainder includes 69 recreation center grounds, 50 neighborhood parks, and four large natural areas. 802.2 212 For planning purposes, park activities are usually divided into two categories: active recreation and passive recreation. Active recreation is associated with sports or play activities and requires facilities such as playgrounds, ballfields, tennis courts, and swimming pools. Passive recreation emphasizes the open space aspect of a park and includes activities like hiking and picnicking. In Washington, the presence of District-owned parks and National Parks provides a unique blend of active and passive recreational opportunities. 802.3 CITYWIDE ELEMENTS COMPREHENSIVE PLAN DISTRICT ELEMENTS ADOPTED 12/19/06 P. 1-205 [BEGIN TEXTBOX] The Parks Master Plan 803 In 2006, the District Department of Parks and Recreation drafted its first Comprehensive Master Plan since its establishment in 1942. Over the past 60 years, aspects of the park system have been addressed in strategic plans and other District reports, but there has been no overarching guide. The Draft Parks Master Plan sets the stage for a new and exciting future for park and recreation services and facilities in Washington. It provides strategic direction to address the public’s core issues and is intended to improve park management and operations in the city. It includes a detailed assessment of recreational needs in each of the District’s 39 neighborhood clusters, along with an assessment of the facilities serving each cluster. These assessments are intended to serve as tools for prioritizing future capital improvement projects. Specific outcomes of the Draft Parks Master Plan include New service standards for parks, recreational programs, and facilities Comprehensive information on the recreational needs of DC residents Projections of expected future needs, based on growth and demographics Information on customer usage and satisfaction Identification of current and potential shortfalls Strategies for overcoming shortfalls, including land acquisition and programming changes The Draft Parks Master Plan includes seven strategic policy directives to guide park planning and programming during the coming years. These directives call for an enhanced identity for the District’s park system, new programs to serve a diverse community, improvements to facility condition, better communication, more effective financial management, improved partnerships, and greater accessibility and connectivity. It also includes specific action steps and priorities for implementing these directives. [END TEXTBOX] [PULLQUOTE: “Redesign the parks to include safe play areas, gardens and separate exercise areas as well as seating areas. Look in all areas of the city for this opportunity.” — Suggestion from a participant in a Comprehensive Plan meeting.] PROS-1.1 Developing a Park Classification System 804 Most large cities in the United States have adopted classification systems to guide the management of their parks and open spaces. In fact, the National Recreation and Park Association (NRPA) defines park classification as “the basic element of the planning function.” Classification provides a basis for deciding which activities and facilities are appropriate within each park. It also provides a means of analyzing where service gaps exist and where acquisitions and capital improvements may be required. 804.1 Until 2006, the District’s parks were loosely classified as “large parks,” “neighborhood parks,” “recreation center grounds,” and “triangles.” These categories are not consistent with national standards, making it difficult to evaluate the adequacy of parks or to compare the District with peer cities. They are also not intuitive—the “large parks” are actually ecological areas (like Watts Branch and Kingman 213 Island some recreation centers have no “grounds” to speak of, and the “parks” category includes no acreage, service area, or facility standards. 804.2 CITYWIDE ELEMENTS COMPREHENSIVE PLAN DISTRICT ELEMENTS ADOPTED 12/19/06 P. 1-206 The 2006 Parks Master Plan has recommended a new classification system to improve customer service and park management. Under this system, the four “Large Parks” (Oxon Run, Watts Branch, Pope Branch, and Kingman/Heritage Islands) will be re-categorized into a broader category of conservationoriented open spaces. Recreation center grounds and neighborhood parks will be reclassified as “community” or “neighborhood” parks based on their size and amenities. The 231 triangles will be classified as “mini parks” and will be further distinguished based on their size and function. 804.3 Table 8.1 summarizes the park classification system. Map 8.1 shows the location of District-owned parks. The mini-parks are not shown due to the map scale and small size of these parks. 804.4 An important consideration in classifying the city’s parks is to recognize the role that federal lands play in the overall park system (noted in Policy PROS 1.1.2 below In many parts of the city, federal land plays a crucial role in meeting park, recreation, and open space needs. Some of the city’s parks are part of a contiguous system of parks and open spaces, with different areas under different ownership and management. Such systems need to be cohesively planned and managed, and not treated as individual isolated neighborhood or community parks. 804.7 [INSERT MAP 1: Location of District Parks] 804.6 Policy PROS-1.1.1: Park Classification Adopt and maintain a classification system to guide the future use of District parks. Table 8.1 provides the framework for this system. Follow general management prescriptions for each type of park, as defined by an official Parks Master Plan. 804.8 Policy PROS-1.1.2: Consideration of Federal Parkland Work with federal agencies to evaluate the role that federal lands play in meeting the recreational needs of District residents, particularly for regional parks and sports complexes. Because these properties are used by city residents, they should be considered when identifying underserved areas and assessing the need for local park improvements. 804.9 Policy PROS-1.1.3: Park Diversity Provide a diverse range of recreational experiences in parks within the District of Columbia, including a balance between passive and active recreational uses, and a mix of local-serving, region-serving, and national recreational uses. 804.10 Action PROS-1.1-A: Park Classification Complete the classification of each of the District’s 359 properties using Table 8.1.

CITYWIDE ELEMENTS COMPREHENSIVE PLAN DISTRICT ELEMENTS ADOPTED 12/19/06 P. 1-208 PROS-1.2 Closing the Gaps 805 At first glance, the District of Columbia appears to have a more than adequate supply of parkland. There are 12.9 acres of parks per 1,000 residents, compared to 9.0 acres per 1,000 in Baltimore; 7.2 acres per 1,000 in Philadelphia; and 7.0 acres per 1,000 in Boston (Trust for Public Land, 2004 However, most of Washington’s parkland consists of passive Natural Resource Areas. Neighborhood and community parkland is much more limited and amounts to less than one acre per 1,000 residents in many parts of the city. By contrast, suburban communities typically set standards of 4 or 5 acres of active parkland per 1,000 residents. 805.1 [PULLQUOTE: Most of Washington’s parkland consists of passive Natural Resource Areas. Neighborhood and community parkland is much more limited and amounts to less than one acre per 1,000 residents in many parts of the city.] Even neighborhoods with abundant parkland may lack access to recreational amenities and facilities. Other neighborhoods have parks that are too small to meet local needs. These neighborhoods include areas where significant growth is taking place, straining the ability of the facilities to meet neighborhood needs. Improved access to parks is also needed through improvements to bus service, enhancement to pedestrian and bicycle routes, as well as better security. 805.2 Recreational needs are also a function of demographics and density. The need for parks may be more 216 critical in some areas of the city due to Limited mobility due to low rates of auto ownership Larger numbers of children Larger numbers of apartment dwellers living in housing without useable open space Denser development patterns without the aesthetic amenities afforded by open space Larger concentrations of “at-risk” youth who may benefit from programmed recreational activities 805.3 These factors suggest that special attention be given to increasing useable open space in the city’s densest neighborhoods, even where parks already exist. 805.4 Policy PROS-1.2.1: Closing the Gaps Achieve a better distribution of parks in all neighborhoods of the city. This will require a priority on improving or expanding parks in a) more densely populated neighborhoods with limited open space b) areas that are more than ½ mile from a neighborhood or community park (or a federal park that serves an equivalent function c) areas where substantial new housing growth is expected, based on the forecasts of the Comprehensive Plan; and (d) areas where the existing recreation centers and parks are in poor condition.805.5 Policy PROS-1.2.2: Improving Access Improve access to the major park and open space areas within the city through pedestrian safety and street crossing improvements, bike lanes and storage areas, and adjustments to bus routes. 805.6 Policy PROS-1.2.3: Responding To Community Change Update and improve existing parks in response to changing demographics, cultural norms, and community needs and preferences. Parks should reflect the identity and needs of the communities they serve. 805.7 CITYWIDE ELEMENTS COMPREHENSIVE PLAN DISTRICT ELEMENTS ADOPTED 12/19/06 P. 1-209 Action PROS-1.2-A: Bus Routing Consult with WMATA to locate more bus stops on neighborhood and community parks, particularly those with recreation centers.

Too often, our parks have not been treated as the resource for revitalization and community empowerment that they should be. Some suffer from deferred maintenance, illegal dumping, and crime—others struggle to accommodate competing needs within limited space. A lack of consistent policies on park management has led to use conflicts within some parks and in some cases, land use between parks and the neighborhoods around them. 806.1 [PULLQUOTE: A park can be a symbol of a neighborhood’s vitality and character, or an emblem of its disorganization and lack of spirit. Too often, our parks have not been treated as the resource for revitalization and community empowerment that they should be.] Washington’s parks should be viewed as a limited and precious resource, no less valuable than the neighborhoods they serve. This requires that a consistent set of principles be followed for park design, programming, and planning. The following policies provide guidelines for systematically managing 217 the District’s parks to protect their long-term value. They are supplemented by more detailed park management guidelines in the Parks Master Plan. 806.2 Policy PROS-1.3.1: Balancing Competing Needs Manage the District’s parklands to protect and enhance their open space character while also accommodating a range of recreational activities. Park activities and facilities should be designed in a way that makes the best possible use of each space while minimizing conflicts between different recreational uses. 806.3 Policy PROS-1.3.2: Parks and Environmental Objectives Use park improvements to achieve environmental objectives such as water quality improvement, air quality improvement, and wildlife habitat restoration. 806.4 Policy PROS-1.3.3: Protecting the Triangle Parks Maintain the District’s open space triangles as neighborhood amenities supporting a range of activities. These activities should vary based on the setting of each triangle, and should range from planted “islands” to more active spaces. The triangles should be designed in a way that mitigates stormwater runoff and air pollution from adjacent corridors. 806.5 Policy PROS-1.3.4: Conversion of Parkland Open Space Protect the basic function of District parks as public open spaces and prevent parkland conversion to other uses. In the event that there is no other viable alternative to conversion, require that an equivalent or greater area of parkland is acquired and improved in the vicinity of the impacted site. 806.6 CITYWIDE ELEMENTS COMPREHENSIVE PLAN DISTRICT ELEMENTS ADOPTED 12/19/06 P. 1-210 Policy PROS-1.3.5: Park Buildings Require any new structure on District-owned parkland to be sited to minimize impacts on existing recreational activities and facilities, avoid encroachment onto athletic fields, and to retain as much of the site as possible as useable open space. Public buildings that do not relate to recreational needs should be discouraged from locating on city parkland, especially in areas with parkland deficiencies. 806.7 Policy PROS-1.3.6: Compatibility with Adjacent Development Design and manage park activities and facilities including recreation centers in a way that is compatible with nearby residential and commercial uses. 806.8 See also the Historic Preservation and the Urban Design Elements for additional policies and actions related to historic natural areas and the squares, circles and triangles associated with the L’Enfant Plan. See the Infrastructure Element for policies on the siting of communication towers (in parks and elsewhere) Action PROS-1.3-A: Open Space Zone Establish an Open Space zone district to cover District-owned parks, community gardens, and other lands where long-term open space preservation is desired. Develop limits on lot coverage and impervious surface coverage in this zone that recognize and protect the basic value of parkland as open space. The zoning provisions should ensure that any future construction within parks is limited to park-related uses and facilities. 806.9 Action PROS-1.3-B: Transfer of Triangles to DPR Consider the transfer of maintenance responsibilities for triangle parks from the District Department of Transportation to the Department of Parks and Recreation to recognize their primary function as parkland. 806.10 218 See also the Environmental Protection Element for policies related to preventing development on land adjacent to parks that would hinder access, destroy views, or otherwise compromise the value of parkland. Action PROS-1.3-C: Site Plan Review Require that plans for the redesign of individual parks or the development of park facilities are reviewed by appropriate District agencies to ensure that they advance the city’s goals for better public recreation facilities, environmental protection, open space preservation, historic preservation, public safety, and accessibility. 806.11 [PULLQUOTE: “Make bigger parks truly useable, safe, attractive, for residents.” — Participant at a Comprehensive Plan workshop] PROS-1.4 Meeting the Needs of a Growing City 807 The addition of thousands of new jobs and households over the next 20 years will increase demand for programmed parks, open space, and recreational activities. Existing parks will accommodate more users, particularly in neighborhoods where high-density infill development is planned. New parks will be needed to serve new and growing communities. Given the built out character of the city, finding land for such parks will be difficult and expensive. The District must seize opportunities for parkland dedication on its largest redevelopment sites and take steps now to ensure that parks are provided elsewhere as the city grows. 807.1 Presently, the District Department of Parks and Recreation operates approximately 3.5 acres of parkland for every 1,000 households in the city. If 55,000 households are added in the next 20 years, almost 200 CITYWIDE ELEMENTS COMPREHENSIVE PLAN DISTRICT ELEMENTS ADOPTED 12/19/06 P. 1-211 acres of new parkland would be needed to sustain this ratio. The 100 acres of new parks planned at the Southwest Waterfront, the near Southeast, Poplar Point, Hill East, and elsewhere along the Anacostia River will meet some of this demand. Additional parkland will be needed to serve growth and development in the north central and northeastern parts of the city, where a substantial amount of additional housing is planned in an area with a dearth of public parks. Substantial areas for new parks should also be designated in the reuse plans for any large federal sites that are transferred to the District or used for private development in the future. 807 .2 Creating new parks in built-up neighborhoods will be more challenging. There is competing pressure to use public land for other purposes, particularly revenue-generating uses like housing and office development. The city does not have a dedicated funding source for parkland acquisition (such as an impact fee) and capital improvement funds are typically used for new facilities rather than to buy vacant land. Acquisition may occur through a variety of means, such as donations and grants. Open space may also be set aside within new projects through development agreements and planned unit development amenity packages. Such open space should be usable and accessible and address open space needs of the area. 807.3 Policy PROS-1.4.1: Park Acquisition Acquire and improve additional parkland to meet the recreational needs of existing and future residents. This should occur both through the expansion of existing parks, and the development of new parks. 219 807.4 Policy PROS-1.4.2: Acquisition Methods Use a variety of methods to acquire and improve parkland, including easements, donations, land purchases, and park set-asides on new development sites. Recognize the impacts of new development on the need for additional park and recreational facilities, and mitigate impacts through dedication of parkland or in-lieu payments. 807.5 Policy PROS-1.4.3: Parks on Large Sites Include new neighborhood and/or community parks on large sites that are redeveloped for housing and other uses that generate a demand for recreational services. The potential for such parks to enhance the connectivity of parks and open spaces throughout the city should be an important planning and design consideration, particularly where multiple large adjacent sites are being redeveloped. 807.6 Policy PROS-1.4.4: Parks on Surplus Land Acquire and convert abandoned or tax delinquent land, surplus rail or road rights of way, and other land not in productive use into recreational use where feasible and appropriate, particularly in parts of the city that lack adequate access to parkland. 807.7 Policy PROS-1.4.5: Park Amenities on NPS Land Where consistent with other policies in the Comprehensive Plan and NPS plans, and where supported by nearby neighborhoods and needs assessments, encourage federal government projects that would provide new recreational amenities such as soccer fields, picnic areas, and trails serving District residents on national parkland. 807.8 Policy PROS-1.4.6: Parks in Employment Growth Areas Provide new parks and open spaces in areas of expected employment growth. Small pocket parks, plazas, and other open spaces should be created in the vicinity of the New York Avenue Metro Station, the Southeast Federal Center, the east end of Downtown, and the South Capitol Street Corridor to provide visual relief and space for outdoor seating and passive recreation. 807.9 CITYWIDE ELEMENTS COMPREHENSIVE PLAN DISTRICT ELEMENTS ADOPTED 12/19/06 P. 1-212 Action PROS-1.4-A: Park Impact Fee Study the feasibility (including potential fiscal and economic effects) of adopting a park impact fee that would require residential developers to help cover the cost of parkland acquisition and improvement. Such a fee would be based on a standard amount per dwelling unit or square foot, with the proceeds used to acquire or improve nearby parkland. 807.10 Action PROS-1.4-B: Mixed-Use Zones As part of the review of the city’s zoning regulations, revise the provisions for mixed-use zones to consider requirements for useable recreation space or payments in-lieu to meet recreational needs. 807.11 See also the Educational Facilities Element for polices on the use of school recreational facilities and lands. PROS-2.0 Park and Recreational Facilities 808 While the previous section of this Element focused on park planning, this section focuses specifically on park facilities. 808.1 The District currently operates 69 recreation centers, four specialty recreational facilities, 74 playgrounds, 99 athletic fields, 138 tennis courts, 31 swimming pools, and hundreds of basketball courts. These facilities are used to provide recreational services to residents in all parts of the city. Department of 220 Parks and Recreation activities range from aquatics, quilting, and environmental education to martial arts, personalized weight training, and even poetry slams. Many of the programs are targeted toward specific age groups, such as seniors and teens. Others are designed for persons with special needs or for families. 808.2 Demand for recreational programs—and the facilities that accommodate them—is expected to grow in the future as population grows. Demand will also be affected by cultural changes, new technology, sports and entertainment trends, and demographic shifts. The growth of the senior population, in particular, will influence future recreational needs in the city over the next 20 years. The text box at left provides an indication of current recreational habits and trends in the city, based on a 2005 resident survey. 808.3 [BEGIN SIDEBAR] The 2005 Parks Survey 808.4 One of the outcomes of the city’s 2006 Parks Master Plan was a resident survey that assessed the demand for recreational facilities in the city. A total of 421 responses were tabulated, including representative samples from each of the city’s eight wards. Key findings were 61 percent of the respondents had visited a DPR park in the last 12 months; 46 percent had visited a recreation center 37 percent of the respondents rated the condition of DPR parks as good or excellent; 46 percent rated them as fair or poor Half of the respondents (50 indicated they use the city’s National Parks for recreation 17 percent of the respondents spent more than 8 hours a week on recreation activities The most popular recreational activities were walking/jogging (43 playground use (23 swimming (24 and picnicking (23 About 56 percent of respondents indicated they walked to their local park; however, even more respondents said they drove (68 CITYWIDE ELEMENTS COMPREHENSIVE PLAN DISTRICT ELEMENTS ADOPTED 12/19/06 P. 1-213 Only about 16 percent of the respondents indicated they had participated in a DPR program during the last 12 months. The reasons residents gave for not participating included lack of information (36 lack of time (18 and concerns about personal safety (16 The highest priority expressed by respondents was the maintenance of existing parks, fields, and playgrounds. Maintenance of recreation centers was also a top priority. Lower priorities were the development of new play fields, new recreation centers, and small neighborhood parks. [END SIDEBAR] PROS-2.1 Assessing Recreational Facilities 809 Benchmarks provide a means of measuring the adequacy of the District’s recreational facilities based on “peer cities” and national standards. For example, Figure 8.1 indicates that the District has a higher number of recreation centers per 1,000 residents than Baltimore, Boston, Chicago, or Philadelphia. Similar analysis conducted during the Parks Master Plan found that the District ranked close to its “peer” cities in its number of swimming pools, was above average in tennis courts, and was well below average in athletic fields. These are citywide benchmarks, however. They also pertain to the quantity of facilities, rather to facility condition or quality. 809.1 [PULLQUOTE: The District has a higher number of recreation centers per 1,000 residents than Baltimore, Boston, Chicago, or Philadelphia. It also ranked close to its “peer” cities in its number of swimming pools, was above average in tennis courts, and was well below average in athletic fields.] 221 [INSERT Figure 8.1: Recreation Centers per 1,000 Residents 809.2] Map 8.2 shows the location of recreation center buildings in the city. The Map also shows a one-half mile radius—or about a ten-minute walk—around each center. Service gaps appear in neighborhoods like Fairlawn, Deanwood, Forest Hills, and Shepherd Park. Similar analyses for recreational facilities indicates a need for more athletic fields in the central part of the city, swimming pools in Upper Northwest, and tennis courts in the Mid-City and Capitol Hill areas. 809.3 The policies below provide general direction on how existing facility gaps might be closed and how new facilities can be provided to meet future needs. Again, the Parks Master Plan provides more detail on these issues and should be consulted for additional guidance and programmatic recommendations. 809.4 [INSERT Map 8.2: Recreation Center Buildings and Potential Service Area Gaps 809.5] Policy PROS 2.1.1: Recreational Facility Development Improve the physical and psychological health of District residents by providing a variety of recreational and athletic facilities, including playing fields, tennis courts, swimming pools, basketball courts, trails and paths, and open areas for other sports activities. 809.6 Policy PROS-2.1.2: Use of Benchmarks and Standards Develop recreational facilities in an orderly way by using benchmarks and service standards that help identify local needs. Direct investment in new facilities to the areas with the greatest unmet needs and areas where additional demand is expected in the future. 809.7 Policy PROS-2.1.3: Quality and Compatible Design Require all park improvements to be of high design and construction quality, sensitive to the natural environment, and compatible with surrounding land uses. 809.8 CITYWIDE ELEMENTS COMPREHENSIVE PLAN DISTRICT ELEMENTS ADOPTED 12/19/06 P. 1-214 Policy PROS-2.1.4: Responding to Local Preferences Provide amenities and facilities in District parks that are responsive to the preferences and needs of the neighborhoods around the parks. Park planning should recognize that there are different leisure time interests in different parts of the city. To better understand these differences, the community must be involved in key planning and design decisions. 809.9 Policy PROS-2.1.5: Adapting to Changing Needs Allow the development of facilities which respond to changing preferences and community needs in appropriate District parks, including fenced dog exercise areas (dog parks skate parks, tot lots, and water spray parks. 809.10 Action PROS-2.1-A: Capital Improvements Provide systematic and continuing funds for park improvements through the annual Capital Improvement Program. Use the Parks Master Plan as a guide for directing funds to the facilities and communities that are most in need. 809.11 Action PROS-2.1-B: Needs Assessments and Demographic Analysis Conduct periodic needs assessments, surveys, and demographic studies to better understand the current preferences and future needs of District residents with respect to parks and recreation. 809.12 See also the Community Services and Facilities Element for policies on the co-location of recreational uses with other public facilities. PROS-2.2 Providing Quality Service to All Residents 810 Maintaining a quality park system requires a high level of facility maintenance, modernization, and repair. An analysis prepared as part of the Parks Master Plan estimated that more than half of the District’s recreation centers are in fair to poor condition and should be considered for replacement by 2014. This includes the 25 recreation centers in the city that are more than 50 years old. 810.1 222 On a per capita basis, the District spends less on maintenance than peer cities like Boston, Baltimore, Chicago, and Minneapolis. Since 2003, however, its annual expenditures on park capital improvements have been higher than these cities. New facilities like Kennedy, Emery, Sherwood, and Turkey Thicket are replacing aging buildings and providing attractive new community centers. With more capital construction planned in the coming years, the District will need to dedicate additional funds to cover the higher expenses of operating and maintaining these facilities. 810.2 Similar efforts will be needed to address a wide variety of park planning issues, including the personal safety of park visitors, provisions for at-risk youth and residents with special needs, staffing needs, and the coordination of service delivery with other agencies. A steady, reliable stream of funds will be essential to keep our parks safe and attractive, and to respond to future needs. 810.3 [PULLQUOTE: A steady, reliable stream of funds will be essential to keep our parks safe and attractive, and to respond to future needs.] Looking ahead, new funding sources such as public/private partnerships, grants, and concessions may be necessary. A commitment to future funding should recognize the many tangible and intangible benefits that Washington’s parks provide to our neighborhoods. 810.4 CITYWIDE ELEMENTS COMPREHENSIVE PLAN DISTRICT ELEMENTS ADOPTED 12/19/06 P. 1-215 Policy PROS-2.2.1: Maintenance and Renovation Provide for the continuing maintenance, renovation, and upgrading of the District’s parks and recreational facilities to prevent their deterioration and ensure that they continue to meet community needs. 810.5 Policy PROS-2.2.2: Park Safety and Security Design parks, trails, and recreational facilities to improve public safety. Avoid creating hidden and difficult to access areas where security problems or vandalism could result. Lighting, fencing, building materials, and other design components should be selected to enhance the safety of park users. Park lighting shall be compatible with adjacent residential neighborhoods. 810.6 Policy PROS-2.2.3: Program Diversity Provide diverse recreational activities for persons of all ages and cultural backgrounds, distributed equitably in all parts of the city. Coordinate with other service providers, including DC Public Schools, to maximize the effectiveness of service delivery and minimize redundancy. 810.7 Policy PROS-2.2.4: Youth Recreational Services Provide recreational services that are particularly responsive to the special needs of the District’s youth, using recreation and athletics to promote self-esteem, responsibility, and leadership skills among DC teens. 810.8 Policy PROS-2.2.5: Special Needs Increase efforts to meet the needs of special population groups, particularly persons with disabilities. Provide “barrier free” access by modifying existing facilities to accommodate the needs of the disabled. 810.9 Policy PROS-2.2.6: New Funding Sources Seek out and pursue new forms of federal, non-profit, and private financial support to acquire, develop, and operate the District’s park and recreational facilities. 810.10 Policy PROS-2.2.7: Public-Private Partnerships for Recreation Consider joint public-private financing to develop or rehabilitate recreational facilities that cannot be provided by District government alone due to budgetary or fiscal constraints. 810.11 Policy PROS-2.2.8: Park Stewardship 223 Encourage volunteer assistance and stewardship in the maintenance of the District’s parks, particularly the triangle parks along major thoroughfares.

A comprehensive facility condition assessment should be performed for each recreation center at least once every five years. 810.15 Action PROS-2.2-B: Maintenance Standards Create official maintenance standards to improve the effectiveness of current maintenance and service levels for recreational buildings, facilities, and landscaping. Require adherence to these standards by maintenance contractors, as well as the District itself. 810.16 Action PROS-2.2-C: Adopt-A-Park Encourage community groups, businesses, and others to participate in the District’s Adopt A Park/ Adopt a Playground program and publicize the program through signs, advertisements, websites, and other media. 810.17 Action PROS-2.2-D: Data Tracking Implement computer tracking of data on facility use, costs, and revenues to make more informed decisions and to guide policies on fees, fee waivers, scheduling, and other aspects of facility programming. 810.18 Action PROS-2.2-E: Marketing and Branding Implement a unified marketing strategy to raise awareness of the variety of the District’s recreational program offerings and to more firmly establish an identity for the District of Columbia Parks. This strategy should use advertisements, web-based information and promotions, radio and television, branding, and other means to raise the profile of District parks. 810.19 See also policies in the Environmental Protection Element about “green” maintenance and green building practices, including requirements that future recreation centers meet Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design (LEED) Silver standards. PROS-3.0 Open Space Networks 811 The District of Columbia is characterized by four outstanding and distinct networks of open space: The Monumental Core, including the National Mall and adjacent areas in East and West Potomac Parks Rock Creek Park and the linear parks along its tributary streams, extending from the Potomac River to the Maryland border The Fort Circle Parks, forming a “ring” of open space approximately five miles out from the city center 224 The Anacostia and Potomac parklands, including linear parks along tributary streams 811.1 Each of these areas is profiled in more detail below. Together, they comprise 6,700 acres of parkland, or about 18 percent of the city’s land area. Because almost all of this land is under the control of the National Park Service, the policies presented here are intended to express the District’s aspirations for their long term management. They are statements of the District’s values and priorities, to be consulted by our federal partners as they plan and manage these important properties. 811.2 CITYWIDE ELEMENTS COMPREHENSIVE PLAN DISTRICT ELEMENTS ADOPTED 12/19/06 P. 1-217 In addition to the four open space networks described above, there are other important “chains” of interconnected open space across the city. Among the most significant is the corridor of District, federal, and institutional lands extending from McMillan Reservoir on the south to Fort Totten on the north. 811.3 This section of the Comprehensive Plan also includes a special focus on park and open space planning for Washington’s waterfronts. The need to improve connectivity between our open spaces through trails and greenways also is addressed. Policies on these topics are supplemented in Section PROS-4.0 with a discussion on “functional” open spaces that may augment this network, further contributing to community needs, environmental quality, and economic value. 811.4 [Photo Caption: Langston Golf Course is part of an open space network that spans both banks of the Anacostia River] Figure 8.2 compares the total parkland acreage within the District of Columbia to other high density US cities, using data from a recent analysis by the Trust for Public Land. 811.5 [INSERT Figure 8.2:Parkland Open Space, DC Compared to Other Cities 811.6, with caption: “The District ranks first among the 11 cities shown in terms of parkland acreage as a percent of total land area. Despite the apparent abundance of parkland, however, this resource is not evenly distributed across the city. Many residents still lack access to parks and natural areas.] PROS-3.1 Sustaining and Enhancing the Federal Open Space Systems 812 The National Mall and Environs Although the District of Columbia does not have jurisdiction over the National Mall and the adjoining open spaces in East and West Potomac Parks, these are arguably the most visible and high profile parklands in the city. They project the image of Washington to the world and attract millions of visitors each year. The future of the landscaped glades between the US Capitol and the Potomac River is the focus of national debate as the need for new monuments and memorials is balanced against the need to retain the Mall’s historic form, sight lines, and open quality. The Mall serves both the local community and the national community. It is integral to Washington’s history. The National Capital Planning Commission has prepared several important plans on these issues, including the Legacy Plan and the Museums and Memorials Master Plan. Both plans seek to preserve the historic proportions of the Mall, recognize its multiple functions as a passive and active open space, and expand the open space network to new areas along South Capitol Street and the Anacostia River. 812.1 [PULLQUOTE: The future of the landscaped glades between the US Capitol and the Potomac River is the focus of national debate as the need for new monuments and memorials is balanced again the need to retain the Mall’s historic form, sight lines, and open quality.] Several planning initiatives for the National Mall have been completed or are underway. In 2000, the 225 National Park Service completed a Comprehensive Design Plan for the White House and President's Park. The approved plan provides the management framework and flexibility needed to manage and protect the site for the presidency, and the public. In addition, in 2004, the non-profit organization National Coalition to Save Our Mall launched the National Mall Third Century Initiative (3C Initiative The mission of the 3C Initiative is to renew the vitality of the Mall through creative public use, wise stewardship for the next century, and appropriate expansion. The National Park Service, as managers of the National Mall, will be preparing a plan for its future over the next three years. The U.S. Commission of Fine Arts is also involved in planning and design decisions on the Mall. 812.2 CITYWIDE ELEMENTS COMPREHENSIVE PLAN DISTRICT ELEMENTS ADOPTED 12/19/06 P. 1-218 While all of these initiatives are critical, they have yet to provide a shared long-range vision for the multiple open spaces of the monumental core. An overall coordinated plan that looks at the future of this open space network, addressing issues such as transportation and Mall expansion, is still needed. 812.3 Rock Creek Park Rock Creek Park is the largest contiguous open space within the District, encompassing over 2,000 acres along the Rock Creek Valley and its tributary streams. The park’s scenic landscapes provide a respite from the cityscape of Washington. Each year, more than two million people visit the park to hike, picnic, play, and enjoy its rugged beauty. More than 12 million people a year use the park roads for commuting or scenic driving. In 2005, the National Park Service completed a General Management Plan for the largest unit of Rock Creek Park, providing guidance on how to best protect natural resources and manage visitor services. The goals of the GMP are to preserve and perpetuate the ecology of the Rock Creek Valley, protect archaeological and historic resources, provide for education and exploration, and create opportunities for recreation that are compatible with the park’s natural and cultural setting. The GMP itself includes management “prescriptions” that will guide future land use decisions and issues regarding road closures and traffic management. 812.4 The Fort Circle Parks At the start of the Civil War in 1861, a series of fortifications was built around Washington to protect the nation’s capital from a Confederate invasion. Among the fortifications were Fort Stevens—site of an 1864 battle; Fort Reno—the highest point in the District of Columbia; and Fort Dupont—the largest park east of the Anacostia River. After the Civil War, most of the 68 forts and 93 batteries were dismantled and the land was returned to its pre-war owners. Before they disappeared completely, a number of fort sites were purchased by the federal government and developed as parkland. An envisioned Fort Circle greenbelt featured prominently in the McMillan Plan of 1901, and with the advent of the automobile was proposed for a 23-mile circumferential parkway around the growing city (the Fort Drive 812.5 The National Park Service prepared aGeneral Management Plan (GMP) for the Fort Circle Parks in 2003. The GMP’s primary objectives include protection of ecological and historical values while accommodating local, recreational interests. The GMP seeks to remedy issues such as the 226 deteriorated state of the parks’ historical earthworks, concerns about visitor safety, and the lack of visitor services and interpretive facilities. Among the planned improvements are a new hiking trail linking the forts through existing parkland, new recreational features, coordinated signage, and new public access points. 812.6 The Potomac and Anacostia Parklands The two rivers and their associated tributaries such as Watts Branch and Pope Branch provide an important link in the District’s open space network. They provide protection for sensitive natural habitat, scenic beauty, and water-oriented recreation for District residents and visitors. Washington’s waterfront open spaces actually encompass an area larger than all of Rock Creek Park. However, a lack of continuity between the waterfront parks hinders their ability to function as an open space “network”. Many of the parks are disconnected or are cut off from one another by highways, railroads, industry, and other barriers. As part of the Anacostia Waterfront Initiative Plan, a riverwalk linking the individual Anacostia Parks into a system has been proposed and partially funded. There is also pending federal legislation that would transfer key waterfront open space lands from the federal to District governments. 812.7 Policies for the waterfront are presented in the section 3.2 of this Element. 812.8 CITYWIDE ELEMENTS COMPREHENSIVE PLAN DISTRICT ELEMENTS ADOPTED 12/19/06 P. 1-219 Policy PROS-3.1.1: Monumental Core Preserve the integrity of the National Mall open space, and advocate for federal plans and programs that protect this area from inappropriate or excessive development. 812.9 Policy PROS-3.1.2: East and West Potomac Parks Work with the federal government to protect and enhance the great open spaces of the monumental core beyond the National Mall, such as Hains Point and the Tidal Basin parklands. Consistent with the Federal Elements of the Comprehensive Plan, support the use of these areas for outdoor cultural events and celebrations, and for recreational activities and amenities that serve District residents and visitors. Planning for these areas should provide opportunities to expand the National Mall and better integrate East Potomac Park with the Southwest Waterfront across the Washington Channel. 812.10 Policy PROS-3.1.3: Rock Creek Park Ensure that the District’s land use and transportation decisions support the conservation of Rock Creek Park as a national scenic resource. Actively participate in discussions about the management of park resources, including roadways, recreational facilities, and environmental quality. 812.11 Policy PROS-3.1.4: Tributary Parks Maintain the scenic open space qualities and ecology of the city’s stream valley parks, including tributaries to the Potomac and Anacostia Rivers as well as tributaries to Rock Creek. Ensure that development adjacent to stream valley corridor parks does not compromise visual and ecological values and access to natural and forested areas. 812.12 See the Environmental Protection Element for additional policies on stream protection. Policy PROS-3.1.5: Fort Circle Parks Protect and enhance the Fort Circle Parks as an integrated network of permanent open spaces that connect neighborhoods, provide scenic beauty and historic interest, and offer a variety of recreational activities. Recognize these parks as an important city and national resource. Prevent District and federal actions that 227 would harm historic and ecological resources in the Fort Circle Parks, and strongly support actions that would improve their maintenance, connectivity, visibility, accessibility, and safety. 812.13 Policy PROS-3.1.6: Compatibility with Parklands Maintain and design public and private development adjacent to the edges of open spaces and parks to be compatible with these parklands and improve park access and safety. 812.14 Action PROS-3.1-A:Participation in Federal Planning Park Efforts Support and participate in National Park Service efforts to update the 1976 Master Plan for the National Mall, NCPC’s upcoming National Capital Framework Plan, and other federal initiatives to plan for the Mall in the 21st Century.

Virtually the entire Potomac shoreline north of Hains Point is publicly accessible, with such amenities as the C&amp;amp;O Canal towpath, Georgetown Waterfront Park, Thompson’s Boathouse, and Theodore Roosevelt Island. The shoreline affords stunning views of the city’s monuments and picturesque vistas across the river to Virginia. On the other hand, much of the 22 miles of shoreline along the Anacostia River is underutilized, unattractive, and inaccessible. 813.1 Along the Potomac, the District’s priority is conserving the federal parklands, retaining public access, and improving access where it does not exist today. Along the Anacostia, the priority is to link more than a dozen disconnected open spaces to create a unified system of first-class parks, and to connect these parks to the neighborhoods they adjoin. Figure 8.3 provides an overview of park recommendations for the Anacostia waterfront. The Area Elements should be consulted for additional detail. 813.2 [INSERT FIGURE 8.3: Overview of Proposed Anacostia Waterfront Park Recommendations 813.3. [Caption to figure: The District’s Anacostia Waterfront Initiative calls for a unified identity for more than 228 1,800 acres along the Anacostia River, including 100 acres of additional parks, many new community access points, and expanded waterfront recreational facilities. The Initiative also includes plans for a continuous riverfront trail, public access to the shoreline within new neighborhoods, interpretive nature and boating facilities, and pedestrian and bicycle bridges to better link the east and west sides of the River. The dark green areas in this figure indicate park areas to be added or enhanced, and the dashed line indicates a network of planned (or existing) hiking and biking trails.] Policy PROS 3.2.1: Protecting Waterfront Open Space Recognize the importance of the city’s waterfronts for recreation, public access, ecological protection, and scenic beauty. 813.4 Policy PROS-3.2.2: Connecting Neighborhoods to the Rivers Develop open space linkages between the Anacostia and Potomac Rivers and adjacent neighborhoods, using stream tributaries such as Watts Branch and Pope Branch as a framework for linear parks between the shoreline and nearby residential areas. 813.5 [The following policy has been moved from the former Anacostia Waterfront Element, was Sec 1508.4] Policy PROS-3.2.3: Linkages Between the Waterfront and Nearby Neighborhoods Establish stronger linkages between the waterfront and adjacent upland neighborhoods including Deanwood, Mayfair, Kenilworth-Parkside, River Terrace, Fairlawn, Twining, Kenilworth, Historic Anacostia, Carver-Langston, Kingman Park, Hill East, Capitol Hill, Barney Circle, and Southwest. CITYWIDE ELEMENTS COMPREHENSIVE PLAN DISTRICT ELEMENTS ADOPTED 12/19/06 P. 1-221 Maximize public access to the waterfront from these areas through the development of a riverwalk and shoreline trail, improved public transportation, redesigned bridges and freeways, and the extension of neighborhood streets and avenues to the water’s edge. 813.6 Policy PROS-3.2.4: Waterfront Visibility and Accessibility Improve access to the shoreline parks from across the city, and reduce barriers to waterfront access created by railroads, freeways, and non-water dependent industrial uses. However, no freeway or highway removal shall be undertaken prior to the completion of an adequate and feasible alternative traffic plan that has been approved by the District government. 813.6 [PULLQUOTE: “Programmed open spaces should also include innovative learning and play spaces in natural settings such as woodlands, meadows, streams and riverbanks.” — Suggestion from a participant in a Comprehensive Plan meeting.”] Policy PROS-3.2.5: Water-Oriented Recreation Provide for a variety of water-oriented activities, including fishing and boating, on the District’s rivers. Recognize both the Anacostia and Potomac Rivers as vital aquatic resources than can accommodate kayaking, canoeing, sculling, fishing, and other forms of water-oriented recreation. 813.7 Policy PROS-3.2.6: Shoreline Access On waterfront development sites under District jurisdiction, require public access to the shoreline unless precluded by safety or security considerations. 813.8 Policy PROS-3.2.7: Waterfront Park Design Require the design and planning of waterfront parks to maximize the scenic and recreational value of the rivers. Activities such as parking lots and park maintenance facilities should be located away from the 229 water’s edge, and environmentally sensitive resources should be protected. 813.9 Policy PROS 3.2.8: Upper Potomac Waterfront Partner with the National Park Service and other federal agencies to conserve open space along the Potomac waterfront and to protect the wooded and scenic qualities of the Potomac Palisades and adjacent islands and shoreline, including the creation of the Georgetown Waterfront Park. 813.10 Policy PROS-3.2.9: Lower Potomac Waterfront Support additional public access to the Potomac waterfront from the mouth of the Anacostia River southward. While general access is currently restricted due to existing uses (such as Bolling Air Force Base the District should identify long-term opportunities for shoreline open space and recreation, in the event that federal needs and use of this land change. 813.11 See also the Urban Design Element for additional policies and actions related to shoreline development and aesthetics and the Lower Anacostia Waterfront/ Near Southwest Element for additional discussion of the planned shoreline parks. Action PROS-3.2-A: Anacostia River Park Improvements Work collaboratively with the federal government, the private sector, community and non-profit groups, and the Anacostia Waterfront Corporation to implement the open space improvement plans of the Anacostia Waterfront Initiative.

Action PROS-3.2-B: Signage and Branding Work with the National Park Service to develop and implement a consistent system of signage and markers for the Anacostia and Potomac waterfronts. 813.13 Action PROS-3.2-C: Anacostia River Boating Develop additional marine facilities, including rowing centers, appropriately-scaled boathouses, boat slips, and piers along the banks of the Anacostia River as recommended in the AWI Framework Plan. 813.14 PROS-3.3 Other Significant Open Space Networks 814 The District’s formal open space networks are complemented by several smaller open space systems. These networks may be lesser known due to fragmented ownership and multiple functions, but they are no less important--particularly to the communities they serve. 814.1 A unique open space network comprised primarily of major federal facilities, cemeteries, and institutional uses is located just north of the city’s geographic center, in area otherwise lacking in public parkland. The network includes McMillan Reservoir, the Armed Forces Retirement Home, Rock Creek Church Cemetery, National Cemetery, and Glenwood, Prospect Hill, and St. Mary’s Cemeteries. This area was already established as a major recreational ground for Washington in the 19th century. Its role as such was confirmed by the 1901 McMillan Plan, which recognized the dual function of these lands as functional facilities and passive open spaces. While public access to many of these properties is restricted today, their presence as an open space corridor is plainly visible on aerial photos of the city. 814.2 230 Several sites in the McMillan to Fort Totten open space network are currently under consideration for development. As detailed plans are developed for these sites, the District must take an active role in conserving the connected open space network as an historic, ecological, aesthetic, and recreational resource. 814.3 Continued enhancement and preservation of open space networks in other parts of the city is also called for. These networks include the forested greenbelt along Oxon Run, the woodlands and wetlands around Oxon Cove (extending south into Maryland and the wooded areas extending from Westmoreland Circle to the Potomac River (including Dalecarlia Reservoir 814.4 Policy PROS-3.3.1: North-Central Open Space Network Protect and enhance the historic open space network extending from McMillan Reservoir to Fort Totten. As future land use changes in this area take place, an integrated system of permanent open spaces and improved parks should be maintained or created. 814.5 Policy PROS-3.3.2: Other Open Space Networks Recognize the recreational, scenic, environmental, and historic value of other interconnected or linear open spaces in the city, including Oxon Run, Oxon Cove, and the Dalecarlia Reservoir area. 814.6 CITYWIDE ELEMENTS COMPREHENSIVE PLAN DISTRICT ELEMENTS ADOPTED 12/19/06 P. 1-223 Action PROS-3.3-A: Creating “Washington Central Park” Work with the federal government, NCRC, and institutional and open space landowners to create a linear system of parks and open space extending from Bryant Street on the south to Fort Totten on the north. This system should be created from existing large publicly-owned and institutional tracts, as well as adjacent triangle parks, cemeteries, and rights-of-way. 814.7 See the Rock Creek East and Mid-City Area Elements for additional information on this network PROS-3.4 Connecting the City Through Trails 814 (to be renumbered Section 815, rest of chapter renumbered accordingly) Trails and linear parks are an important part of the open space network. They link the District’s open spaces to one another and provide access between neighborhoods and nature. In some cases, they provide stream buffers or visual edges within communities. There are many different kinds of trails, serving a range of recreational and transportation functions. Recent trail planning efforts have focused on improving bicycle mobility, and waterfront access, and showcasing the city’s cultural, historic, and scenic resources. 814.1 Key trail-building initiatives include the Anacostia Riverwalk and Fort Circle Parks Hiking Trail (both referenced in the previous section the Metropolitan Branch Trail between Union Station and Silver Spring, the Watts Branch Trail, the Georgetown Waterfront Trail, and the Potomac Heritage National Scenic Trail Plan (PHNST The PHNST is of particular interest, as it is one of the country’s 22 scenic national trails and includes multiple strands extending from the Chesapeake Bay to western Pennsylvania. Several of these strands pass through the District of Columbia. 814.2 In 2005, the District adopted an updated Bicycle Master Plan, including recommendations for improving bike routes and completing bike trails and bridges across the city. Among the key recommendations are eliminating gaps in the trail network, improving access along the Anacostia River, and linking the District’s trails to a larger regional network. The Bicycle Plan also recommends coordination with the 231 National Park Service to improve off-road trails like those traversing the National Mall, Rock Creek Park, Watts Branch, and Oxon Run (see Table 8.2 Additional details on the Bicycle Plan may be found in the Transportation Element of this Comprehensive Plan. 814.3 [PULLQUOTE: The Bicycle Master Plan recommends coordination with the National Park Service to improve off-road trails like those traversing the National Mall, Rock Creek Park, Watts Branch, and Oxon Run.] Policy PROS-3.4.1: Trail Network Develop a network of trails, paths, and linear parks to link the District’s open space areas and improve access to open space. Trails and paths should provide a safe and convenient way for residents to experience Washington’s scenery and natural beauty on foot or by bicycle. 814.5 Policy PROS-3.4.2: Linear Park Connections Work with the federal government to improve connections between the open spaces within the District of Columbia through land acquisition and park dedication, particularly where “gaps” in the city’s open space network exist.

Through collaboration and partnerships, community resources can be leveraged to dramatically improve access to open space and recreational services. Agreements with the federal government, the public and private schools, local colleges and universities, and the District’s major employers are an important part of the city’s efforts to broaden recreational choices for all residents. 815.1 Maximizing our assets also means redefining “open space” to include more than just parkland. Broadly defined, open space includes cemeteries, golf courses, reservoirs, institutions, parkways, military bases, and even private lawns and backyards. In this context, the value of open space may be its contribution to the city’s form rather than its use for recreation. Preserving a balance between development and open space is important in all District neighborhoods and essential to the health of the community. Similarly, provisions for high-quality open space in new development—including amenities such as balconies, courtyards, and landscaping—is important to the psychological well-being of future residents and the aesthetic qualities of the city. 815.2 PROS-4.1 Maximizing Access Through Partnerships 816 The need for joint planning to coordinate federal and District open space planning has been mentioned throughout this Element. In 2005, the District, the National Park Service, and the National Capital Planning Commission launched the CapitalSpace Initiative to increase access to green space for District residents and visitors (see text box at left Its particular focus is on improving access to parks in neighborhoods where they are in short supply, such as Central and Northeast DC. Similar joint planning and design exercises should be pursued with the District’s Public Schools, and with other local governments in the region. 816.1 Non-profit service providers also provide recreational facilities and programs for District residents. Groups like the United Planning Organization, Friendship House Association the Boys and Girls Clubs of America, and the YMCA/ YWCA fill gaps in local recreational services as they pursue their missions to foster the spiritual, mental, and physical development of individuals, families, and communities. Local colleges and universities also provide athletic programs and community services, many for free or at greatly reduced costs. These entities should not be viewed as competitors to the District’s own Department of Parks and Recreation, but rather as partners that can help increase recreational access for all. 816.2 Policy PROS-4.1.1: National Park Service Partnerships Promote expanded partnerships with the National Park Service and other District agencies to broaden 233 the range of recreational opportunities available to District residents. 816.3 Policy PROS-4.1.2: Joint Planning and Management Strategies Develop joint planning and management strategies for all parks where the District of Columbia and National Park Service have overlapping responsibilities. Use coordinated standards for lighting, fencing, walkways, maintenance, and security in these areas. 816.4 CITYWIDE ELEMENTS COMPREHENSIVE PLAN DISTRICT ELEMENTS ADOPTED 12/19/06 P. 1-226 Policy PROS-4.1.3: Greener, More Accessible Schoolyards Work with the District of Columbia Public Schools to improve the appearance and usefulness of schoolyards and outdoor recreational facilities such as playgrounds and athletic fields. Strive to make such areas more “park-like” in character, especially in communities without access to District- operated parks. 816.5 See the Educational Facilities Element for policies on joint use agreements between the District Government and DC Public Schools Policy PROS-4.1.4: Non-Profit Recreational Facilities Support the development of non-profit recreational facilities, such as Boys and Girls Clubs, to meet the recreational needs of District residents and complement the facilities provided by the District. 816.6 Policy PROS-4.1.5: Regional Open Space Planning Support federal, interstate and multi-jurisdictional efforts to preserve open space and create interconnected greenbelts and hiking trails within and around the Washington region. 816.7 [BEGIN SIDEBAR] CapitalSpace 816.8 Almost 20 percent of Washington, D.C.’s land area is devoted to parks and open spaces, ranging from the formal circles and squares established by the L’Enfant Plan, neighborhood “pocket parks”, large forested stream valley corridors, recreational centers, and waterfront parks. Planning, ownership and management of these different areas is provided by different branches of the District government, the federal government, and occasionally, non-profit organizations. The D.C. Department of Parks and Recreation, the National Capital Planning Commission, the D.C. Office of Planning, and the National Park Service have joined together in a new initiative, CapitalSpace, to establish a shared planning framework to address all of the parks and open spaces within the District. CapitalSpace is an opportunity to achieve a seamless system of high quality parks and open spaces meeting both national and local needs; addressing the often-competing demands placed on these spaces and clarifying their appropriate uses; ensuring that established and new neighborhoods have access to adequate parkland; and developing strategies to best use scarce resources to design, program, and maintain parks and open spaces to the highest possible standards.

Such space comprises hundreds of acres of public and private land in the District, including sites that are valued for their large trees, scenic vistas, and natural beauty. Some of these sites are regarded as public amenities, with features like hiking trails and lawns for picnics and other forms of recreation. Such spaces are particularly important in neighborhoods like Brookland, where conventional parks are in short supply. There and elsewhere in the District, the grounds of seminaries, hospitals, and cemeteries are informally serving some of the functions usually associated with a neighborhood park. 817.1 Retaining public access to these assets is important to the well-being of surrounding neighborhoods. Even where public access is not possible, the role of these spaces in improving the physical environment and shaping the visual quality of our neighborhoods should be acknowledged. 817.2 Policy PROS-4.2.1: Institutional Open Space Encourage local institutions, such as private and parochial schools, colleges and universities, seminaries, hospitals, and churches and cemeteries, to allow the cooperative use of their open space lands for the benefit of District residents. 817.3 Policy PROS-4.2.2: Utility Open Space Recognize the value of undeveloped land associated with utilities, reservoirs, and other infrastructure facilities in providing visual buffers for adjacent neighborhoods and opportunities for recreational trails. 817.4 Policy PROS-4.2.3: Parkways and Medians Enhance the visual and open space qualities of Washington’s streets and highways through the landscaping of medians, traffic islands, and rights of way. 817.5 Policy PROS-4.2.4: Freeway Joint Use Where compatible with adjacent land uses, support the use of land under or adjacent to freeways or other limited access roadways for passive open space, public art, or other uses which enhance the usefulness and appearance of such land. 817.6 Policy PROS-4.2.5: Podium Parks Consider the development of “podium” type open spaces and parks in the air rights over below-grade freeways, including the I-395 Freeway through Downtown DC, and the Southeast-Southwest Freeway near Capitol Hill. 817.7 Action PROS-4.2-A: Zoning Assessment of Institutional Land Conduct a study of institutional land in the city to determine the appropriateness of existing zoning designations, given the extent of open space on each site. Among other things, this study should assess how current zoning policies, including large tract review, planned unit developments, and campus plans, work to protect open space. Recommend zoning changes as appropriate to conserve open space and avoid incompatible building or redevelopment on such sites. This study should include a “best practices” CITYWIDE ELEMENTS COMPREHENSIVE PLAN DISTRICT ELEMENTS ADOPTED 12/19/06 P. 1-228 235 assessment of how other cities around the country achieve the goal of conserving functional open space without impairing economic growth or reducing development rights. 817.8 PROS 4.3 Open Space and the Cityscape 818 Improving open space is part of the District’s broader vision of “building green and healthy communities.” The following policies seek to increase the amount of open space in the city and protect open space where it exists today. Although these spaces are often small, they collectively make an important contribution to the livability of the city. 818.1 The District’s Zoning Regulations currently require “residential recreation space” when multi-family housing is developed in commercial zones. Depending on the zone district, up to 20 percent of a building’s floor area may be required to be set aside as residential recreation space, including rooftops, courtyards, and indoor recreational facilities. Additional zoning provisions seek to retain open space by setting lot coverage limits, and front and side yard requirements. The maximum area that may be covered by structures varies from 40 percent to 75 percent in residential zones and from 60 to 100 percent in commercial zones. “Creation or preservation of open space” is also defined as a public benefit or public amenity for the purpose of granting additional density in a planned unit development. 818.2 [Photo Caption: Podium parks use the air rights of below grade roadways to provide parks and plazas.] Policy PROS-4.3.1: Open Space in the Downtown Landscape Sustain a high quality network of downtown pocket parks, courtyards, arcades, plazas, and rooftop gardens that provide space for recreation, scenic beauty, and outdoor activities for workers, visitors, and residents. 818.3 Policy PROS-4.3.2: Plazas in Commercial Districts Encourage the development of outdoor plazas around Metro station entrances, in neighborhood business districts, around civic buildings, and in other areas with high volumes of pedestrian activity. Use the planned unit development process to promote such spaces for public benefit and to encourage tree planting, public art, sculpture, seating areas, and other amenities within such spaces. 818.4 Policy PROS-4.3.3: Common Open Space in New Development Provide incentives for new and rehabilitated buildings to include “green roofs”, rain gardens, landscaped open areas, and other common open space areas that provide visual relief and aesthetic balance. 818.5 Policy PROS-4.3.4: Protection of Open Space in Multi-Family Development Recognize the implicit value of the lawns, courtyards, gardens, and other open areas that surround many of the District’s older high- and medium-density residential buildings. Discourage the practice of building on these areas if the historic proportions and character of the original buildings would be compromised. 818.6 Policy PROS-4.3.5: Residential Yards Recognize the value of residential yards as a component of the city’s open space system and discourage increased coverage of such areas by buildings and impervious surfaces. 818.7 Action PROS-4.3-A: Residential Recreation Space and Lot Coverage Requirements Complete an evaluation of DC Zoning requirements for “residential recreation space” and “lot coverage.” Explore the feasibility of requiring residential recreation space in high-density residential zones as well as commercial zones, and establishing specific conditions for lowering or waiving the requirements. Consider a sliding scale for lot coverage requirements which considers parcel size as well as zone district. CITYWIDE ELEMENTS 236 COMPREHENSIVE PLAN DISTRICT ELEMENTS ADOPTED 12/19/06 P. 1-229 Incentives for the creation of parkland, including increases in allowable density where parkland is provided, also should be considered. 818.8 CITYWIDE ELEMENTS COMPREHENSIVE PLAN DISTRICT ELEMENTS ADOPTED 12/19/06 P. 1-230 CHAPTER 9 URBAN DESIGN Overview 900 The Urban Design Element addresses the District’s physical design and visual qualities. The Element describes the ways in which different aspects of the city’s landscape—especially its buildings, streets, and open spaces—work together to define impressions of Washington and its neighborhoods. The design and appearance of physical space can create connections or barriers. It can create a sense of safety or a sense of discomfort. Ultimately, urban design shapes perceptions of the city, and contributes to the way people interact and experience the environment around them. 900.1 The critical urban design issues facing the District of Columbia are addressed in this element. These include: Strengthening civic identity through a renewed focus on assets such as public spaces, boulevards, and waterfront areas Designing for successful neighborhoods and large site reintegration Improving the public realm, particularly street and sidewalk space Addressing infrastructure and other barriers that affect aesthetic qualities Promoting design excellence throughout the city. 900.2 Urban design is important to all American cities but has particular significance and importance in the Nation’s Capital. The city itself was designed to inspire American growth and prosperity. Streets were deliberately aligned to take advantage of natural topography and vistas, providing sites for monuments and important buildings and creating grand ceremonial spaces. 900.3 While great attention has been focused on the design of the monumental core of the city, its basic form has been set for many years. The same attention has not been consistently provided to the rest of Washington. Although the design of the built environment inspires civic pride and a strong sense of identity in some parts of the city, it has the opposite effect in others. 900.4 There is more that can be done to enhance Washington’s physical appearance. More of the city should benefit from the magnificent network of open spaces, waterfronts, and boulevards that is already in place. The traditional focus on the city’s symbolic identity must be matched with a greater focus on its urban identity—its identity as a city of distinct and beautiful neighborhoods. A stronger policy foundation is needed to protect the positive qualities that distinguish each of Washington’s communities while still allowing for innovative and creative design. The Urban Design Element includes diagrams to illustrate the principles suggested by its policies and actions. These diagrams are illustrative only. 900.5 Urban design objectives are interwoven through many of the Comprehensive Plan’s Elements. In particular, the Land Use, Transportation, Environmental Protection, Historic Preservation, and Parks, Recreation, and Open Space Elements all speak to the role that design should play in shaping the future of the city. The Plan as a whole recognizes the power of good design to transform and revitalize the city and its neighborhoods. 900.6 CITYWIDE ELEMENTS COMPREHENSIVE PLAN DISTRICT ELEMENTS ADOPTED 12/19/06 P. 1-231 237 Urban Design Goal 901 The overarching goal for urban design in the District is as follows: Enhance the beauty and livability of the city by protecting its historic design legacy, reinforcing the identity of its neighborhoods, harmoniously integrating new construction with existing buildings and the natural environment, and improving the vitality, appearance, and security of streets and public spaces. 901.1 [PULLQUOTE: The overarching goal for urban design in the District is as follows: Enhance the beauty and livability of the city by protecting its historic design legacy, reinforcing the identity of its neighborhoods, harmoniously integrating new construction with existing buildings and the natural environment, and improving the vitality, appearance, and security of streets and public spaces.] Policies and Actions UD-1.0 Toward A Stronger Civic Identity 902 Washington’s identity is defined by a particular set of physical features, including the Potomac and Anacostia Rivers, the topographic “bowl” of the original city and the rolling hills that surround it, the open spaces and dense tree canopy of its parks and neighborhoods, and the wide diagonal boulevards and rectangular street grid. The city is further defined by its horizontal skyline. The Virginia and Maryland suburbs contain the region’s tallest buildings while the central city is characterized by lower buildings of relatively uniform mass and height. 902.1 The character of the central city has largely been shaped by the L’Enfant and McMillan Plans and the 1910 Height of Buildings Act The L’Enfant Plan in particular set the stage for conditions that define almost every new development in the historic center of the city today. The radial arrangement of streets and public spaces has created many irregular and prominent building sites. The Height Act has resulted in a predominance of structures that are as wide as they are tall, and a street environment that has more in common with Paris than it does with New York, Chicago, and other cities in North America. 902.2 Beyond the city center, much of the District’s urban pattern consists of walkable, compact communities. A ring of more than a dozen well-defined neighborhoods lies within two miles of the edge of the National Mall. Beyond this ring, lie many more neighborhoods designed with the best features of traditional urbanism—housing near open space and transit, pedestrian-oriented shopping streets, and densities that create active street life. 902.3 The design pattern in the city’s outer neighborhoods is less formal than it is in the heart of the city. Their image is defined more by architecture, scale, tree cover, and topography than it is by monumental vistas. The neighborhoods contain a patchwork of building forms and styles spanning various periods in the city’s history, from narrow colonial townhouses to modernist towers. There are small traditional shopping districts, auto-oriented centers from the 1940s and 50s, and occasional strip malls and even “big boxes” from more recent years. Many of the neighborhoods were initially shaped by streetcar lines, creating a radial pattern of development that extends far beyond the city limits. 902.4 The impacts of past urban design decisions have not all been positive. The urban renewal and freeway building efforts of the 1950s and 60s, in particular, contributed to some of the social and economic divisions that exist in the city today. For instance, “slum clearance” in the Near Southwest destroyed the 238 CITYWIDE ELEMENTS COMPREHENSIVE PLAN DISTRICT ELEMENTS ADOPTED 12/19/06 P. 1-232 fine-grained fabric of an entire neighborhood, and dislocated thousands of residents. Future design decisions must help to reconcile some of the inequities that persist in the city, changing the District’s image from that of a divided city to one that is much more inclusive. In this regard, the design of Washington’s neighborhoods should provide even greater relevance for national identity than the monuments themselves. 902.5 [PULLQUOTE: Future design decisions must help to reconcile some of the inequities that persist in the city, changing the District’s image from that of a divided city to one that is much more inclusive. In this regard, the design of Washington’s neighborhoods should provide even greater relevance for national identity than the monuments themselves.] The text below is organized to respond to the following topics, each related to the urban pattern and identity of the city as a whole: Protecting the Integrity of Washington’s Historic Plans Respecting Natural Topography and Landform Improving Waterfront Identity and Design Strengthening Boulevards and Gateways Overcoming Physical Barriers 902.6 UD-1.1 Protecting the Integrity of Washington’s Historic Plans 903 Washington’s historic plans have proven to be extraordinarily resilient. The L’Enfant Plan has managed to accommodate the arrival of the streetcar, the subway, and most importantly, the automobile. In each case, elements of the original plan were altered and even transformed, but not at the expense of civic identity. The integrity of the District’s historic plans has been regulated and protected through the careful oversight of agencies like the National Capital Planning Commission and the Commission of Fine Arts. NCPC’s Legacy Plan (1997) and Memorials and Museums Plan (2001 in particular, have emphasized refinement and completion of many of the ideas originally proposed by L’Enfant and the McMillan Commission. 903.1 Protection of historic plans and a commitment to their underlying principles should extend across and beyond the monumental core of the city. Design decisions should reinforce the city’s pattern of axial, radial, and diagonal streets, and enhance the public spaces formed where these streets intersect one another (see Figure 9.1 Special places such as Mount Vernon Square and Judiciary Square should be highlighted through landscape improvements and building frontage requirements. 903.2 [INSERT Figure 9.1: Typical DC Irregular Spaces 903.4. Caption: Four examples of the irregular spaces created by the intersections of diagonal avenues with the rectangular street grid. These spaces present design challenges, but they also create opportunities.] Many of the District’s public squares, circles, triangles, and public “reservations” (see Figure 9.2 below) are undervalued and lack distinction. The District should work with the National Park Service and others to enhance these reservations as elements of the cityscape and important legacies of the earlier plans. Building placement should reinforce the identity of the city’s corridors and avoid obstruction of important vistas. 903.3 [INSERT Figure 9.2: Plan of L’Enfant Reservations (excerpt only) 903.5 Caption: The diagram on the right (which shows only a portion of the L’Enfant city) indicates historic open space reservations in green.] CITYWIDE ELEMENTS 239 COMPREHENSIVE PLAN DISTRICT ELEMENTS ADOPTED 12/19/06 P. 1-233 Policy UD-1.1.1: National Image Strengthen and enhance the physical image, character and outstanding physical qualities of the District, its neighborhoods, and its open spaces, in a manner that reflects its role as the national capital. 903.6 Policy UD-1.1.2: Reinforcing the L’Enfant and McMillan Plans Respect and reinforce the L’Enfant and McMillan Plans to maintain the District’s unique, historic and grand character. This policy should be achieved through a variety of urban design measures, including appropriate building placement, view protection, enhancement of L’Enfant Plan reservations (green spaces limits on street and alley closings (see Figure 9.3 and the siting of new monuments and memorials in locations of visual prominence. Restore as appropriate and where possible, previously closed streets and alleys, and obstructed vistas or viewsheds. 903.7 [INSERT Figure 9.3:Discouraging Alley and Street Closings within the L’Enfant Plan Area 903.10] [Caption: The diagram on the left (discouraged) shows streets and alleys abandoned to create larger building areas.

Basic principles of the Height Act are shown in Figure 9.4 below. 903.9 [INSERT Figure 9.4: Street Sections Indicating Height Act Regulations 903.11] Action UD-1.1.A: Siting of Landmarks Continue to convene a Commemorative Works Committee to advise and make recommendations to the Mayor and Council on requests to place monuments, memorials, and other commemorative works on District-owned space. Work with NCPC, the CFA, and other federal partners to ensure that the placement of such works on federal properties is consistent with the NCPC Monuments and Memorials Plan. 903.12 UD-1.2 Respecting Natural Topography and Landform 904 The escarpments, ridges, hills, plateaus, rivers, and streams of the District of Columbia are major components of the city’s identity. This is particularly true in the neighborhoods located on the hills and ridges beyond the L’Enfant city. The terrain creates a variety of views to, from, and in some instances, between significant resources. Views range from panoramic Fort Reno to the more intimate views of forested parks and stream valleys found in many neighborhoods east of the Anacostia River and in Northwest DC. 904.1 In many American cities, natural form has been destroyed through grading, rerouting of rivers, and clear cutting of forests. Not so in Washington. As Map 9.1 indicates, many of the city’s most prominent natural features remain intact today and are an important element of the District’s skyline. 904.2 Policy UD-1.2.1: Respecting Natural Features in Development Respect and perpetuate the natural features of Washington’s landscape. In low-density, wooded or hilly areas, new construction should preserve natural features rather than altering them to accommodate CITYWIDE ELEMENTS COMPREHENSIVE PLAN DISTRICT ELEMENTS ADOPTED 12/19/06 P. 1-234 240 development. Density in such areas should be limited and setbacks should be provided as needed to protect natural features such as streams and wetlands. Where appropriate, clustering of development should be considered as a way to protect natural resources. 904.3 Policy UD-1.2.2: Protecting the Topographic “Bowl” Consistent with the Federal Elements of the Comprehensive Plan, maintain the prominence of the topographic bowl formed by lowland and rim features of the L’Enfant city (see text box at left This should include preserving the green setting of the Anacostia hills and maintaining the visual prominence of the Florida Avenue escarpment. 904.4 Policy UD-1.2.3: Ridgeline Protection Protect prominent ridgelines so as to maintain and enhance the District’s physical image and horizontal skyline. 904.5 Policy UD-1.2.4: View Protection Recognize and protect major views in the city, particularly characteristic views of city landmarks, and views from important vantage points. Recognize the importance of views to the quality of life in the city and the identity of Washington and its neighborhoods. 904.6 [BEGIN SIDEBAR] The Topographic Bowl and the City Plan 904.7 The historic center of Washington occupies a low-lying “bowl” of river flats formed by the junction of the Potomac and Anacostia Rivers. The bowl is surrounded by a ring of hills, ridges, and upland areas. The flat topography of the area within the original L’Enfant city lends itself to radial boulevards terminating on monuments or far-reaching vistas. Such geometric road patterns would have been less effective on rolling hills. In outlying areas, where the topography is more varied, important landmarks are often closely related to features of the natural setting. The National Cathedral, for example, is sited on one of the highest ridgelines in the District, affording great visibility to the structure from many points in the city and beyond. Similar promontories exist east of the Anacostia River—on sites such as St. Elizabeths Hospital and along the Fort Circle Parks. [END SIDEBAR] [INSERT Map 9.1:Prominent Topographic Features of Washington 904.8] Action UD-1.2-A: Review of Zoning Designations Conduct a review of zoning designations in environmentally sensitive areas, including wetlands, riparian areas and upland areas along stream valleys, steep slopes, and areas of soil instability to identify areas where current zoning may permit excessive density, given site constraints. Recommend zoning changes and/or overlay designations as necessary to protect these areas. 904.9 Action UD-1.2-B: Creating View Plane Regulations Conduct a review of desirable views, creating view plane diagrams, affording analysis of desired possibilities, and developing zoning regulations accordingly. 904.10 CITYWIDE ELEMENTS COMPREHENSIVE PLAN DISTRICT ELEMENTS ADOPTED 12/19/06 P. 1-235 UD-1.3 Improving Waterfront Identity and Design 905 Although the confluence of the Potomac and Anacostia Rivers determined its location, Washington is not thought of as a waterfront city in the same way that Chicago is identified with its lake, New York with its harbor, or San Francisco with its Bay. The city’s connections to the water have been eroded by the construction of railroads and highways and the reservation of much of the shoreline for military and other 241 federal uses. The Potomac River is graced with many outdoor recreational amenities but is more connected to the National Mall than it is to the city’s neighborhoods. The Anacostia River, meanwhile, is almost invisible to the motorists who drive across it and is difficult to access from the neighborhoods it abuts. 905.1 There are certainly successful urban waterfront areas in the District. Georgetown’s Washington Harbour is lively and crowded and the Washington Channel is lined with marinas, restaurants, and fish vendors. But these areas represent a fraction of what might be, given the miles of shoreline within District boundaries. 905.2 Today, there is an unprecedented opportunity to refocus DC’s future civic identity along its “forgotten” and poorly linked waterfronts. With their expansive view corridors and natural backdrops, the waterfronts along the Anacostia and Potomac Rivers, as well as the Washington Channel, offer unique settings that are especially appropriate for great public spaces. As new parks and public spaces are created, missing links in the waterfront park system can finally be closed, and the river can be reintegrated back into the very neighborhoods it now divides. 905.3 Perhaps the greatest opportunity to bolster Washington’s identity as a waterfront city lies in the proposed redevelopment of the Anacostia shoreline. Good urban design is vital to the success of this transformation. New waterfront buildings should be appropriately related to each other, the water’s edge, and adjacent neighborhoods. The creation of view corridors and enhancement of existing views to the water are particularly important. Likewise, the development of new and/or enhanced public gathering spaces along each of the city’s waterfronts, as well as waterfront parks and plazas, boathouses and fishing piers, is essential. 905.4 [Photo Caption: Georgetown’s active waterfront includes a publicly accessible promenade, restaurants, and a docking area for boats traveling on the Potomac River.] Policy UD-1.3.1: DC as a Waterfront City Strengthen Washington’s civic identity as a waterfront city by promoting investment along the Anacostia River, creating new water-related parks, improving public access to and along the shoreline, and improving the physical and visual connections between the waterfront and adjacent neighborhoods. 905.5 Policy UD-1.3.2: Waterfront Public Space and Access Develop public gathering spaces along the waterfronts, including promenades, viewpoints, boating and swimming facilities, and parks. Such space should be designed to promote continuous public access along the rivers, and to take full advantage of site topography and waterfront views. Design treatments should vary from “hardscape” plazas in urban settings to softer, more passive open spaces that are more natural in character. 905.6 See also the Parks, Recreation and Open Space Element and the Lower Anacostia Waterfront/ Near Southwest Area Element for additional actions and policies related to providing continuous public access to the water’s edge and removing barriers to waterfront access. CITYWIDE ELEMENTS COMPREHENSIVE PLAN DISTRICT ELEMENTS ADOPTED 12/19/06 P. 1-236 Policy UD-1.3.3: Excellence in Waterfront Design Require a high standard of design for all waterfront projects, with an emphasis on shoreline access, integration of historic features and structures, an orientation toward the water, and the creation of 242 new water-oriented public amenities. 905.7 Policy UD-1.3.4: Design Character of Waterfront Sites Ensure that the design of each waterfront site responds to its unique natural qualities. A range of building forms should be created, responding to the range of physical conditions present. New buildings should be carefully designed to consider their appearance from multiple vantage points, both in the site vicinity and at various points on the horizon. 905.8 Policy UD-1.3.5: River Views Protect and enhance river views in the design of buildings, bridges, and pedestrian walkways on or near waterfront sites. The scale, density and building form along the city’s waterfronts should define the character of these areas as human-scale, pedestrian-oriented neighborhoods and should protect views from important sites.

Architectural and public space design should be conducive to pedestrian activity, provide a sense of safety, create visual interest, and draw people to the water. 905.11 Policy UD-1.3.7: Neighborhood Connectivity Improve the physical connections between neighborhoods and nearby waterfronts. Where feasible, extend the existing city grid into large waterfront sites to better connect nearby developed areas to the shoreline (see Figure 9.6 905.12 Policy UD-1.3.8: East of the River Gateways Improve the visual and urban design qualities of the gateways into East-of-the-River neighborhoods from the Anacostia River crossings, with landscape and transportation improvements along Howard Road, Martin Luther King Jr Avenue, Pennsylvania Avenue, Randle Circle (Minnesota and Massachusetts Benning Road, and Kenilworth Avenue This policy was moved here from the Anacostia Waterfront Element due to Planning Area Boundary Changes. Was 1509.10) Action UD-1.3.A: Anacostia Waterfront Initiative Continue to implement the Framework Plan for the Anacostia River, restoring Washington’s identity as a waterfront city and bridging the historic divide between the east and west sides of the river. 905.13 See Section UD-1.5 for a discussion of barriers to shoreline access. [INSERT: Figure 9.6: Extending Neighborhood Street Grids to the Waterfront 905.14] [Caption: The diagram at right shows the proposed Plan for the Southeast Federal Center. The city grid should be extended to the waterfront, restoring view corridors and connecting the neighborhood north of M Street to the river’s edge.] CITYWIDE ELEMENTS COMPREHENSIVE PLAN DISTRICT ELEMENTS ADOPTED 12/19/06 P. 1-237 UD-1.4 Reinforcing Boulevards and Gateways 906 Grand streets in the form of avenues and boulevards are another defining element of Washington’s urban form. The avenues originated as part of the L’Enfant design for the city. By overlapping a system of broad, diagonal thoroughfares on a grid of lettered and numbered streets, streets like Pennsylvania Avenue were given immediate importance, creating memorable views and a strong sense of civic identity. Beyond the heart of the city, these avenues extend to the outer neighborhoods, in some cases forming dramatic points of entry into the District of Columbia. Over time, several other streets in the city grid 243 were designed or redesigned to display similar characteristics. 906.1 The District’s avenues and boulevards are also emblematic of its social and economic divides. Some are thriving, while others are marked by boarded up buildings and degraded sidewalks. The most successful are located within the monumental core and west of 14th Street NW, encompassing such streets as Connecticut Avenue and Massachusetts Avenue. The less successful occur mostly in neighborhoods that are in transition, such as Georgia Avenue, Rhode Island Avenue, New York Avenue, Minnesota Avenue, Pennsylvania Avenue SE, South Capitol Street, and portions of North Capitol Street and East Capitol Street, East of the River. Good urban design is essential to reestablishing the city’s avenues and streets as positive elements of city form. 906.2 One of the intrinsic functions of avenues and boulevards is that they provide “gateways” into the District and its neighborhoods. An appropriate sense of transition and arrival should be provided at each gateway. This can be achieved through a combination of landscaping, streetscape amenities, signage, view protection, building and street design. 906.3 View protection is also another important objective along these streets. This is especially true on streets like North and South Capitol, which have symbolic importance but lack a commensurately grand streetscape. Distinctive street walls and facades, high-quality architecture, and street trees should provide greater focus and frame important vistas along these and other important thoroughfares. 906.4 Major avenues/boulevards and gateways are shown in Map 9.2. 906.5 [Three photos in left margin, with the following captions a) Tree-lined East Capitol Street gracefully welcomes visitors to the Capitol b) Commercial strip development and large parking lots make Rhode Island Avenue in Northeast DC a less successful avenue c) Memorial Bridge provides a ceremonial gateway to the District.] Policy UD-1.4.1: Avenues/Boulevards and Urban Form Use Washington’s major avenues/boulevards as a way to reinforce the form and identity of the city, connect its neighborhoods, and improve its aesthetic and visual character. Focus improvement efforts on avenues/boulevards in emerging neighborhoods, particularly those that provide important gateways or view corridors within the city. 906.6 Policy UD-1.4.2: City Gateways Create more distinctive and memorable gateways at points of entry to the city, and points of entry to individual neighborhoods and neighborhood centers. Gateways should provide a sense of transition and arrival, and should be designed to make a strong and positive visual impact. 906.7 [INSERT Map 9.2: Major Avenues, Boulevards and Gateways 906.8] CITYWIDE ELEMENTS COMPREHENSIVE PLAN DISTRICT ELEMENTS ADOPTED 12/19/06 P. 1-238 Policy UD-1.4.3: Avenue/Boulevard Vistas and View Corridors Protect views and view corridors along avenues/boulevards, particularly along streets that terminate at important civic monuments or that frame distant landmarks. Vistas along such streets should be accentuated by creating more well-defined street walls, improving landscaping, and requiring the highest architectural quality as development takes place see Figure 9.7 906.9 [INSERT Figure 9.7: Consistent Streetwall and Street Trees Framing Monumental Views 906.14] [Figure Caption: The figure above illustrates the use of street walls and street trees to frame views to 244 important landmarks (see text box describing street walls in Section UD-3.0] Policy UD-1.4.4: Multi-Modal Avenue/Boulevard Design Discourage the use of the city’s major avenues/boulevards as “auto-only” roadways. Instead, encourage their use as multi-modal corridors, supporting bus lanes, bicycle lanes, and wide sidewalks, as well as conventional vehicle lanes. 906.10 Policy UD-1.4.5: Priority Avenues/Boulevards Focus the city’s avenue/boulevard design improvements on historically important or symbolic streets that suffer from poor aesthetic conditions. Examples include North and South Capitol Streets, Pennsylvania Avenue SE, and Georgia Avenue and the avenues designated by the “Great Streets” program. 906.11 Action UD-1.4-A: Zoning and Views As part of the revision of the District’s zoning regulations, determine the feasibility of overlays or special design controls that would apply to major boulevards and gateway streets. The purpose of such overlays would be to ensure the protection and enhancement of important views and to upgrade the aesthetic quality of key boulevards. 906.12 Action UD-1.4-B: Boundary Streets and Entrances Explore the feasibility of enhancing points of arrival into the District at the major Maryland/DC gateways through signage, public art, landscaping, restoration of historic boundary markers, road design and pavement changes, special treatment of boundary streets (Southern, Eastern, and Western Avenues and similar improvements. 906.13 See the Land Use Element for additional actions relating to the city’s “Great Streets” program. See the Historic Preservation Element (HP-2.3.3) for more on protecting the special character of the L’Enfant Plan’s Streets. UD-1.5 Overcoming Physical Barriers 907 Physical barriers in the city such as highways and rail lines present urban design challenges. Besides their obvious impacts on walkability and aesthetics, they may create psychological and economic divides. Barriers not only include transportation features; they include natural features like rivers and streams, and land use features such as power plants and military bases. 907.1 There are a number of urban design solutions to better connect the city and reduce the effect of physical barriers. These include short-term techniques such as safer highway crossings for pedestrians and welllighted underpasses and longer-term solutions that eliminate barriers entirely. Examples of the latter include air-rights development over sunken freeways (such as I-395) and the rebuilding of the bridges across the Anacostia River with wider sidewalks and bike lanes. 907.2 [Photo Caption: Freeway underpasses in the District divide neighborhoods and contribute to blight] CITYWIDE ELEMENTS COMPREHENSIVE PLAN DISTRICT ELEMENTS ADOPTED 12/19/06 P. 1-239 Policy UD-1.5.1: Mitigating Freeway Impacts Reduce the negative effects of freeways on neighborhoods by decreasing blight around freeway overpasses and underpasses, and improving pedestrian and bicycle overpasses. Longer-term solutions that address the design of the freeways themselves also should be explored. Such solutions should consider rebuilding freeways to reduce their “iron curtain” effect and developing the air rights over sunken freeways. 907.3 Policy UD-1.5.2: Major Arterials Reduce the barrier effects created by major arterials (such as New York Avenue and South Capitol Street) through improved signal timing, traffic calming, mid-crossing medians, and other design improvements 245 that improve aesthetics and enhance safety at pedestrian crossings. 907.4 Policy UD-1.5.3: Reducing Railroad Barriers Upgrade railroad overpasses and underpasses to maintain the continuity of the street network along rail lines and ensure the comfort and safety of pedestrians and bicyclists. In appropriate settings, such as Downtown Washington, explore longer-term solutions to addressing railroad barriers such as air rights development over the tracks. 907.5 Action UD-1.5-A: Waterfront Barriers Continue to explore ways to address freeway and highway barriers along the Anacostia waterfront, including the removal of Water Street along the Southwest waterfront and the narrowing of I-395 at the Anacostia River. The city should also continue to study options for addressing the visual barrier presented by the Whitehurst Freeway and the physical barrier presented by the waterfront CSX rail line. 907.6 Action UD-1.5-B: Light Rail Design To the maximum extent possible, ensure that the design of the streetcar line along the east side of the Anacostia River does not create a barrier to waterfront access from East of the Anacostia River neighborhoods. 907.7 See also the Parks, Recreation, and Open Space Element for a discussion of trail policies, and the Lower Anacostia Waterfront/ Near Southwest Area Element for a discussion of detailed provisions related to barriers and access to the Anacostia River. UD-2.0 Creating Great Places 908 This section of the urban design element addresses design issues in three geographic settings: Central Washington Neighborhoods Large sites 908.1 UD-2.1 Place-Making in Central Washington 909 Some of the very qualities that make Central Washington’s design so memorable also create its greatest challenges. Distances are unusually long, walking is difficult in many places, and there is a lack of connectivity between the sub-districts of the central city. It is nearly four miles from the West End to the Navy Yard—arguably both are parts of the central business district—yet the two feel like entirely different cities. The District’s height limit, while lauded for its human scale, has also resulted in long CITYWIDE ELEMENTS COMPREHENSIVE PLAN DISTRICT ELEMENTS ADOPTED 12/19/06 P. 1-240 rows of featureless office buildings with little architectural interest. Moreover, Downtown is not particularly well integrated with the National Mall. To some extent, the Mall divides—rather than unites—the central city, and adds to the perception of a city with multiple downtowns bearing little connection to one another. 909.1 While the goal of creating a more coherent central business district has been in place for awhile, the current rapid pace of development means that the District must take a more proactive role. A stronger urban design framework is needed to attain the goal of a more cohesive and well-designed central city. 909.2 This framework should establish a stronger identity for the emerging business districts on the northeast and southeast edges of Downtown. It should improve streets and public spaces, promote a higher level of architectural quality, and establish appropriate scale and density transitions to protect small-scale residential neighborhoods on the edges of Downtown. It should include strategies to deal with specific site challenges, such as the isolation of the Kennedy Center from surrounding land uses, the poor pedestrian environment at L’Enfant Plaza, and the presence of industrial uses on New Jersey Avenue, 246 SE and Delaware Avenue just blocks from the US Capitol. 909.3 Design decisions for Central Washington should also address the peculiar architectural dynamics created by the 1910 Height Act. Currently, the desire to maximize buildable floor area while adhering to height limits often results in buildings with very little sculptural form. The most innovative and distinctive buildings tend to be public places—museums, libraries, and other structures where maximizing rentable space is not the primary objective. This is consistent with the city’s architectural heritage in some respects, but there are still opportunities to improve the design of office, residential, and retail buildings in the central city. 909.4 While the height limit clearly affects building form, it also affects street life in unexpected ways. It results in ground floors that are sunken below grade by as much as several feet to maximize the number of stories that can be accommodated in each building. This in turn creates challenges for street-level retailers, and impacts the experience of walking or shopping downtown. Other challenges include the appearance of vents, mechanical equipment, and other essential rooftop elements that exceed the maximum building height. The design of these elements takes on special importance given their high visibility on an otherwise “flat” downtown skyline. 909.5 [Photo Caption: Sunken retail space is common in the District, as it allows for additional square footage in buildings that are otherwise limited in size by the Height Act.] As the Historic Preservation Element notes, the presence of numerous historic buildings, historic districts, and important vistas also affects design. Attempts to create false facades mimicking historic styles, or to preserve facades and tear down the buildings behind them, have produced mixed results. As the existing stock of aging office buildings is replaced, greater attention must be given to design quality, street character, and landscape. 909.6 Policy UD-2.1.1: Design Character Create a more coherent design character for Central Washington by improving the physical linkages between the monumental core, the business sub-districts on the perimeter of the National Mall, and the expanding mixed use areas to the east and southeast of Downtown. Urban design strategies should focus on making the entire area more walkable, discouraging monolithic architecture, improving signage and streetscape features, and adding new land uses which make the area more lively, interesting, and dynamic. 909.7 CITYWIDE ELEMENTS COMPREHENSIVE PLAN DISTRICT ELEMENTS ADOPTED 12/19/06 P. 1-241 Policy UD-2.1.2: Downtown Street and Block Pattern Maintain a fine-grained pattern of Downtown blocks, streets, and alleys, with intersections and frontages that encourage pedestrian movement and reduce the potential for immense variations in scale and “fortress-like” office buildings see Figure 9.8) 909.8 [INSERT Figure 9.8: Superblock versus Fine-Grained Street and Development Patterns 909.13] [Caption: The diagram above contrasts the finer “grain” of a low-scale neighborhood with a downtown “superblock” (right, background) and a finer grained downtown block with multiple structures (left, foreground).] Policy UD-2.1.3: Downtown Edges Establish and maintain scale and density transitions between Downtown and adjacent lower density neighborhoods. Use variations in height, massing, and architectural quality to ensure that the fine- 247 grained pattern of adjacent neighborhoods is protected see Figure 9.9) 909.9 [INSERT Figure 9.9: Desired Scale Transitions at Downtown Edges to Residential Areas 909.14] [Caption: This diagram illustrates the desired transition for new development from a moderate density neighborhood to the high-density urban core, avoiding abrupt contrasts in scale and mass.] Policy UD-2.1.4: Architectural Excellence Promote excellence in the design of Downtown buildings and landscapes. Particular attention should be focused on ground floor (street) levels, with greater architectural details used to improve visual image. 909.10 Policy UD-2.1.5: Federal Coordination Coordinate with the federal government to achieve a consistent urban design vision for Central Washington. As applicable, the District should incorporate design concepts from the National Capital Planning Commission’s Legacy Plan and similar design-oriented plans for the monumental core of the city into its own design plans and strategies. 909.11 Policy UD-2.1.6: Pedestrian Bridges and Tunnels Discourage the construction of second-level Downtown pedestrian bridges that drain activity from the street level. Subterranean tunnels between buildings also should be discouraged, unless they improve access to Metro and are necessary for pedestrian safety. 909.12 [Photo Caption: Development along Chinatown’s 7th Street shows how contemporary designs can be integrated into historic settings.] Action UD-2.1-A: Retail Ceiling Heights Convene a Task Force of retailers, developers, architects, and others to evaluate alternative approaches to achieving higher first-floor ceiling heights in new Downtown buildings. 909.15 UD-2.2 Designing for Successful Neighborhoods 910 The “sense of place” in the District’s neighborhoods is a function of their cultural history, physical features, and visual qualities. Those neighborhoods with the strongest identities tend to share certain characteristics, such as walkable “centers”, well-defined edges, attractive streets, and character- defining architecture. This is most apparent in the city’s historic districts but it is also true in non-designated row house neighborhoods and in single-family neighborhoods where particular architectural styles, setbacks, and building forms prevail. Especially in row house neighborhoods, the repetitive use of form, materials, color, and spacing creates a sense of solidarity that transcends each individual structure. 910.1 CITYWIDE ELEMENTS COMPREHENSIVE PLAN DISTRICT ELEMENTS ADOPTED 12/19/06 P. 1-242 Not all neighborhoods have a strong sense of identity, however. Some are negatively affected by dilapidated buildings, poorly maintained properties, vacant storefronts, and worse. These problems may be exacerbated by the absence of landscaping and street trees. Infill development and the adaptive reuse of historic buildings in such areas create a real opportunity to establish a stronger identity, and to create neighborhood centers where they are lacking today. 910.2 The prospect of significant future growth in the city’s neighborhoods will require a heightened focus on architectural quality in both well established and emerging areas. In neighborhoods of high architectural quality and strong identity, a greater emphasis on design compatibility and appropriate scale is needed. These factors are also important in neighborhoods of weak identity, but the priority should be on 248 setting a higher design standard and defining a stronger, more positive image. 910.3 Regardless of neighborhood identity, overpowering contrasts in scale, height, and density should be avoided as infill development occurs. High quality materials that are durable and rich in texture and details should be encouraged. Firmly established building forms and landscape elements should be reinforced. These guidelines may seem self-evident, but they have not been consistently followed in the past. Even alterations and additions are not always sympathetic to architectural character, sometimes with jarring results. 910.4 The design of commercial and mixed use development also should be harmonious with its surroundings. This does not mean new buildings must duplicate adjacent buildings; rather it means that new construction should respect basic block characteristics like building alignment, access, proportion of openings (windows and doors exterior architectural details (cornices, parapets, etc and heights. Signage, awnings, and other exterior elements should be designed as an integral part of each structure and should avoid negative effects on the visual environment. Buildings should also provide for the comfort, safety, and enjoyment of their users, avoiding excessively windy conditions and providing sunlight or shade as is appropriate on each site. 910.5 Policy UD-2.2.1: Neighborhood Character and Identity Strengthen the defining visual qualities of Washington’s neighborhoods. This should be achieved in part by relating the scale of infill development, alterations, renovations, and additions to existing neighborhood context. 910.6 Policy UD-2.2.2: Areas of Strong Architectural Character Preserve the architectural continuity and design integrity of historic districts and other areas of strong architectural character. New development within such areas does not need to replicate prevailing architectural styles exactly but should be complementary in form, height, and bulk (see Figure 9.10 910.8 [INSERT Figure 9.10: Complimentary Massing for New Development in Historic Districts and Areas of Strong Architectural Character 910.7] [CAPTION: The top illustration shows inappropriate massing within the context of a historic district. The bottom illustration shows appropriate massing.] See the Historic Preservation Element for additional policies and actions related to historic districts. CITYWIDE ELEMENTS COMPREHENSIVE PLAN DISTRICT ELEMENTS ADOPTED 12/19/06 P. 1-243 Policy UD-2.2.3: Neighborhood Centers Undertake strategic and coordinated efforts to create neighborhood centers, civic buildings, and shopping places that reinforce community identity (see Figure 9.11 910.9 [INSERT Figure 9.11: Neighborhood Center Concept 910.11] [CAPTION: The area at 14th and Park NW is re-emerging as a strong neighborhood center for Columbia Heights.] Policy UD-2.2.4: Transitions in Building Intensity Establish gradual transitions between large-scale and small-scale development. The relationship between taller, more visually prominent buildings and lower, smaller buildings (such as single family or row houses) can be made more pleasing when the transition is gradual rather than abrupt. The relationship can be further improved by designing larger buildings to reduce their apparent size and recessing the upper floors of the building to relate to the lower scale of the surrounding neighborhood. 910.10 Policy UD-2.2.5: Creating Attractive Facades 249 Create visual interest through well-designed building facades, storefront windows, and attractive signage and lighting. Avoid monolithic or box-like building forms, or long blank walls which detract from the human quality of the street see Figure 9.12) 910.12 [INSERT Figure 9.12: Façade Articulation 910.18] [Caption: Façade Articulation on new residential development along 13th Street NW] Policy UD-2.2.6: Maintaining Façade Lines Generally maintain the established façade lines of neighborhood streets by aligning the front walls of new construction with the prevailing facades of adjacent buildings. Avoid violating this pattern by placing new construction in front of the historic façade line, or by placing buildings at odd angles to the street, unless the streetscape is already characterized by such variations. Where existing façades are characterized by recurring placement of windows and doors, new construction should complement the established rhythm. 910.13 Policy UD-2.2.7: Infill Development Regardless of neighborhood identity, avoid overpowering contrasts of scale, height and density as infill development occurs. 910.14 Policy UD-2.2.8: Large Site Development Ensure that new developments on parcels that are larger than the prevailing neighborhood lot size are carefully integrated with adjacent sites. Structures on such parcels should be broken into smaller, more varied forms, particularly where the prevailing street frontage is characterized by small, older buildings with varying facades see Figure 9.13 910.15 [INSERT Figure 9.13: Breaking Up Massing of Development on Lots Larger than Prevailing Neighborhood Lot Size 910.17] [The design on the left is generally preferable to the design on the right. Breaking large structures into smaller, more varied forms can reduce harsh contrasts and improve compatibility.] Policy UD-2.2.9: Protection of Neighborhood Open Space Ensure that infill development respects and improves the integrity of neighborhood open spaces and public areas. Buildings should be designed to avoid the loss of sunlight and reduced usability of neighborhood parks and plazas. 910.16 CITYWIDE ELEMENTS COMPREHENSIVE PLAN DISTRICT ELEMENTS ADOPTED 12/19/06 P. 1-244 Policy UD-2.2.10: Surface Parking Encourage the use of shade trees and landscaping or screening of surface parking areas. Parking should be designed so that it is not the dominant element of the street, and should be located behind development rather than in front of it (see Figure 9.14 910.19 [INSERT Figure 9.14: Parking Lot Location Behind Buildings Rather than in Front 910.20] Policy UD-2.2.11: Parking Structures Encourage creative solutions for designing structured parking to minimize its visual prominence. Where feasible, the street side of parking structures should be lined with active and visually attractive uses to lessen their impact on the streetscape (see Fig 9.15 910.21 [INSERT Figure 9.15: Concealing Parking Garages with Active “Liner” Uses 910.27] [Caption: The parking structure has been “concealed” behind the building, with active uses along the street frontage.] Policy UD-2.2.12: Strip Shopping Centers Ensure that zoning and parking standards discourage strip commercial shopping centers and auto- oriented 250 building designs within designated neighborhood centers. 910.22 Policy UD-2.2.13: Urban Design Priorities Focus the District’s urban design assistance efforts on neighborhoods where the original design character has been damaged by disinvestment, blight, and poor architecture. 910.23 Action UD-2.2-A: Scale Transition Study Complete a “Scale Transition Study” which evaluates options for improving design compatibility between more dense and less dense areas. The study should respond to the varying situations where higher density development is (or will be) situated adjacent to lower density, predominantly residential neighborhoods. It should include design guidelines and provisions for buffers (including open space stepping down of building heights, and solutions that reflect the different lot dimensions, block faces, and street and alley widths found in different parts of the city. 910.24 Action UD-2.2-B: Using Zoning to Achieve Design Goals Explore zoning and other regulatory techniques to promote excellence in the design of new buildings and public spaces. Zoning should include incentives or requirements for façade features, window placement, courtyards, buffering, and other exterior architectural elements that improve the compatibility of structures, including roof structures, with their surroundings while promoting high architectural quality. 910.25 Action UD-2.2-C: Conservation Districts Explore the use of “Conservation Districts” to protect neighborhood character in older communities which may not meet the criteria for historic districts but which nonetheless have important characterdefining architectural features. 910.26 See the Historic Preservation and Land Use Elements for Related Policies UD-2.3 The Design of New Neighborhoods 911 The potential redevelopment of a dozen or so “large sites” around the city provides particularly important urban design opportunities (see the Land Use Element for a map of large sites The large sites provide some of the city’s best opportunities for distinctive architecture as well as the application of green design CITYWIDE ELEMENTS COMPREHENSIVE PLAN DISTRICT ELEMENTS ADOPTED 12/19/06 P. 1-245 and low impact development principles. While these sites are largely discussed for their housing and economic development potential, their reuse can achieve parallel urban design objectives. They can and should improve neighborhood connectivity, create new open space, and define a stronger identity for adjacent areas. Large sites represent an unparalleled opportunity to knit the city together, address historic inequities, and position the District at the forefront of comprehensive planning; in short, they represent a major component of our inclusive city. 911.1 Policy UD-2.3.1: Reintegrating Large Sites Reintegrate large self-contained sites back into the city pattern. Plans for each site should establish urban design goals and principles which guide their subsequent redevelopment. 911.2 Policy UD-2.3.2: Large Site Scale and Block Patterns Establish a development scale on large sites that is in keeping with surrounding areas. “Superblocks” (e.g oversized tracts of land with no through-streets) should generally be avoided in favor of a finergrained street grid that is more compatible with the texture of Washington’s neighborhoods. This also allows for more appropriately scaled development and avoids large internalized complexes or oversized 251 structures (see Figure 9.16 911.3 [INSERT Figure 9.16: Large Site Planning Principles 911.4] [CAPTION: The street diagram at left is generally less preferable than the one at right, as it blocks the flow of pedestrian traffic to the waterfront and creates large, potentially inaccessible “superblocks.”] [BEGIN SIDEBAR] Urban Design Coordination at the Southeast Federal Center 911.5 One recent urban design success story is the Southeast Federal Center (SEFC The process of engagement between the District and the federal government on this site resulted in a plan that provides for mixed-use development, improved waterfront access, and the extension of the city street grid into a formerly secured area. Development has successfully proceeded by addressing security and liability concerns, and reusing a large portion of the site for federal office uses (USDOT The balance of the site will be redeveloped according to mutually agreed upon planning and urban design principles. The SEFC itself was planned in the context of a larger framework, the Anacostia Waterfront Initiative (AWI The AWI recognized the impact that this area’s transformation could have on revitalizing the Near Southeast neighborhood and achieving broader waterfront revitalization goals. [END SIDEBAR] Policy UD-2.3.3: Design Context for Planning Large Sites Ensure that urban design plans for large sites consider not only the site itself, but the broader context presented by surrounding neighborhoods. Recognize that the development of large sites have ripple effects that extend beyond their borders, including effects on the design of transportation systems and public facilities nearby. 911.6 Policy UD-2.3.4: Design Trade-offs on Large Sites Balance economic development and urban design goals on large sites. In some cases, it may be appropriate to develop a site in a manner that does not capitalize on its full economic value in order to achieve an important urban design objective, such as creation of new waterfront open space or preservation of a historic landmark. 911.7 CITYWIDE ELEMENTS COMPREHENSIVE PLAN DISTRICT ELEMENTS ADOPTED 12/19/06 P. 1-246 Policy UD-2.3.5: Incorporating Existing Assets in Large Site Design Incorporate existing assets such as historic buildings, significant natural landscapes, and panoramic vistas in the design of redeveloped large sites. For sites that were originally planned as integrated complexes of multiple buildings, historic groupings of structures should be conserved where possible. 911.8 Action UD-2.3-A: Design Guidelines for Large Sites Develop design guidelines for large sites prior to their development. Such guidelines should address building appearance and streetscape, signage and utilities, parking design, landscaping, buffering, protection of historic resources, “blending” of development with surrounding neighborhoods, and design principles that promote environmental sustainability. 911.9 Action UD-2.3-B: Form-Based Zoning Codes Explore the use of form-based zoning codes on selected large sites as a way of establishing desired urban design characteristics without rigidly prescribing allowable uses. 911.10 UD-3.0 Improving the Public Realm 912 The District’s “public realm” includes its streets, sidewalks, parks, plazas, civic buildings, and other public spaces. Such spaces represent half of the District of Columbia’s land area, with street rights- ofway alone accounting for over 10,000 acres. The design of public space provides some of the best opportunities for the District to improve aesthetics and image. More often than not, it is the quality of public space that defines the great cities and neighborhoods of the world. 912.1 This section of the Urban Design Element focuses on three objectives: 252 Improving the appearance and vitality of street and sidewalk space Balancing security and aesthetic considerations in public realm design Encouraging superior public building and infrastructure design 912.2 UD-3.1 Urban Design Hits the Street 913 Washington has a traditional urban street pattern, defined by small blocks and an interconnected grid, a hierarchy of major and minor streets, alleys in many neighborhoods, and a pattern of buildings that relates strongly to streets and sidewalks. This pattern creates animated street life in much of the city. Walkable streets make the city more accessible, inclusive, and environmentally friendly. They also promote public health and fitness. 913.1 The design of street space affects pedestrian safety and comfort. Changes to street and sidewalk width, parking configuration, crosswalks, intersections, and signals can improve the pedestrian environment. Well-defined edges and limited openings create a sense of enclosure which can make a street more animated and comfortable (see the text box below on street walls Street trees, street furniture (benches, trash receptacles, lighting, etc well-designed buildings, and active ground floor uses also contribute to the experience of walking, cycling, and driving, down a street or thoroughfare. Planning for streets and sidewalks must recognize the value of such spaces as public amenities, especially in high-density neighborhoods that lack access to parks, open space, and yards. 913.2 [PULLQUOTE: Street trees, street furniture (benches, trash receptacles, lighting, etc well- designed buildings, and active ground floor uses also contribute to the experience of walking, cycling, and driving, down a street or thoroughfare.] CITYWIDE ELEMENTS COMPREHENSIVE PLAN DISTRICT ELEMENTS ADOPTED 12/19/06 P. 1-247 The management of the space between the curb and the street wall should be guided by a number of objectives. As noted in the Environmental Protection Element, these include expanded street tree planting and the use of “low impact development” methods to reduce stormwater runoff. 913.3 SIDEBAR: Street Walls 913.4 [BEGIN TEXT BOX] Street Walls 913.4 “Street walls” refer to the facades of the various buildings that face a street. They shape the level of visual interest on each block, and create a sense of enclosure for travelers. High-quality architecture and landscaping can enhance the visual impact of the street wall and increase its economic value. Washington has a range of block and building types, creating a variety of street wall qualities. For example, streetwalls in rowhouse neighborhoods are defined by many narrow, repetitive buildings with multiple ground-floor entrances. The transformation of the U Street corridor shows how adaptable this form can be, and how well it can accommodate mixed uses and infill development. In contrast, K Street and other parts of Downtown Washington are characterized by very large buildings, with only a few facades per block. The resulting street walls are less forgiving. In these types of settings, it is critical that the lower floors provide more architectural detail and varied street level uses to improve visual interest. Policies that encourage a higher standard of storefront design, and richer, more durable building materials can have a tremendous effect on street wall success. 253 [Embedded Photo captions in the text box a) U Street’s rowhouses and varied street level uses make the street animated and comfortable for residents and visitors b)…while K Street’s large buildings and lack of appropriately-sized street trees do not.] “Activating” the street is another important objective—especially on neighborhood shopping streets. In many cities renowned for successful street life, there is an active relationship between interior and outdoor spaces. Lively sidewalk cafes, outdoor restaurant seating, and vendor shopping on the street can create a sense of commercial energy that is lacking on many streets in the District today. Streets can also be activated through complimentary ground floor uses (such as retail rather than offices) and a high level of transparency and window space. Similarly, residential streets can be animated through the use of porches, terraces, bay windows, stoops, and other architectural projections (see Figure 9.17 913.5 [INSERT Figure 9.17: Desirable Ground Floor Retail Configuration 913.11] [Caption: The diagram above shows key elements of a successful shopping street—ground floor retail, street trees, and sidewalks that are sufficiently wide for pedestrians and outdoor seating.] The need for streetscape improvements varies from one neighborhood to the next. Some neighborhoods have greater needs because they have greater density, greater traffic volumes, or larger numbers of children, seniors, and others with special mobility needs. Other neighborhoods may have serious deficiencies in the street environment that contribute to physical decline. Improving the streetscape can send a powerful message to residents, encourage private investment, and allay further economic and social deterioration. Likewise, the level of streetscape maintenance is one of the most important indicators of neighborhood upkeep. Maintenance across the city should be more consistent in the future, with all neighborhoods receiving the same high level of attention. 913.6 CITYWIDE ELEMENTS COMPREHENSIVE PLAN DISTRICT ELEMENTS ADOPTED 12/19/06 P. 1-248 Policy UD-3.1.1: Improving Streetscape Design Improve the appearance and identity of the District’s streets through the design of street lights, paved surfaces, landscaped areas, bus shelters, street “furniture”, and adjacent building façades. 913.7 Policy UD-3.1.2: Management of Sidewalk Space Preserve the characteristically wide sidewalks of Washington’s commercial districts. Sidewalk space should be managed in a way that promotes pedestrian safety, efficiency, comfort, and provides adequate space for tree boxes. Sidewalks should enhance the visual character of streets, with landscaping and buffer planting used to reduce the impacts of vehicle traffic. 913.8 Policy UD-3.1.3: Streetscape Design and Street Function Use variations in lighting and landscaping to highlight and clarify the function of different streets. The design features of streets should make the city’s circulation system easier to navigate and understand for residents and visitors. 913.9 Policy UD-3.1.4: Street Lighting Provide street lighting that improves public safety while also contributing to neighborhood character and image. 913.10 Policy UD-3.1.5: Streetscape and Mobility Ensure that the design of public space facilitates connections between different modes of travel, including walking, public transit, bicycling, and driving. Bus shelters, benches, bicycle parking, safe pedestrian connections, and clear wayfinding signage should be provided to facilitate multi-modal travel. 913.12 Policy UD-3.1.6: Enhanced Streetwalls 254 Promote a higher standard of storefront design and architectural detail along the District’s commercial streets. Along walkable shopping streets, create street walls with relatively continuous facades built to the front lot line in order to provide a sense of enclosure and improve pedestrian comfort. 913.13 Policy UD-3.1.7: Improving the Street Environment Create attractive and interesting commercial streetscapes by promoting ground level retail and desirable street activities, making walking more comfortable and convenient, ensuring that sidewalks are wide enough to accommodate pedestrian traffic, minimizing curb cuts and driveways, and avoiding windowless facades and gaps in the street wall. 913.14 Policy UD-3.1.8: Neighborhood Public Space Provide urban squares, public plazas, and similar areas that stimulate vibrant pedestrian street life and provide a focus for community activities. Encourage the “activation” of such spaces through the design of adjacent structures; for example, through the location of shop entrances, window displays, awnings, and outdoor dining areas. 913.15 Policy UD-3.1.9: Street Closures Strongly discourage the closure of streets for private ownership or use. Any request for street closure should be reviewed in terms of the resulting impacts on vehicular and pedestrian circulation, access to private property, emergency access and fire protection, view obstruction, loss of open space, building scale, and other factors. 913.16 See the Transportation and Land Use Elements for additional policies on street closures. CITYWIDE ELEMENTS COMPREHENSIVE PLAN DISTRICT ELEMENTS ADOPTED 12/19/06 P. 1-249 Policy UD-3.1.10: Sidewalk Cafes Discourage the enclosure of sidewalk cafes in manner that effectively transforms them into indoor floor space. The design of sidewalk cafes should be compatible with the architectural qualities of the adjoining buildings, should compliment the street environment, and should not impede pedestrian movement. 913.17 Policy UD-3.1.11: Private Sector Streetscape Improvements As appropriate and necessary, require streetscape improvements by the private sector in conjunction with development or renovation of adjacent properties. 913.18 Policy UD-3.1.12: Programming of Outdoor Space Encourage the programming of outdoor space with events and activities (such as performances, arts, and farmers markets) that stimulate streetlife and active use. 913.19 [Photo Captions a) A public plaza in Mount Pleasant provides a welcoming space for community activities b) Chinatown’s active ground floor uses, attractive sidewalks and use of interesting architectural detail enhances the street environment.] Policy UD 3.1.13: Signage Encourage high standards of signage throughout the District, particularly for signs that designate landmarks, historic districts, and other areas of civic importance. 913.20 [Photo Caption: Signage along the U Street Heritage Trail tells the story of this historic neighborhood.] See the Environmental Protection Element for policies on street tree planting Action UD-3.1-A: DDOT Design and Engineering Manual Update the DDOT Design and Engineering Manual (the “Red Book”) to ensure that it more effectively promotes the goal of creating a safe, attractive, and pedestrian-friendly street environment. 913.21 Action UD-3.1-B: Streetscape Improvement Programs 255 Maintain capital funding to upgrade the visual quality of District streets through programs such as Restore DC (Main Streets Great Streets, and the DDOT Urban Forestry program. 913.22 Action UD-3.1-C: DDOT Public Space Permits Ensure that all public space permits, including but not limited to permits for dumpsters, electric wiring, tree removal, excavation, parking, fences, retaining walls, signs and banners, sidewalk cafés, curb cuts, and special displays, are not inconsistent with the Comprehensive Plan and contribute to the policies laid out above for the use of street space. 913.23 Action UD-3.1-D: Paving of Front Yards Consider amendments to zoning regulations and public space guidelines which would limit the paving of front yard areas for parking and other purposes. 913.24 Action UD-3.1-E: Street Vending Review the street vending and sidewalk café regulations to ensure that they are responsive to the goals of creating lively and animated neighborhood streets but also adequately protect public safety and movement. 913.25 CITYWIDE ELEMENTS COMPREHENSIVE PLAN DISTRICT ELEMENTS ADOPTED 12/19/06 P. 1-250 Action UD-3.1-F: Sign Regulations Revise the sign regulations to improve the appearance and design of signs, and ensure that signs contribute to overall identity and sense of place while also expressing the unique identities of individual businesses. 913.26 UD-3.2: Balancing Security and Civic Life 914 Security has always been a factor in the design and development of Washington, DC, particularly around government and military facilities. The influence of security on the landscape has taken on new significance in the last five years, however. Some of the anti-terrorism measures implemented since 2001 have adversely affected the visual quality of the city. For example, the barriers around the city’s monuments and closure of key streets around the US Capitol convey a harsh and militaristic image that detract from the beauty of the city’s most important structures. 914.1 The reality is that security-conscious design is here to stay. The challenge facing the city now is to accommodate security needs without conveying the image of city under siege. The National Capital Planning Commission (NCPC General Services Administration, National Park Service, and other federal agencies have been advocating for design solutions that balance security and aesthetic needs; the Pennsylvania Avenue plaza north of the White House is a good example. Additional measures to integrate security measures more sensitively into the permanent design of streets and open spaces will be put in place by the federal government during the coming years. 914.2 Security needs also affect the design of many government buildings, and even the allowable mix of uses inside those buildings. Depending on their security designations, certain federal facilities are subject to very large setback requirements, limits on ground floor retail uses and public access, and restrictions on building openings and entrances. In some settings, these restrictions are at odds with the goal of creating pedestrian-friendly streets and animated public spaces. 914.3 Through coordinated planning and design, the District and NCPC are pursuing methods to plan buildings, 256 streets, and other aspects of the public realm in a manner that responds to homeland security needs without impacting the vitality of street life. This may mean that uses with higher security requirements are located on federal enclaves like the Naval Security Station and Bolling Air Force Base, while those with lower security requirements may remain downtown. 914.4 The city’s goals for crime prevention also have an important link to urban design. New development should be consciously designed to focus “eyes on the street” and avoid creating places conducive to criminal activity. This has been one of the major goals of the federal HOPE VI program and the city’s New Communities Initiative. The elimination of confusing internal street patterns and dead ends, upgrading of pedestrian walkways, use of appropriate landscaping, and creation of appealing, well- lighted public spaces can all work to effectively enhance public safety. 914.5 [Photo Captions a) A more attractive solution has been implemented at the Museum of the American Indian, where security and aesthetic needs are successfully balanced b) Makeshift security measures such as jersey barriers adversely affect District streets and sidewalks.] Policy UD-3.2.1: Federal Collaboration Collaborate with the federal government to plan for security and safety throughout the District without diminishing urban design quality and livability. Security needs should be considered from the beginning of the design process to ensure less intrusive and less disruptive solutions. 914.6 CITYWIDE ELEMENTS COMPREHENSIVE PLAN DISTRICT ELEMENTS ADOPTED 12/19/06 P. 1-251 Policy UD-3.2.2: Location of High-Security Uses Avoid the siting of projects with high security requirements in a manner that conflicts with the city’s urban design goals. Consider locating high-security projects in campus type settings to avoid the negative impacts that might result from their location in areas with active street life. 914.7 Policy UD-3.2.3: Site Planning and Design Measures to Increase Security Encourage architectural design and site planning methods that minimize perimeter security requirements and have a reduced impact on the public realm. Such measures include separating entryways, controlling access, “hardening” of shared walls, and the selection of more resilient building materials. 914.8 Policy UD-3.2.4: Security Through Streetscape Design Develop and apply attractive, context-sensitive security measures in the design of streets, plazas, and public spaces. These measures should use an appropriate mix of bollards, planters, landscaped walls, vegetation, and street furniture rather than barriers and other approaches that detract from aesthetic quality. 914.9 Policy UD-3.2.5: Reducing Crime Through Design Ensure that the design of the built environment minimizes the potential for criminal activity. Examples of preventive measures include adequate lighting, maintaining clear lines of sight and visual access, and avoiding dead-end streets. 914.10 Action UD-3.2-A: Security-Related Design Guidelines Work collaboratively with the National Capital Planning Commission and other federal agencies to develop design measures which accommodate security needs without disallowing ground level retail and other public space amenities. Such measures should include solutions to meet parking and service access needs for ground level retail, and less obtrusive methods of “hardening” buildings and public space. 914.11 Action UD-3.2-B: Neighborhood Surveys Conduct regular surveys of crime “hot spots” to identify where urban design issues such as 257 inadequate lighting and poor circulation may be contributing to high crime rates. Implement measures to address these issues through the redesign of streets and public space. 914.12 Action UD-3.2-C: Design Review for Crime Prevention Develop design standards for new neighborhoods, new communities, large tracts, and other major developments which reinforce crime prevention and security objectives. 914.13 See the Land Use and Transportation Elements for additional policies on street closures for security. UD-3.3 The Design of Public Buildings and Infrastructure 915 The District should lead the way to good urban design in the way it designs and builds its own public facilities. The design of civic structures should reinforce the District’s image as a forward-looking city that respects historic context while embracing change and innovation. Each library renovation, fire station addition, school modernization, recreation center construction project, and the like should be viewed as an opportunity to create a great civic building and character-defining public space. 915.1 [PULLQUOTE: The design of civic structures should reinforce the District’s image as a forward- looking city that respects historic context while embracing change and innovation.

The District is already home to one of the world’s great train stations (Union Station and the Metrorail system itself is an acclaimed piece of transportation architecture. The addition of streetcars, bus rapid transit systems, and their associated stations and stopping points will shape the identity of several neighborhoods in the next two decades. Similarly, the rebuilding of the Anacostia River crossings provides an opportunity for new bridges that become symbolic gateways and skyline icons, rather than the concrete viaducts that exist today. 915.2 Policy UD-3.3.1: Capital Improvements and Urban Design Use new capital improvement projects as opportunities to establish a positive image in neighborhoods which currently have poor design identity and negative visual character. 915.3 Policy UD-3.3.2: Design Excellence in Public Buildings Require design excellence for all public buildings and public space, with government leading by example to create a more attractive environment in the city and its neighborhoods. Important civic places, such as schools and libraries, should be individually designed to foster community identity and neighborhood character. 915.4 Policy UD-3.3.3: Design of New Public Transit Treat the design of mass transit systems, including the proposed streetcar and bus rapid transit systems, as an important form of public architecture. Bus shelters, waiting platforms, signage, on-street bicycle facilities, pedestrian connections, and other improvements should contribute to citywide urban design goals. 915.5 Policy UD-3.3.4: Metro Station Entrances Promote design improvements and public art at Metro station entrances, providing a stronger sense of arrival and orientation for travelers. 915.6 Policy UD-3.3.5: Design of Bridges and Infrastructure Promote high quality design and engineering in all infrastructure projects, including bridges and other public works projects. 915.7 [Photo Caption: Architectural excellence at the ARC (Town Hall Education Arts &amp;amp; Recreation Campus) 258 on Mississippi Avenue SE.] UD-4.0 Making Great Design Matter 916 The final section of the Urban Design Element includes program recommendations relating to urban design. The focus is on the expanded use of design guidelines and design review procedures to improve architectural quality in the city. 916.1 Currently, the level of design review varies from one part of the District to the next. In the heart of the city, new projects undergo extraordinary scrutiny—the design of monuments, museums, and federal buildings is even the subject of Congressional debate. The US Commission of Fine Arts is charged with reviewing the design of all public buildings, and private buildings adjacent to public buildings and grounds of major importance. Since the passage of the Shipstead-Luce Act in 1930, the CFA has had the authority to review construction which fronts or abuts the grounds of the US Capitol and White House, the Downtown portion of Pennsylvania Avenue, the Southwest waterfront, and most of the National Park CITYWIDE ELEMENTS COMPREHENSIVE PLAN DISTRICT ELEMENTS ADOPTED 12/19/06 P. 1-253 Service lands. The National Capital Planning Commission, likewise, evaluates the design of projects affecting the federal interest and may require modifications to improve architectural character and quality. NCPC reviews District of Columbia public projects (such as schools) and all projects on federal lands, and provides “in-lieu of zoning” review for public projects in the city center. 916.2 The District of Columbia government’s design review programs have traditionally been oriented to historic districts. Illustrative design guidelines have been prepared for historic districts, addressing windows, doors, roofs, foundations, walls, porches, steps, landscaping, and many other aspects of building and site design. As described in the Historic Preservation Element, the Historic Preservation Office and/or the Historic Preservation Review Board review thousands of permit applications for exterior alterations, additions, and new construction each year. The result is a high level of design integrity, which in turn has contributed to the value and economic importance of Washington’s historic districts. 916.3 [PULLQUOTE: The Historic Preservation Office and/or the Historic Preservation Review Board review thousands of permits for exterior alterations, additions, and new construction each year. The result is a high level of design integrity, which in turn has contributed to the value and economic importance of Washington’s historic districts.] In much of the city, however, design review requirements are minimal. Many projects are approved with a simple building permit, without an appraisal of their design impacts. The design of larger projects is routinely considered by the Zoning Commission, but in many cases without formal guidelines. Similarly, the city’s 37 Advisory Neighborhood Commissions weigh in on the design of many large-scale projects and public space permits, often suggesting changes that are incorporated by applicants. However, the process is ad hoc and the level of input varies from one ANC to the next. A more systematic and balanced approach to design review across the city would be helpful. 916.4 While the following policies do not recommend mandatory design review in all parts of the city, they do suggest a higher level of review than is occurring today. This is especially important in parts of the city where a large amount of infill development may take place in the next 20 years, including neighborhoods 259 east of the Anacostia River. Increases in public outreach, education, and design assistance will be needed as design review initiatives expand. Staff resources will also need to increase, to avoid delays in permit processing and ensure programs are properly administered and enforced. All policies should be implemented following consultation with affected communities. 916.5 Policy UD-4.1.1: Design Guidelines Develop illustrated design guidelines for selected residential areas and commercial districts addressing such architectural aspects as façade design, building texture and materials, lighting, detail, signage, and building to street relationship. Design guidelines should allow for flexibility and creativity, and in most cases should be performance-oriented rather than based on rigid standards. 916.6 Policy UD-4.1.2: Design Review Support expanded design review programs in the District, with a priority on areas not currently protected by historic district designation. 916.7 Policy UD-4.1.3: Design Assistance Encourage the use of technical assistance programs to educate and inform the public about design guidelines and to promote higher quality design. 916.8 CITYWIDE ELEMENTS COMPREHENSIVE PLAN DISTRICT ELEMENTS ADOPTED 12/19/06 P. 1-254 Policy UD-4.1.4: Creating A Design Culture Create an enhanced design culture in Washington through educational programs, museum exhibitions, design competitions, and school curricula. Pursue collaborations with the National Building Museum, the American Institute of Architects, and other professional design organizations to promote a broader public discourse on major urban design issues. 916.9 Policy UD-4.1.5: Small Area Plans Integrate urban design considerations into small area plans. Consider the use of illustrative design guidelines and place-specific urban design standards as part of these plans. 916.10 Action UD-4.1-A: DC Urban Design Agenda Prepare an “Urban Design Agenda” for the District of Columbia that articulates and illustrates citywide design principles for the city and its neighborhoods. 916.11 Action UD-4.1-B: Expanding Design Review Conduct an exploratory study on the expansion of design review requirements to areas beyond the city’s historic districts. The study should examine alternative approaches to carrying out design review requirements, including the use of advisory design review boards, and expansion of planning staff to carry out administrative reviews. 916.12 Action UD-4.1-C: Review of Zoning Requirements Adjust the processes and requirements for planned unit developments, site plans in the R-5-A zone districts, and large tract reviews in order to strengthen design amenities and promote higher design quality. 916.13 CITYWIDE ELEMENTS COMPREHENSIVE PLAN DISTRICT ELEMENTS ADOPTED 12/19/06 P. 1-255 CHAPTER 10 HISTORIC PRESERVATION Overview 1000 The Historic Preservation Element guides the protection, revitalization and preservation of the city’s valuable historic assets. It defines the District’s role in promoting awareness of Washington history, identifying and preserving historic resources, and ensuring compatible design in historic neighborhoods. 260 The Element recognizes historic preservation as an important local government responsibility that provides an opportunity for community input, development collaboration, partnerships, and education. 1000.1 The critical historic preservation issues facing the District of Columbia are addressed in this Element. These include Defining what constitutes a “historic” resource The standards and guidelines that apply to historic buildings and sites Enforcement of preservation laws Increasing public education and awareness of our city’s history and historic assets Washington is unique not only because it is the Nation’s Capital, but also because it is the great planned city of the United States. Pierre L’Enfant’s famous 1791 Plan for the city has been largely followed and respected over the past two centuries, and was reinforced and amplified by the 1901 McMillan Plan. The city’s grand plans were implemented slowly and fitfully, and perfected through a shared passion for civic embellishment that took root as the city matured. These plans were brought to life through the personal stories of a multitude of citizens who contributed their own dreams to the city. Washington is the capital of a democracy. In its wealth of different ideas, its rich and its poor, its messy vitality and its evident compromises, it reflects that fact in a multitude of ways its founders could never have predicted. 1000.2 Images of Washington have also changed, as have ideas about what to preserve from its past. Old Georgetown was rediscovered and protected by 1950, and in 1964 the national monuments ranked high on the city’s first list of landmarks worth saving. By the end of the 1960s, the Old Post Office and other Victorian treasures returned to favor as the rallying point for a new generation of preservationists. With Home Rule in the 1970s, the landmarks of the city’s African-American heritage finally gained the attention they deserved. 1000.3 In the District of Columbia today, there are more than 600 historic landmarks and more than 40 historic districts, half of which are local neighborhoods. In all, nearly 25,000 properties are protected by historic designation. Historic landmarks include the iconic monuments and the symbolic commemorative places that define Washington, DC as the Nation’s Capital, but they also include retail and commercial centers, residences, and places of worship and leisure of thousands of ordinary citizens who call “DC” home. 1000.4 Preservation needs in the city are constantly changing. Fifty years ago, the biggest challenge was to prevent the demolition of entire neighborhoods for freeways and “urban renewal.” Today’s challenges include unprecedented pressure for new growth, soaring property values, and escalating construction costs. Gentrification is the issue in some historic neighborhoods, but in others it is decay. Unprecedented security considerations, tourism management, and the preservation of buildings from the recent past are high on the preservation agenda. 1000.5 CITYWIDE ELEMENTS COMPREHENSIVE PLAN DISTRICT ELEMENTS ADOPTED 12/19/06 P. 1-256 With these challenges come new opportunities. This is an era of revitalized historic neighborhoods, vibrant new design ideas, and a more sophisticated appreciation of the role that preservation can play 261 in rejuvenating the city. Collaboration and consensus about preservation are largely replacing the antagonistic battles of the past. Preservation will move forward with the policies in this Plan. 1000.6 The District’s Historic Preservation Program The foundation of the District of Columbia historic preservation program is the Historic Landmark and Historic District Protection Act of 1978 (see text box This law establishes the city’s historic preservation review process and its major players, including the Mayor’s Agent, Historic Preservation Review Board (HPRB and Historic Preservation Office (HPO 1000.7 The HPRB has responsibility for the designation of historic landmarks and districts, and for advising the Mayor’s official agent on construction activities affecting historic properties. The HPO is a component of the DC Office of Planning (OP) and serves as both the HPRB staff and the District’s State Historic Preservation Office (SHPO) for the purposes of the federal historic preservation programs established by the National Historic Preservation Act of 1966 (16 U.S.C. § 470 Under federal law, the SHPO is responsible for preservation planning, review of federal projects, survey and registration of historic properties, administration of preservation tax credits, and educational programs. 1000.8 The mission of the District’s preservation program is to foster the wise stewardship of historic and cultural resources through planning, protection, and public education. This is achieved through the identification and designation of historic properties, review of their treatment, and engagement with the public using a variety of tools to promote awareness, understanding, and enjoyment of the city’s historic environment. 1000.9 The preservation program and policies in this plan are premised on the following basic assumptions: Historic properties are finite, non-renewable community resources, the preservation, protection, and enjoyment of which are essential to the public welfare. When historic or archeological resources are destroyed, they are gone forever. Not everything that is old is worth preserving, nor is historic preservation aimed at creating a lifeless and static historical environment To be considered for preservation, a property must be demonstrated significant in history, architecture, or archaeology Historic properties are living assets that were built for use. The goal is to encourage vitality by continuing to use and adapt historic properties for modern needs and attract the necessary financial investment to support these goals. Historic preservation is a source of economic development and growth. Preservation conserves usable resources, stimulates tourism and investment in the local economy, and enhances the value of the civic environment. Preservation benefits and educates everyone. It honors and celebrates our shared history. 1000.10 [BEGIN SIDEBAR] Purposes of the Historic Landmark and Historic District Protection Act of 1978 (DC Code § 6- 1101(a 1000.11 It is hereby declared as a matter of public Policy that the protection, enhancement and perpetuation of properties of historical, cultural and aesthetic merit are in the interests of the health, prosperity and welfare of the people of the District of Columbia. Therefore, this act is intended to: CITYWIDE ELEMENTS COMPREHENSIVE PLAN DISTRICT ELEMENTS ADOPTED 12/19/06 P. 1-257 (1) Effect and accomplish the protection, enhancement and perpetuation of improvements and landscape features of landmarks and districts which represent distinctive elements of the city’s cultural, social, economic, political and architectural history 2) Safeguard the city’s historic, aesthetic and cultural heritage, as embodied and reflected in such 262 landmarks and districts 3) Foster civic pride in the accomplishments of the past 4) Protect and enhance the city’s attraction to visitors and the support and stimulus to the economy thereby provided; and (5) Promote the use of landmarks and historic districts for the education, pleasure and welfare of the people of the District of Columbia. [END SIDEBAR] Historic Preservation Goal 1001 The overarching goal for historic preservation is to: Preserve and enhance the unique cultural heritage, beauty, and identity of the District of Columbia by respecting the historic physical form of the city and the enduring value of its historic structures and places, recognizing their importance to the citizens of the District and the nation, and sharing mutual responsibilities for their protection and stewardship. 1001.1 [PULLQUOTE: The overarching goal for historic preservation is to: Preserve and enhance the unique cultural heritage, beauty, and identity of the District of Columbia by respecting the historic physical form of the city and the enduring value of its historic structures and places, recognizing their importance to the citizens of the District and the nation, and sharing mutual responsibilities for their protection and stewardship.] Policies and Actions HP-1.0 Recognizing Historic Properties 1002 The treasured image of Washington and its wealth of historic buildings and neighborhoods are matched by few other cities in the United States. These assets include the grand and monumental legacies of the L’Enfant and McMillan Plans as well as the social story that is embodied in each of the city’s neighborhoods. The natural beauty of the District of Columbia is also an inseparable part of the city’s historic image. This is a landscape whose inherent attractiveness made it a place of settlement even in prehistoric times. 1002.1 These historic qualities define the very essence of Washington, D.C. and constitute an inheritance that is significant to both the city and the nation. Recognizing its value is an essential duty for those entrusted to pass on this place unharmed to future generations. 1002.2 The first step in protecting this heritage is to recognize what we have. Much of this work has already been done, for the great majority of the city’s most important historic features are widely acknowledged and officially recognized through historic designation. Washington’s monuments are famous and some of its neighborhoods are known to outsiders. But there are hundreds of historic landmarks and dozens of historic districts in the District of Columbia Inventory of Historic Sites, and many of these are likely to be unfamiliar even to native Washingtonians. Future programs must inform the widest possible audience of CITYWIDE ELEMENTS COMPREHENSIVE PLAN DISTRICT ELEMENTS ADOPTED 12/19/06 P. 1-258 these assets, and at the same time safeguard the unheralded properties whose legacy has yet to be understood. 1002.3 Recognition involves more than academic research and field work to identify and document historic properties. It also requires a deliberate effort to educate and inform property owners and the public at large about the nature and the protected status of those features and places whose historic value may not be readily apparent. It is easy to take historic properties for granted through ignorance or disregard. For 263 this reason it is equally important to publicize the value of potential historic properties, while actively seeking official recognition and thus the benefits of legal protection. 1002.4 HP-1.1 Defining Historic Significance 1003 In any urban environment, some historic properties are more significant than others. However, all properties that meet the basic test of significance should be accorded civic respect and protection under the preservation law. It is appropriate for different levels of significance to be reflected in preservation program priorities and actions, but this should not come at the expense of excluding attention to properties of more modest or localized value. 1003.1 Historic significance must encompass multiple aspects of our city’s history and evolution. Native Americans inhabited this land for thousands of years before it was a national capital. Prehistoric sites have been found in all parts of the District, revealing the features that sustained both ordinary and ceremonial life. The remnants of colonial settlement have also been identified and unearthed. Once the city was established, many ethnic and immigrant groups constructed its buildings and developed its culture over the span of two centuries. Some of the structures built and inhabited by these early residents remain today. 1003.2 The land itself, and the plans that have shaped it, are also an essential part of our history. The nation’s founders selected a special place for the federal city. Both northern and southern, the site was a gentle flatland surrounded by a bowl of hills interlaced with broad rivers and streams. This topography allowed for the creation of a brilliant geometric plan with a spectacular array of civic buildings that gives the capital city its unique symbolic profile. 1003.3 Historic preservation also must respond as history evolves. As the pace of change in modern life accelerates, and as more modern properties are lost before their value is fully understood, there is growing awareness of the need to protect the historic properties of the future. History is not static; part of looking forward is continuously redefining what was most significant about the past. 1003.4 Policy HP-1.1.1: The City’s Historic Image Recognize the historic image of the national capital as part of the city’s birthright. After two centuries of growth, the original vision of the city remains strong and remarkable in an increasingly homogenous global world. Over the years this fundamental character has been protected by local and national laws and policies. It must remain inviolate. 1003.5 Policy HP-1.1.2: Defining Significance Broadly Adopt an encompassing approach to historic significance. Recognize the city’s social history as well as its architectural history, its neighborhoods as well as its individual buildings, its natural landscape as well as its built environment, its characteristic as well as its exceptional, and its archaeology as well as its living history. 1003.6 CITYWIDE ELEMENTS COMPREHENSIVE PLAN DISTRICT ELEMENTS ADOPTED 12/19/06 P. 1-259 Policy HP-1.1.3: Cultural Inclusiveness Celebrate a diversity of histories, tracing the many roots of our city and the many cultures that have shaped its development. A multitude of citizens both famous and ordinary wrote its history. Historic preservation should bear witness to the contributions of all these people.1003.7 [SIDEBAR CAPTION: The maps below show the structures still remaining in the District today by their year of construction. 1003.8] Policy HP-1.1.4: The Recent Past Anticipate the need to preserve the record of our own time. Significant structures and settings from 264 the modern era after the Second World War are the products and places of the recent past whose preservation will retell the story of our era for future generations. Evaluation of the recent past should not be colored by current fads or trends but should instead be judged by scholarly research and documentation after sufficient time has passed to develop an objective historical context. 1003.9 HP-1.2 Identifying Potential Historic Properties 1004 A long-range goal of the historic preservation program is the completion of a comprehensive survey to identify historic resources in the District of Columbia. Over the past 30 years, community sponsors have surveyed many of the District’s older neighborhoods with support from the city’s preservation program. A database of nearly a century’s worth of building permits is in progress, and a photographic inventory of the city’s buildings is also available through the District’s Master Address Repository. Thematic studies and directories of historical architects and builders also help the survey work. Yet much remains to complete this massive task.

It promotes understanding and appreciation of historic properties, allowing communities to take pride in their past and residents to value the history of their own homes. Better information about potential historic property also provides greater certainty to property developers contemplating major investment decisions, thus lessening the potential for conflict over demolition and redevelopment. 1006.1 [PULLQUOTE: Broad public awareness of historic properties promotes understanding and appreciation of historic properties, allowing communities to take pride in their past and residents to value the history of their own homes.] CITYWIDE ELEMENTS COMPREHENSIVE PLAN DISTRICT ELEMENTS ADOPTED 12/19/06 P. 1-264 Policy HP-1.4.1: Publication of the DC Inventory of Historic Sites Maintain the DC Inventory of Historic Sites and a map depicting the location of historic landmarks and districts.

For many tourists the marble monuments, rows of museums, and flowering cherry trees define the city. These images are also cherished by the city’s residents, but they are not the only view of historic Washington. 1007.1 Most of the city spreads far beyond its monumental core and out to the boundaries of the District of Columbia. The city’s business center is richly endowed with lively commercial architecture and blessed by its unique mid-rise scale. Local Washington is a mosaic of neighborhoods—some filled with turreted Victorian rowhouses, some with modest bungalows intermixed with apartments, and others lined block after block with broad turn-of-the-century front porches. Washington’s architecture is an eclectic mix that belies the dignified uniformity of the tourist postcards. And much of the historic city is still intact. This is a prime source of the city’s charm and an inheritance that should make all Washingtonians proud. 1007.2 The protection of these historic properties is by far the most resource-intensive function of the city’s historic preservation program. Protection functions are an integral part of the community planning, development review, and permitting processes shared among several agencies, and they are often the means by which ordinary citizens come into contact with the Historic Preservation Office. Broadly speaking, protection functions include developing effective preservation tools through preservation planning, ensuring the use of proper rehabilitation standards and preservation techniques through building permit review, and promoting compatible new design in historic neighborhoods through the development review process. 1007.3 Historic properties receive their most important official protection under both District and federal law. Under the D.C. Historic Protection Act, before a building permit can be issued to demolish or alter the exterior appearance of a historic property, the application must be submitted to the Historic Preservation Review Board (or in some cases, notably in Georgetown, to the Commission of Fine Arts—see text box at left) for a review to determine whether the proposed work is compatible with the character of the historic property. Similar reviews are required for subdivision of historic property or new construction on the property. These reviews are conducted at various levels of complexity, with the most significant projects involving open public meetings where interested groups and individuals may participate. 1007.4 Under the National Historic Preservation Act, federal agencies must consider the effect of their projects on designated or eligible historic properties. This review occurs in a consultation process with the State Historic Preservation Officer and is known as Section 106 review. Other interested parties are invited to participate in this process. The same consultation is required for District government or private projects funded or licensed by a federal agency. In Section 106 review, the SHPO applies the Secretary of the Interior’s Standards for the Treatment of Historic Properties and the Secretary’s Standards for Rehabilitation to ensure that work on historic properties is consistent with their historic character. 1007.5 CITYWIDE ELEMENTS COMPREHENSIVE PLAN DISTRICT ELEMENTS ADOPTED 12/19/06 P. 1-266 [BEGIN SIDEBAR] U.S. Commission of Fine Arts 1007.6 The Commission of Fine Arts was established by Congress in 1910 as an independent agency to 270 advise the federal and District governments on matters of art and architecture that affect the appearance of the nation's capital.

The following policies promote District government stewardship in preservation. 1008.1 Policy HP-2.1.1: Protection of District-Owned Properties Sustain exemplary standards of stewardship for historic properties under District ownership or control. Use historic properties to the maximum extent feasible when adding new space for government activities, promote innovative new design, and ensure that rehabilitation adheres to the highest preservation standards. Properly maintain both designated and eligible historic properties and protect them from deterioration and inappropriate alteration. 1008.2 Policy HP-2.1.2: Disposition of District-Owned Properties Evaluate District-owned properties for historic potential before acting on disposition. When disposal of historic properties is appropriate, ensure their continued preservation through transfer to a suitable new steward under conditions that ensure their protection and reuse. 1008.3 Policy HP-2.1.3: Interagency Cooperation Develop and strengthen supportive working relationships between the Historic Preservation Office (HPO) and other District agencies. Maintain the role of the HPO as an integral component of the Office of Planning and as a resource to assist other District agencies in evaluating the effect of their undertakings on historic properties. 1008.4 Policy HP-2.1.4: Coordination with the Federal Government Coordinate District historic preservation plans and programs with those of the federal government through processes established under the National Historic Preservation Act, and through close coordination with federal landholders and key agencies like the National Capital Planning Commission, Commission of Fine Arts, and National Park Service. 1008.5 Action HP-2.1-A: Protection of District-Owned Properties Adopt and implement procedures to ensure historic preservation review of District actions at the earliest possible stage of project planning.

Rehabilitate these civic assets and enhance their inherent value with new construction or renovation that sustains the city’s tradition of high quality municipal design. 1008.8 Action HP-2.1-D: Protecting Public Space in Historic Districts Develop guidelines for government agencies and utilities so that public space in historic districts is designed and maintained as a significant and complementary attribute of the district. These guidelines should ensure that such spaces are quickly and accurately restored after invasive work by utilities or the city. 1008.9 HP-2.2 Preservation Planning 1009 The District’s Historic Preservation Office is a component of the Office of Planning and leads preservation planning efforts on several levels—by preparing the District of Columbia Historic Preservation Plan, participating in comprehensive and neighborhood planning projects, and coordinating on major initiatives with federal government agencies like the National Capital Planning Commission and the Advisory Council on Historic Preservation (see text box As the State Historic Preservation Office for the District, HPO is responsible for ensuring that preservation is integrated with the city’s planning efforts. 1009.1 [BEGIN SIDEBAR] Advisory Council on Historic Preservation 1009.3 The Advisory Council on Historic Preservation (ACHP) is an independent federal agency that promotes the preservation, enhancement, and productive use of historic resources. ACHP is charged with encouraging federal agencies to act as responsible stewards of historic property and to factor historic preservation into the requirements for federal projects. In its role as Policy advisor to the President and Congress, ACHP advocates full consideration of historic values in federal decision-making, recommends administrative and legislative improvements to protect the national heritage, and reviews agency programs and policies to promote effectiveness, coordination, and consistency with national preservation policies.

Identify specific historic preservation concerns through consultation with the HPO as an integral member of the planning team. 1009.7 Action HP-2.2-C: Incorporating Preservation Issues in Local Initiatives Include the historic preservation community in broader urban initiatives, such as those relating to housing, transportation, the environment, and public facilities. The Historic Preservation Office and preservation groups should be involved in meetings to discuss relevant issues relating to zoning, transportation, open space, waterfronts, public facilities, public property disposition, and other planning and urban design matters. 1009.8 [Photo Caption: Historic Lincoln Theater] HP-2.3 The Historic Plan of Washington 1010 The Plan of the City of Washington drawn by Pierre L’Enfant in 1791 has served as an enduring symbol and armature for growth of the national capital. More than two centuries of public and private building construction have given shape to the plan. Great civic works and public art have embellished it. After its first hundred years, the plan was reinvigorated according to City Beautiful principles in the McMillan Plan of 1901. Regulated building heights and mandated design review by agencies like the Commission of Fine Arts further supported its enhancement and embellishment. 1010.1 The design principles of the Plan informed the platting of streets and parks in new neighborhoods as the city expanded beyond its initial boundaries. Despite alterations and intrusions, it still serves as the basis for the Legacy Plan adopted in 1997 by the National Capital Planning Commission for the 21st Century. 1010.2 Policy HP-2.3.1: The Plan of the City of Washington Preserve the defining features of the L’Enfant and McMillan plans for Washington. Work jointly with federal agencies to maintain the public squares, circles, and major reservations as landscaped open spaces 273 that provide a means to experience the legacy of the city plan. Preserve the historic pattern of streets and associated minor reservations, and protect these historic rights-of-way from incompatible incursions and intrusions. 1010.3 CITYWIDE ELEMENTS COMPREHENSIVE PLAN DISTRICT ELEMENTS ADOPTED 12/19/06 P. 1-269 Policy HP-2.3.2: Historic Image of the City Protect and enhance the views and vistas, both natural and designed, which are an integral part of Washington’s historic image. Preserve the historic skyline formed by the region’s natural features and topography and its historically significant buildings and monuments from intrusions such as communication antennas and water towers. Preserve the horizontal character of the national capital through enforcement of the 1910 Height of Buildings Act. 1010.4 Policy HP-2.3.3: Spatial Character of L’Enfant Plan Streets Protect the generous open space and reciprocal views of the L’Enfant Plan streets, avenues, and reservations. Protect the integrity and form of the L’Enfant system of streets and reservations from inappropriate new buildings and physical incursions. Support public and private efforts to provide and maintain street trees to help frame axial views and reinforce the city’s historic landscape character. 1010.5 Policy HP-2.3.4: Public Space Design in the L’Enfant Plan Reinforce the historic importance and continuity of the streets as public thoroughfares through sensitive design of sidewalks and roadways. Avoid inappropriate traffic channelization, obtrusive signage and security features, and other physical intrusions that obscure the character of the historic street network. Work jointly with federal agencies to preserve the historic statuary and other civic embellishments of the L’Enfant Plan parks, and where appropriate extend this tradition with new civic art and landscape enhancements of the public reservations. 1010.6 Policy HP-2.3.5: Enhancing Washington’s Urban Design Legacy Adhere to the design principles of the L’Enfant and McMillan Plans in any improvements or alterations to the city street plan. Where the character of the historic plan has been damaged by intrusions and disruptions, promote restoration of the plan through coordinated redevelopment and improvement of the transportation network and public space. 1010.7 Action HP-2.3-A: Review of Alterations to the Historic City Plan Ensure early consultation with the Historic Preservation Review Board and other preservation officials whenever master plans or proposed redevelopment projects envision alterations to the features of the historic city plan. 1010.8 Action HP-2.3-B: Review of Public Improvements Ensure an appropriate level of consultation with the State Historic Preservation Officer before undertaking the design and construction of public space improvements in the L’Enfant Plan area and the public parks of the McMillan Plan. 1010.9 See the Urban Design Element for additional policies and actions on historic plans for the District of Columbia HP-2.4 Review of Rehabilitation and New Construction 1011 Historic properties have generated record levels of rehabilitation and construction activity in the District of Columbia in recent years, and this trend is expected to continue. Whether these projects are modest home improvements reviewed by HPO as a day-to-day customer service, major development projects involving extensive HPRB review (see text box on next page requests to certify work for tax credits, or 274 monumental new federal buildings, all involve the application of similar preservation and design principles. These principles recognize that historic environments need to grow and evolve as cities constantly change. 1011.1 CITYWIDE ELEMENTS COMPREHENSIVE PLAN DISTRICT ELEMENTS ADOPTED 12/19/06 P. 1-270 [BEGIN SIDEBAR] Historic Preservation Review Board 1011.8 The District of Columbia Historic Preservation Review Board (HPRB) is a group of private citizens appointed by the Mayor to represent professional and community viewpoints in the historic preservation process. HPRB professional members meet the Secretary of the Interior’s preservation qualifications and represent expertise in architecture, architectural history, history, and archaeology. HPRB advises the Mayor under the District law and the SHPO on matters authorized by the National Historic Preservation Act. [END SIDEBAR] The District preservation law (Act 2-144) is the basis for review of most preservation projects, but others are considered under the federal Section 106 process or the preservation tax incentive program. The Act establishes that the test for alterations/ additions and new construction is “compatibility with the character of the historic district.” Coordination with cooperating agencies—the Commission of Fine Arts and its Old Georgetown Board, the National Capital Planning Commission, and the National Park Service—is a key factor in this review. Whether applying District or federal standards, the city’s preservation officials encourage an approach to rehabilitation and architectural design based on the premise of compatibility with the historic context. This does not mean that additions or new construction should try to mimic historic buildings, but rather should achieve harmony with the historic surroundings through basic good design and close attention to the characteristics and design principles of the historic environment. Good contemporary architecture can fit within this context; in fact, it is necessary in an evolving and dynamic city and is welcomed as an expression of our time. 1011.2 Compatibility with the historic environment also means that new construction should be suited to the fundamental character and the relative importance of a wide range of historic buildings and environments. Delicate historic environments like a quiet residential street demand design restraint at a uniform scale, while more robust historic environments can sustain stronger design statements and more striking juxtapositions of scale—high-style and densely packed downtown, or daring and cutting-edge on an industrial waterfront. 1011.3 Policy HP-2.4.1: Rehabilitation of Historic Structures Promote appropriate preservation of historic buildings through an effective design review process. Apply design guidelines without stifling creativity, and strive for an appropriate balance between restoration and adaptation as suitable for the particular historic environment. 1011.4 Policy HP-2.4.2: Adaptation of Historic Properties for Current Use Maintain historic properties in their original use to the greatest extent possible. If this is no longer feasible, encourage appropriate adaptive uses consistent with the character of the property. 1011.5 275 Policy HP-2.4.3: Compatible Development Preserve the important historic features of the District while permitting compatible new infill development. Within historic districts, preserve the established form of development as evidenced by lot coverage limitations, yard requirements open space, and other standards that contribute to the character and attractiveness of those areas. Ensure that new construction, repair, maintenance, and improvements are in scale with and respect historic context through sensitive siting and design and the appropriate use of materials and architectural detail.1011.6 CITYWIDE ELEMENTS COMPREHENSIVE PLAN DISTRICT ELEMENTS ADOPTED 12/19/06 P. 1-271 Policy HP-2.4.4: Suitability to the Historic Context Apply design standards in a manner that accounts for different levels of historic significance and different types of historic environments. Encourage restoration of historic landmarks while allowing enhancements of equivalent design quality, provided such enhancements do not damage the landmark. Exercise greater restraint in residential historic districts and areas with a clear prevailing development pattern or architectural style. Allow greater flexibility where the inherent character of historic properties can accommodate greater intervention or more dramatic new design, for example, in non-residential areas and in areas without a significant design pattern. 1011.7 Policy HP-2.4.5: Protecting Historic Building Integrity Protect historic buildings from demolition whenever possible, and protect the integrity of whole buildings. Discourage treatments like facadism or relocation of historic buildings, allowing them only when there is no feasible alternative for preservation, and only after a finding that the treatment is necessary in the public interest. Waivers or administrative flexibility should be provided in the application of building and related codes to permit maximum preservation and protection of historic resources while ensuring the health and safety of the public. 1011.9 Policy HP-2.4.6: Preservations Standards for Zoning Review [Note: this was formerly Action HP- 2.4-C] Ensure consistency between zoning regulations and design standards for historic properties. Zoning for each historic district shall be consistent with the predominant height and density of contributing buildings in the district. Where needed, specialized standards or regulations should be developed to help preserve the characteristic building patterns of historic districts and minimize design conflicts between preservation and zoning controls. 1011.10 Action HP-2.4-A: Conceptual Design Review Process Sustain and improve the conceptual design review process as the most effective and most widely used means to promote good preservation and compatible design. Support the use of this process by property owners and developers by committing sufficient resources and appointing highly qualified professionals to the Historic Preservation Review Board. Enhance public participation and transparency in the process through increased use of electronic means to provide public notice, process applications, and post documents for public review. 1011.11 Action HP-2.4-B: Design Standards and Guidelines Expand the development of design standards and guidelines for the treatment and alteration of historic 276 properties, and for the design of new buildings subject to preservation design review. Ensure that these tools address appropriate treatment of characteristics specific to particular historic districts. Disseminate these tools widely and make them available on the Internet. 1011.12 Action HP-2.4-C: Zone Map Amendments in Historic Districts Identify areas within historic districts that may be “overzoned” based on the scale and height of contributing buildings, and pursue rezoning of such areas with more appropriate designations. 1011.13 HP-2.5 Historic Landscapes and Open Space 1012 More than almost any other feature, the exceptional width and openness of Washington’s parks and streets define the basic character of the city. These spaces include the major monumental greenswards of the Mall, riverfront and stream valley parks, and the green space of estates, cemeteries, and campuses.

Take special care at historic landmarks and in historic districts to protect this public environment from intrusions, whether from excess paving, vehicular access and parking, high walls and fencing, or undue disruption of the natural contours or bermed terraces. 1012.5 Policy HP-2.5.5: Public Campuses Recognize campuses in federal ownership as both historic landscape settings for important government 277 facilities and as open green space for the entire city. Preserve the communal value of these campuses by protecting them from overdevelopment. Balance any new development against the public interest in retaining open green space. 1012.6 Policy HP-2.5.6: Historic Open Space Retain landscaped yards, gardens, estate grounds, and other significant areas of green space associated with historic landmarks whenever possible. If development is permitted, retain sufficient open space to protect the setting of the historic landmark and the integrity of the historic property. In historic districts, strive to maintain shared open space in the interior of blocks while balancing the need to accommodate reasonable expansion of residential buildings. 1012.7 Action HP-2.5-A: Protecting Historic Landscapes Promote the protection of historic landscapes through documentation, specific recognition in official designations, and public education materials. Work cooperatively with federal and city agencies and private landowners to promote the preservation of historic landscapes as integral components of historic CITYWIDE ELEMENTS COMPREHENSIVE PLAN DISTRICT ELEMENTS ADOPTED 12/19/06 P. 1-273 landmarks and districts, and to ensure that new construction is compatible with the setting of historic properties. 1012.8 Action HP-2.5-B: Protecting the Natural Escarpment Protect views of and from the natural escarpment around central Washington by working with District and federal land-holders and review agencies to accommodate reasonable demands for new development on major historic campuses like Saint Elizabeths Hospital, the Armed Forces Retirement Home, and McMillan Reservoir in a manner that harmonizes with the natural topography and preserves important vistas over the city. 1012.9 Action HP-2.5-C: Protecting Rights-Of-Way Promote the preservation of original street patterns in historic districts by maintaining public rights- ofway and historic building setbacks. Retain and maintain alleys in historic districts where they are significant components of the historic development pattern. 1012.10 HP-2.6 Archaeological Resources 1013 Washington has been the home of successive generations stretching far back in time. The artifacts and man-made features uncovered through archaeological investigation are important evidence of the city’s history, its colonial origins, and its prehistoric past. These resources often illustrate aspects of past lives that are not visible in documents or in the built environment. They can illuminate what has been long forgotten about everyday life. And often in the most touching and personal way, they can help connect us to the lives of those who preceded us. 1013.1 [Photo Caption: Prehistoric tools dating to 2000 B.C. were discovered during an archaeological survey project at Barney Circle. Research determined the site was used as a temporary campsite for toolmaking.] Policy HP-2.6.1: Protection of Archeological Sites Retain archeological resources in place where feasible, taking appropriate steps to protect sites from unauthorized disturbance. If sites must be excavated, follow established standards and guidelines for the treatment of archaeological resources, whether in documentation and recordation, or in the collection, 278 storage and protection of artifacts. 1013.2 Policy HP-2.6.2: Curation of Data and Artifacts Treat archaeological artifacts as significant civic property.

Ensure public access to these materials and promote research using the collections and records. 1013.5 Action HP-2.6-B: Archaeological Surveys and Inventories Increase surveys, inventories, and other efforts to identify and protect significant archeological resources. 1013.6 CITYWIDE ELEMENTS COMPREHENSIVE PLAN DISTRICT ELEMENTS ADOPTED 12/19/06 P. 1-274 Action HP-2.6-C: Archaeological Site Reports Require prompt completion of site reports that document archaeological findings after investigations are undertaken. Maintain a central archive of these reports and increase efforts to disseminate their findings and conclusions. 1013.7 HP-2.7 Enforcement 1014 The enforcement program carries the District’s preservation process to completion by ensuring that work on landmarks and in the city’s many historic districts is consistent with preservation goals. The historic preservation inspectors ensure compliance with HPO approvals and work with citizens and neighborhood groups to curtail illegal construction activity. 1014.1 Policy HP-2.7.1: Preservation Law Enforcement Protect historic properties from unauthorized building activity, physical damage, and diminished integrity through systematic monitoring of construction and vigilant enforcement of the preservation law. Use enforcement authority, including civil fines, to ensure compliance with the conditions of permits issued under the preservation law. 1014.2 Policy HP-2.7.2: Prevention of Demolition by Neglect Prevent demolition of historic buildings by neglect or active intent through enforcement of effective regulations, imposition of substantial civil fines, and when necessary, criminal enforcement proceedings against those responsible. 1014.3 Action HP-2.7-A: Preservation Enforcement Improve enforcement of preservation laws through a sustained program of inspections, imposition of appropriate sanctions, and expeditious adjudication. Strengthen interagency cooperation and promote compliance with preservation laws through enhanced public awareness of permit requirements and procedures. 1014.4 Action HP-2.7-B: Accountability for Violations Hold both property owners and contractors accountable for violations of historic preservation laws or regulations, and ensure that outstanding violations are corrected before issuing permits for additional work. Ensure that fines for violations are substantial enough to deter infractions, and take the necessary action to ensure that fines are collected. 1014.5 279 HP-3.0 Capitalizing on Historic Properties 1015 For a city like Washington, DC, protection of historic resources is an integral part of the community planning, economic development, and construction permitting processes. Historic preservation is an important local government function as well as an economic development strategy. 1015.1 Historic preservation is also fundamental to the growth and development of District neighborhoods. Recent building permit and development activity in the city confirms that historic preservation is a proven catalyst for neighborhood investment and stabilization. The financial impact of preservation on the city is also well documented. Preservation has increased real estate values, strengthened the city’s tourism industry, and revitalized neighborhood shopping districts like Barracks Row and U Street. Looking to the future, historic preservation will become even more closely integrated with urban design, neighborhood conservation, housing, economic development, tourism, and planning strategies. 1015.2 CITYWIDE ELEMENTS COMPREHENSIVE PLAN DISTRICT ELEMENTS ADOPTED 12/19/06 P. 1-275 [PULLQUOTE: Historic preservation has increased real estate values, strengthened the city’s tourism industry, and revitalized neighborhood shopping districts like Barracks Row and U Street.] Of particular concern for historic preservation are the estimated two-thirds of the city’s residential buildings that were built before 1950. Real estate pressure on this housing stock and the traditional character of historic neighborhoods is substantial. The city also anticipates major redevelopment over the next two decades along the Anacostia River and in large under-developed tracts throughout the city. Many of these sites contain historic properties or are likely to have significant impact on nearby historic districts. 1015.3 Whether as an economic opportunity or a set of new challenges, historic preservation needs strong advocates to promote its importance among the host of priorities facing community leaders. Preservation draws strength by forging effective partnerships and ensuring the development of preservation leaders for the future. 1015.4 HP-3.1 Preservation Incentives 1016 Financial incentives are beneficial and sometimes necessary as a means of achieving preservation of historic properties. Incentives can also help to preserve affordable housing and protect neighborhood diversity. Existing preservation incentives include the federal Historic Preservation Tax Credits and New Market Tax Credits. District programs include a Revolving Fund Loan Program and the new Targeted Historic Homeowner Tax Credit. 1016.1 Policy HP-3.1.1: Preservation Incentives Develop and maintain financial incentives to support preservation of historic properties in private ownership. Give priority to programs to assist owners with low and moderate incomes. 1016.2 Policy HP-3.1.2: Incentives for Special Property Types Develop specialized incentives to support preservation of historic properties like schools, places of worship, theaters, and other prominent historic structures of exceptional communal value. Use a variety of tools to reduce development pressure on these resources and to help with unusually high costs of maintenance. 1016.3 Action HP-3.1-A: D.C. Preservation Incentives Implement and promote the District’s new targeted homeowner incentive program through an active program of outreach and public information. Monitor and evaluate the program to assess its effectiveness and to guide the development of other appropriate incentives and assistance programs. 1016.4 Action HP-3.1-B: TDR Benefits for Preservation Evaluate the effectiveness of existing transfer of development rights (TDR) programs, and consider 280 revisions to enhance their utility for preservation. 1016.5 See the Land Use Element for additional policies and actions on row house preservation. HP-3.2 Preservation and Economic Development 1017 Investment in historic preservation is a major source of economic development for Washington. Historic districts promote stable communities by giving residents a voice in guiding new development. Older buildings provide space to incubate new businesses. The quality of life in historic neighborhoods helps to attract new residents. 1017.1 CITYWIDE ELEMENTS COMPREHENSIVE PLAN DISTRICT ELEMENTS ADOPTED 12/19/06 P. 1-276 [PULLQUOTE: Historic districts promote stable communities by giving residents a voice in guiding new development. Older buildings provide space to incubate new businesses. The quality of life in historic neighborhoods helps to attract new residents.] In recent years the District’s preservation program has processed more than 4,000 building permit and related applications annually, representing more than 1/3 of the construction permits issued by the District each year. The magnitude of this effort testifies equally to the extent of ongoing repair and rehabilitation of historic buildings, the importance of historic assets as generators of economic activity, and the importance of the HPRB review process in supporting high quality new development in the city. The following policies and actions address the importance of historic preservation as a factor in the city’s economic growth and development: 1017.2 Policy HP-3.2.1: Preservation and Community Development Promote historic preservation as a tool for economic and community development. 1017.3 Policy HP-3.2.2: Preservation and Neighborhood Identity Recognize the potential for historic preservation programs to protect and enhance the distinct identity and unique attractions of District neighborhoods. 1017.4 Policy HP-3.2.3: Neighborhood Revitalization Utilize historic preservation programs and incentives to encourage historic preservation as a revitalization strategy for neighborhoods and neighborhood business districts. 1017.5 Action HP-3.2-A: Historic Neighborhood Revitalization Implement preservation development strategies through increased use of proven programs and initiatives sponsored by preservation leaders like the National Trust for Historic Preservation, National Park Service, and others. Make full use of the programs available through the National Main Street Center, Preservation Services Fund, Preserve America, Save America’s Treasures, and other programs designed for the recognition of diverse cultural heritage and the preservation and promotion of historic landmarks and districts. 1017.6 HP-3.3 Preservation Partnerships and Advocacy 1018 The foundation of a strong preservation program is an informed and participatory public that understands why historic preservation is important, how it is achieved, and what benefits it can provide. Strong preservation partnerships not only promote the values of preservation but also serve to forge a greater sense of community. Partnerships with the public are critical to any preservation program and must be established and advanced through education and outreach. 1018.1 Policy HP-3.3.1: Promotion of Historic Preservation Use historic preservation to foster civic pride and strengthen communal values. Increase public awareness of historic preservation, promote appreciation of historic places, and support preservation 281 activities of interest to residents and visitors. 1018.2 Policy HP-3.3.2: Public Education Promote public education in the values of historic preservation and the processes for preserving historic properties. 1018.3 CITYWIDE ELEMENTS COMPREHENSIVE PLAN DISTRICT ELEMENTS ADOPTED 12/19/06 P. 1-277 Policy HP-3.3.3: Preservation Advocacy Encourage public participation in historic preservation through strong community partnerships. Promote communication and collaboration among the city’s preservation groups in advocating for preservation goals. Involve historical societies, academic organizations, and others with specialized knowledge of the District’s history and historic resources in efforts to promote historic preservation. 1018.4 Policy HP-3.3.4: Cultural Tourism Celebrate the cultural history of District neighborhoods. Recognize cultural preservation as an integral part of historic preservation, and use cultural tourism to link neighborhoods and promote communication between diverse groups. 1018.5 Policy HP-3.3.5: Special Events for Preservation Promote preservation awards, festivals, conferences, exhibitions, and other special events that raise awareness of historic preservation and celebrate the District’s history and historic places. 1018.6 Action HP-3.3-A: Preservation Outreach and Education Sustain an active program of outreach to the District’s neighborhoods. Develop educational materials on the cultural and social history of District communities as a means to engage residents and introduce historic preservation values and goals. Promote public understanding of not just the principles for preserving properties but also the social and community benefits of historic preservation. 1018.7 Action HP-3.3-B: Historic Preservation in Schools Work with both public and private schools to develop and implement programs to educate District students on the full range of historic, architectural, and archaeological resources in Washington. Use education to promote the value of historic preservation as a community activity. 1018.8 Action HP-3.3-C: Historic and Archaeological Exhibitions Develop display exhibits for libraries, recreation centers, and other public buildings that showcase historic and archaeological resources. Recruit volunteers to assist with the interpretation of these resources. 1018.9 Action HP-3.3-D: Heritage Tourism Identify heritage tourism opportunities and strategies that integrate District programs with those of organizations like Cultural Tourism DC, the DC Convention and Visitors Bureau, and others oriented to visitors. Use these programs to promote and enhance the integrity and authenticity of historic resources. 1018.10 Action HP-3.3-E: Coordinated Preservation Advocacy Encourage and facilitate interaction between preservation and economic development interests. Strengthen working relationships among the HPO, HPRB, Advisory Neighborhood Commissions, and preservation organizations. Establish special task forces or advisory groups as appropriate to support preservation programs and advocacy for historic preservation. 1018.11 CITYWIDE ELEMENTS COMPREHENSIVE PLAN DISTRICT ELEMENTS ADOPTED 12/19/06 P. 1-278 CHAPTER 11 COMMUNITY SERVICES AND FACILITIES ELEMENT Overview 1100 The Community Services and Facilities Element provides policies and actions on health care 282 facilities, child care and senior care facilities, libraries, police stations, fire stations, and other municipal facilities such as maintenance yards. A well-balanced and adequate public facility system is a key part of the city’s drive to sustain and enhance the quality of life for its residents. 1100.1 Several District departments and other government agencies are responsible for the planning, management, and oversight of the District’s community services and facilities. This Element incorporates planning and policy guidance from the short-term and long-range plans and programs of these agencies. These agencies must coordinate their capital improvement plans with the District’s land use plans so that the city can continue delivering essential services to existing customers while accommodating projected growth. 1100.2 The critical community services and facilities issues facing the District of Columbia are addressed in this Element. These include: Assessing, rehabilitating, and maintaining facilities and lands to provide efficient delivery of public services to existing and future District residents Investment in and renewal of the public library system Providing facilities to offer affordable and high-quality health care services 1100.3 Other elements of the Plan should be consulted for more direction on road and transit facilities (Transportation Element school facilities (Educational Facilities Element recreation centers (Parks, Recreation, and Open Space Element housing for special needs populations (Housing Element green building practices (Environmental Protection Element job training facilities (Economic Development Element and water, sewer, and drainage (Infrastructure Element 1100.4 Community Services and Facilities Goal 1101 The goal for community services and facilities is as follows: Provide high-quality, accessible, efficiently managed, and properly funded community facilities to support the efficient delivery of municipal services, protect public health and safety, and enhance the well-being of current and future District residents. 1101.1 [PULLQUOTE: Community Services and Facilities Goal: The overarching goal for community services and facilities is as follows: Provide high-quality, accessible, efficiently managed, and properly funded community facilities to support the efficient delivery of municipal services, protect public health and safety, and enhance the well-being of current and future District residents.] CITYWIDE ELEMENTS COMPREHENSIVE PLAN DISTRICT ELEMENTS ADOPTED 12/19/06 P. 1-279 Policies and Actions CSF-1.0 Ensuring Adequate Community Services and Facilities 1102 Planning for adequate community services and facilities requires careful planning and, in some cases, reallocating resources and refocusing priorities. It also requires improved coordination among District agencies and new approaches to the design, funding, and prioritizing of capital improvements. 1102.1 CSF-1.1 Long-Term Planning for Public Facilities 1103 The District Office of Property Management (OPM) is responsible for the management, care, and operation of all District government facilities. These facilities include over 100 government-owned buildings with nearly 5.9 million square feet of floor space, 13 warehouses totaling almost 730,000 square feet, and 35 leased buildings with 4.3 million square feet of floor space. Assets also include 10 parking 283 lots and seven communications towers. The Capital Services Construction Administration Division of the OPM manages and implements a building improvement program for several of the largest District agencies, including the Office of Aging, the Department of Corrections, Fire and Emergency Medical Services, the Department of Health, the Department of Human Services, the Metropolitan Police Department, the DC Public Library, the Department of Public Works, and the University of the District of Columbia. 1103.1 Historically, planning for the facility needs of these agencies has focused on short-term capital needs rather than long-term growth forecasts or demographic analyses. This is partially due to advancing age of many facilities and the overriding emphasis on facility replacement and modernization. Given the poor condition of many public buildings, the city’s focus has been on addressing basic life safety issues such as structural integrity rather than planning more systematically for 10 or 20 year needs. At the same time, planning for community facilities is complicated by blurred jurisdiction—agencies like the Department of Parks and Recreation and the DC Public Schools are responsible for their own capital budgeting and facility planning. While such efforts are coordinated with OPM through the City Administrator, the system is still imperfect. 1103.2 The Comprehensive Plan should be viewed as a tool for improving community facility planning on a number of levels. First, it is underpinned by an analysis of existing facilities that identifies existing gaps, redundancies, and functionally obsolete community facilities. For instance, functionally obsolete facilities can include fire stations that no longer can accommodate modern fire fighting equipment and cannot be modernized. Second, it articulates how and where the city will grow—providing a long-term (20 year) perspective on future needs. Third, it addresses facility planning for multiple agencies. This not only provides for more logical and equitable capital planning, it also presents the opportunity for co- location of multiple services in single facilities. 1103.3 Since land in the District is limited and is a scarce resource, the city needs to make sure that existing land devoted to community facilities is well used and retained for the long-term. This means that land resources should generally be preserved in District ownership if a facility is found to be obsolete, in order to ensure that the city can address current and future needs. Short-term or long-term land leases to private entities are preferred to selling such properties so that the District of Columbia can retain an adequate supply of land for the long-term future. 1103.4 The city must employ a range of techniques and tools to develop community facilities given the high cost and limited supply of land. In addition to financing and constructing facilities itself and co-locating CITYWIDE ELEMENTS COMPREHENSIVE PLAN DISTRICT ELEMENTS ADOPTED 12/19/06 P. 1-280 compatible facilities together, the District uses joint development and public/private ventures to leverage its assets. 1103.5 [BEGIN TEXT BOX] The Big City Dilemma in Community Services and Facilities Planning 1103.6 Planning for new public facilities like libraries and police stations is an important long-range planning activity. In fast-growing suburban cities and counties, such planning usually occurs in tandem with preparation of the Comprehensive Plan, since the need for new facilities correlates directly with 284 growth. The process is different in large, mature cities like Washington. In older cities, public facilities are usually already established, and the issue is typically replacement and modernization rather than the acquisition of new sites. This can lead to disjointed planning practices. As part of the revision of the District Elements, the Comprehensive Plans for several other large US cities were reviewed. A summary of the public facilities provisions in the San Francisco, Atlanta, Seattle, and Baltimore Comp Plans is provided below: In San Francisco, the General Plan provides prescriptive guidance on community facility planning. It sets general criteria for locating police and fire stations, libraries, public health centers, and neighborhoods centers. For example, the plan stipulates that police stations should be accessible by public transit, that fire stations should have a ½ mile service area radius, and that each branch library should serve 25,000-50,000 residents. The Plan does not quantify future community facility needs, and does not provide specific locations for future facilities. Atlanta’s Comprehensive Plan includes a public safety element with policies on police, fire and emergency management services. The policies are generally programmatic and only address specific facility needs in a few cases. For instance, high priority replacement fire stations are listed. The Plan’s Human Services Element discusses the need for child care and health facilities but does not identify specific sites for such facilities. Similarly, recommendations for libraries address capital projects that are already underway rather than long-term needs for new facilities. Baltimore’s recent Comprehensive Plan draft does not address community services and facilities planning for fire, police, library, health and neighborhood centers. The Seattle Comprehensive Plan includes a 20-year growth projection that is very similar in quantity to the District of Columbia’s projection. In the Capital Facilities Element of their Plan, there are several policies relating to the location of new facilities, including policies to target investments to areas expecting the highest levels of residential and employment growth, and to encourage the location of facilities like schools, libraries, and clinics in transit-served urban villages. The capital facilities needed to meet projected needs are included in the city’s Capital Improvement Program rather than in the Comp Plan. [END TEXT BOX] Policy CSF-1.1.1: Adequate Facilities Construct, rehabilitate, and maintain the facilities necessary for the efficient delivery of public services to current and future District residents. 1103.7 Policy CSF-1.1.2: Adequate Land Ensure that the District government owns a sufficient amount of land in appropriately distributed locations to accommodate needed public facilities and meet the long-term operational needs of the government. 1103.8 See also the Land Use Element and Economic Development Element policies and actions to preserve and protect adequate lands for public facilities. CITYWIDE ELEMENTS COMPREHENSIVE PLAN DISTRICT ELEMENTS ADOPTED 12/19/06 P. 1-281 Policy CSF-1.1.3 Retention of Publicly-Owned Land Retain District-owned property for community facility uses. Wherever feasible, the District should use short- or long-term leases for lands not currently needed so as to preserve the District’s long-term supply of land for public use. 1103.9 Policy CSF-1.1.4: Addressing Facilities That Are Functionally Obsolete Develop reuse or disposition plans for public buildings or sites that are functionally obsolete, that cannot be rehabilitated cost-effectively, or that are no longer needed. 1103.10 Policy CSF-1.1.5: Barrier-Free Design Require that all District public facilities accommodate the needs of persons with physical disabilities 285 to the greatest extent possible. 1103.11 Policy CSF-1.1.6: Location of Facilities Ensure that the planning, siting, and design of new public facilities is consistent with all Comprehensive Plan goals and policies, including the Future Land Use Map and the Policy Map. 1103.12 Policy CSF-1.1.7: Public Facilities and Economic Development Locate new public facilities to support economic development and neighborhood revitalization efforts. 1103.13 See the Environmental Protection Element for policies on Green Building requirements for new public facilities and the Urban Design Element for policies on the design of public buildings. [SIDEBAR: “The co-location idea is brilliant! But make it so that small satellite social service offices can use these spaces too, and if at some point the neighborhood changes and they’re not needed, then other uses for their office space could move in.”— Participant in a Comprehensive Plan meeting.] Policy CSF-1.1.8: Co-Location Encourage the co-location of multiple community services in the same facility, provided that the uses are functionally compatible with each other and are also compatible with land uses and activities on surrounding properties. The planning of public facilities such as libraries, police and fire stations, recreation centers, job training centers, early childhood development centers, and wellness centers, shall be fully coordinated to ensure that such facilities are logically and efficiently sited, and support the goal of providing neighborhood-based services. Joint planning of District-operated facilities with other community facilities such as schools, health clinics, and non-profit service centers shall also be supported through ongoing communication and collaboration between the Office of Planning, the DC Public Schools, the Office of Property Management, the City Administrator, the Office of Budget and Planning, other District agencies, and appropriate outside agencies and partners.1103.14 See the Land Use Element for policies related to the siting of community facilities and mitigation of potential impacts. Action CSF-1.1-A: Master Public Facilities Plan Develop a Master Public Facilities Plan (MPFP) to ensure adequate community facilities and infrastructure and to provide guidance for the long-term Capital Improvements Program and the 6- year capital budget. The MPFP should include an assessment of all District-owned or maintained community facilities and property and should identify what improvements are needed to correct deficiencies and address planned growth and change in the District. The facilities plan should be continuously maintained CITYWIDE ELEMENTS COMPREHENSIVE PLAN DISTRICT ELEMENTS ADOPTED 12/19/06 P. 1-282 and updated regularly with new priorities and timelines. As needed, the Comprehensive Plan should be amended to incorporate the MPFP findings and to add newly developed benchmarks and standards, acreage and locational requirements for various public uses, and identification of sites for new or refurbished facilities. As part of the MPFP and for each planning cluster, the appropriate planning agency shall annually collect and publish data on public school capacity and enrollments, recreational facilities, libraries, emergency medical service response time, sewers, green space, public transit capacity including 286 bus routes and ridership statistics for Metrorail stations and lines as well as parking availability, and traffic volumes on roads and at key intersections. This data should be used when evaluating the need for facility and infrastructure improvements, and for evaluating appropriate densities for development in various neighborhoods both in the rezoning process and for planned unit developments. 1103.15 Action CSF-1.1-B: Criteria For Re-Use Establish formal, measurable criteria for determining when a public facility can be deemed surplus, obsolete or too poorly located for its current public use, and therefore subject to a lease agreement for an interim use. Specific criteria should also be developed that spell out the limited circumstances when District-owned community facilities may be sold or traded for other suitable uses. 1103.16 Action CSF-1.1-C: Site Planning Procedures Develop site planning and management procedures that mitigate adverse impacts from public facilities on surrounding areas. 1103.17 CSF-1.2 Funding and Coordination 1104 The District’s Capital Improvement Plan (CIP) includes city-owned facilities (e.g libraries, recreation centers, city offices, parking lots, etc city-owned equipment (e.g police cars, fire trucks, snow removal equipment, etc and transportation infrastructure (e.g roads, bridges, Metro, etc The city can maximize the strategic impact of these large investments by improving coordination, and by linking them to neighborhood revitalization strategies and private investment plans. For example, city investments in transportation may be a key part of stimulating construction of a major new development. Investments in a new community center or school may be a pivotal component of commercial district renovation, and so on. This linkage has often been missing in the past, in part due to the lack of a formalized connection between the Capital Improvement Program and the Comprehensive Plan. 1104.1 [PULLQUOTE: The District’s Capital Improvement Plan (CIP) includes city-owned facilities (e.g libraries, recreation centers, city offices, parking lots, etc city-owned equipment (e.g police cars, fire trucks, snow removal equipment, etc and transportation infrastructure (e.g roads, bridges, Metro, etc ] In 2004, the Council of the District of Columbia adopted legislation giving the District’s Office of Planning the authority to coordinate capital improvement planning, and confirm the consistency of proposed capital improvements with the Comprehensive Plan. This responsibility is currently shared by a “Technical Review Team”, including representatives of about a dozen District agencies involved in public facility planning. In addition, the City Administrator’s Office has led a Master Public Facilities Planning Program to help District agencies assess their facility needs so that capital budgets can be more effectively coordinated. 1104.2 Policy CSF-1.2.1: Capital Improvement Programming Use the capital improvement program process to coordinate the phasing, prioritizing, and funding of public facilities. 1104.3 CITYWIDE ELEMENTS COMPREHENSIVE PLAN DISTRICT ELEMENTS ADOPTED 12/19/06 P. 1-283 Policy CSF-1.2.2: Linking the Comp Plan and Capital Improvement Program Use the District’s Comprehensive Plan, particularly its analysis of growth needs and service adequacy, to establish priorities for the funding of capital improvement projects. Public facility planning should be done systematically and comprehensively and should be based on analytical data about community needs, service levels, and projections—in addition to facility condition assessments. 1104.4 287 Policy CSF-1.2.3: Construction and Rehabilitation Improve the coordination of public facility construction and rehabilitation projects to minimize public costs, maximize community benefits, and avoid service disruption. 1104.5 Policy CSF-1.2.4: Alternative Financing Strategies Develop and apply alternative capital financing and public facility construction techniques, including joint development, creative leasing arrangements, and financing instruments that reduce long-term debt accumulation. 1104.6 Policy CSF-1.2.5: Planning For Maintenance and Operation Develop and fund adequate maintenance budgets for all public facilities based on industry standards. Require an evaluation of projected operating and maintenance (O&amp;amp;M) costs before approving new capital facilities to ensure that sufficient funds will be available for O&amp;amp;M once a new facility is constructed. 1104.7 Policy CSF-1.2.6: Impact Fees Ensure that new development pays its “fair share” of the capital costs needed to build or expand public facilities to serve that development. Consider the use of impact fees for schools, libraries, and public safety facilities to implement this policy. Adoption of any fees shall take potential fiscal, economic, and real estate impacts into account and shall be preceded by the extensive involvement of the development community and the community at large. 1104.8 Action CSF-1.2-A: Capital Projects Evaluation Develop measurable criteria, standards, and systematic coordination procedures to evaluate capital improvement projects. 1104.9 Action CSF-1.2-B: Property Data Base Continually update and expand the District’s property management data base, identifying the location, size, and attributes of all DC-owned facilities and properties. If feasible, develop a publicly accessible online data base displaying this information. 1104.10 CSF-2.0 Health and Human Services 1105 This section of the Community Services and Facilities Element addresses the adequacy, maintenance, and expansion of community health centers as well as the provision and improvement of human service facilities such as child care and senior centers. These facilities are sometimes referred to as a city’s “social infrastructure.” They are just as important to the quality of life as water, sewer, and transportation facilities, and have spatial needs that must be addressed over the coming years. Planning for social infrastructure is complicated by a number of factors, particularly the changing nature of the nation’s health care delivery system and the District’s limited jurisdiction over private service providers. Nonetheless, the Comprehensive Plan can at least state the city’s commitment to provide for an adequate distribution of public facilities across the city, as well as measures to advance public health through the design of the city and protection of the environment. 1105.1 CITYWIDE ELEMENTS COMPREHENSIVE PLAN DISTRICT ELEMENTS ADOPTED 12/19/06 P. 1-284 CSF-2.1 Health Facilities and Services 1106 Access to quality and affordable health care for all its residents is a challenge in the District as it is across the nation. In 2003, 13 percent of District residents were uninsured. Of the remaining 87 percent, 24 percent were covered by Medicaid, 10 percent by Medicare only, and 53 percent through employer or individual insurance programs. 1106.1 The District has been taking steps to expand access to health care. Since 1998, the District has increased 288 the number of people enrolled in Medicaid, the federally and locally funded benefit program, from 112,000 residents to 138,000. In 2002, more than 75 percent of the District’s eligible residents were enrolled in Medicaid. 1106.2 The District has also enrolled more than 20,000 people in the locally funded DC HealthCare Alliance, one of the few programs in the nation that pays for health services for low-income people who do not qualify for Medicaid. 1106.4 Yet, many District residents still have poor health and high rates of chronic disease and disability. In 2003, life expectancy in the District was 68 years, compared to the national average of 76.7 years. The HIV/AIDS rate in the District is ten times the national average. Illnesses like asthma, hepatitis, tuberculosis, and diabetes are also more prevalent in the District than in the nation at large. Some of these disparities are due to higher risk factors in the city, such as obesity, poor nutrition, substance abuse, and violence. But these factors alone do not determine the well-being of District residents. The incidence of serious illness and need for hospitalization can also be reduced through preventive treatment and more effective primary care. Consequently, many of the health care initiatives in the city aim to improve the delivery of affordable primary care services to residents. 1106.5 The Primary Care Administration (PCA) of the District Department of Health is responsible for developing new primary care sites, developing systems to monitor the quality of services provided at health care clinics, and assisting in the physical improvement of clinic space to improve access and increase capacity. The PCA also provides financial assistance for the improvement of existing primary care and community health center facilities. PCA provides subsidies to nonprofit health centers across the District. PCA also co-funds the Medical Homes DC program. In addition, PCA designates Health Professional Shortage Areas, Medically Undeserved Populations (MUP) and Medically Underserved Areas (MUA based on federal standards. 1106.6 According to the District of Columbia Primary Care Association (DCPCA a local nonprofit health care organization, more than half of the District’s residents live in neighborhoods without adequate primary health care facilities or services. Many of the existing community health centers have significant unmet capital needs and do not have access to funds to renovate or replace their facilities. 1106.7 In response to these long-term needs, DCPCA initiated a program called Medical Homes DC in 2003 (see text box The program seeks to enlarge and enhance the current network of community health centers. A “medical home” is a primary care facility where a patient’s health history is known, where a patient is seen regardless of their ability to pay, and where a patient can routinely seek non-emergency care. 1106.8 [BEGIN SIDEBAR] Building a Healthier City: The Medical Homes DC Initiative 1106.9 CITYWIDE ELEMENTS COMPREHENSIVE PLAN DISTRICT ELEMENTS ADOPTED 12/19/06 P. 1-285 Medical Homes DC is an initiative of the DC Primary Care Association designed to improve the quality and effectiveness of primary health centers in the city. The project will serve the uninsured and underinsured residents of the District, many of whom seek primary care at hospital emergency rooms. By reducing avoidable hospitalizations and overcrowding of emergency rooms, Medical Homes DC is 289 intended to reduce overall health care costs. And, by increasing the availability of good primary health care, the initiative should improve the overall health of DC residents. Medical Homes DC works by providing capital grants for facility improvements, as well as technical assistance to participating health centers on a range of matters, including clinical practices, billing, documentation, management oversight and capacity building. A public-private partnership, Medical Homes received a three-year grant from the federal Health Resources Services Administration. The Mayor and Council have also committed $15 million in capital funding. Medical Homes DC launched a competitive process in 2005 to distribute $1 million in construction- related grants for health centers embarking on facility improvement projects. Projects that targeted medically underserved areas of the District were given priority. Nine facilities were selected to receive grants. Collectively, these projects have the potential to create capacity for 125,000 patient visits per year. Fund raising efforts are underway to support future projects. [END SIDEBAR] Hospitals are another important part of the health care delivery system. There are numerous hospitals in the District, including large full-service facilities such as the George Washington University Hospital, Georgetown University Hospital, and the Washington Hospital Center, and more specialized facilities such as Walter Reed Medical Center, which serves the military and family members, the National Rehabilitation Center, and the Psychiatric Institute of Washington. The text box at left includes a list of existing hospitals located within the District of Columbia. 1106.10 The distribution of these facilities across the city is presently uneven, with most hospital beds on the west side of the city and only one full-service hospital east of the Anacostia River. 1106.11 The health care facility policies in the Comprehensive Plan seek to provide a more equitable geographic distribution of community health care facilities throughout the city. The primary means of achieving this goal is the establishment of a comprehensive network of community-based health centers. While some centers already exist, they are often located in outmoded facilities that need to be renovated or replaced. 1106.12 [BEGIN SIDEBAR] Hospitals in the District of Columbia 1106.13 Children's National Medical Center Georgetown University Hospital George Washington University Hospital Greater Southeast Medical Center Hadley Hospital Howard University Hospital National Rehabilitation Hospital Providence Hospital Washington Psychiatric Hospital Sibley Memorial Hospital Walter Reed Army Medical Center Veterans Affairs Medical Center CITYWIDE ELEMENTS 290 COMPREHENSIVE PLAN DISTRICT ELEMENTS ADOPTED 12/19/06 P. 1-286 Washington Hospital Center Hospital for Sick Children Pediatric Center [END SIDEBAR] Policy CSF-2.1.1: Primary and Emergency Care Ensure that high quality, affordable primary health centers are available and accessible to all District residents. Emergency medical facilities should be geographically distributed so that all residents have safe, convenient access to such services.

Coordinate city population and demographic forecasts with health care providers to ensure that their plans are responsive to anticipated growth and socio-economic changes. 1106.18 Policy CSF-2.1.7: Hospices and Long-Term Care Facilities Support the development of hospices and other long-term care facilities for persons with advanced HIV/AIDS, cancer, and other disabling illnesses. 1106.19 Action CSF-2.1-A: Implement Medical Homes DC Work with DCPCA and other partners to implement the recommendations of the Medical Homes DC initiative, including the modernization of primary care facilities and development of new facilities in under-served areas. 1106.20 CSF-2.2 Child Care and Early Childhood Development Centers 1107 The Office of Early Childhood Development (OECD) under the District Department of Human Services provides support for and collaborates with other public and private child and family advocacy organizations to provide services and care for District children up to five years of age. The office also provides access to before and after school services for eligible children up to age 13. It also manages a subsidized child care program for eligible children and families. Waiting lists for child care in the District CITYWIDE ELEMENTS COMPREHENSIVE PLAN DISTRICT ELEMENTS ADOPTED 12/19/06 P. 1-287 reflect a growing demand for services that support parent employment and job productivity, and provide safe learning environments for children. Child care needs are also significant for parents who are employed in the District but live elsewhere. 1107.1 [PULLQUOTE: Waiting lists for child care in the District reflect a growing demand for services that support parent employment and job productivity, and provide safe learning environments for 291 children.] Policy CSF-2.2.1: Adequate Child Care Facilities Allow new and expanded child care facilities in all residential, commercial, and mixed-use areas and in community facilities in an effort to provide adequate affordable childcare facilities throughout the District. Locations should be accessible to public transit. 1107.2 Policy CSF-2.2.2: Child Care Incentives Provide incentives for new and rehabilitated residential and commercial developments to set aside on-site space for child care facilities. 1107.3 Policy CSF-2.2.3: Child Development Centers Recognize the importance of early childhood education and related programs to the well-being of the District’s youth, and support the development of appropriate facilities for these programs. 1107.4 Action CSF-2.2-A: Review And Address Zoning Issues Review and assess the zoning regulations to identify barriers to the development of child care centers in the District. The assessment should consider ways of reducing any barriers that are identified, provided that child safety and neighborhood quality of life issues can be adequately addressed. 1107.5 CSF-2.3 Senior Care 1108 Seniors are expected to be the fastest growing segment of the District’s population during the next 20 years. Although the District’s Office of Aging and several affiliated non-profit organizations already provide a comprehensive system of health care, education, employment, and social services for the District’s elderly population, these entities may be hard pressed to keep up with demand as the number of seniors in the city rises. Currently, about 45 percent of the city’s seniors live alone. Some 43 percent have no personal vehicle and 42 percent have a physical disability. The largest percentages of seniors are in Upper Northwest and Far Northeast. Many are homeowners, caring for their properties with diminished incomes and physical mobility. Others are primary caregivers for their grandchildren, facing the challenge of raising a family in their advancing years. 1108.1 The policies below focus on the importance of senior centers, services, and care facilities. There are currently three senior wellness centers in the city, two in Southeast and one in Northeast. A variety of services and programs are delivered from these facilities, including nutrition, exercise, health care, creative arts, and education. Future investment in senior facilities as well as new facilities will be necessary in the future to serve the District’s growing senior population and to help seniors lead more vital and productive lives. 1108.2 See also the Transportation and Housing Elements for additional policies on seniors Policy CSF-2.3.1: Senior Care Facilities Establish new senior centers in areas that have large elderly populations, particularly neighborhoods in Upper Northwest and Far Northeast. These centers could be co-located in community health facilities or near other public facilities such as libraries or elementary schools to increase the interaction and learning between senior citizens, youth, and others. 1108.3 CITYWIDE ELEMENTS COMPREHENSIVE PLAN DISTRICT ELEMENTS ADOPTED 12/19/06 P. 1-288 CSF-3.0 Libraries and Information Services 1109 As one of world’s leading centers of information and knowledge, the District of Columbia must have a state-of-the-art public library system. A revitalized library system must combine high quality physical buildings with new technology, an expanded Internet presence, inviting public spaces for meetings and gatherings, and programs and collections that meet the needs of all citizens. Our libraries should help children succeed in school, help adults improve their reading skills, and support career advancement and 292 life enrichment goals. The District should aspire to nothing less than greatness as it creates a library system that demonstrates the city’s commitment to meeting the educational and life-long learning needs of all of its residents. 1109.1 The District’s public library system is planned and managed by the District of Columbia Public Library (DCPL an independent agency. The Board of Library Trustees sets policy for DCPL. Its nine members are unpaid District residents appointed by the Mayor and confirmed by the Council for a maximum of two five-year terms. There are currently 27 library facilities, including the central Martin Luther King, Jr. Memorial Library, four community libraries, 21 neighborhood libraries, and one kiosk. 1109.2 The District’s public library system faces many challenges. It lacks the facilities, technology, and collections necessary to deliver the services District residents need. The facility problems are the result of decades of deferred maintenance and the absence of funding for capital improvements. 1109.3 [PULLQUOTE: The District’s public library system faces many challenges. It lacks the facilities, technology, and collections necessary to deliver the services District residents need.] In late 2005, the Mayor’s Task Force on the Future of the District of Columbia Public Library System produced a Blueprint for Change that recommends rebuilding the library system from the ground up. New service priorities are identified, along with a call for new physical facilities, collections, and programming. The Blueprint calls for a new central library to replace the outmoded Martin Luther King, Jr. Memorial Library and a complete overhaul of the branch libraries. The report recommends that the new central library should meet all service priorities and that the branches should be more specialized, with service priorities tailored to address the needs of local residents. 1109.4 CSF-3.1 Library Facilities 1110 Map 11.1 shows the location of DCPL facilities. As noted earlier, the current system includes the central library, 25 branches, and a kiosk. 1110. 1 The Martin Luther King, Jr. Memorial Library was dedicated in 1972 and occupies over 400,000 square feet in a multi-story Downtown structure. It draws users from across the District and also serves as a neighborhood library for residents in its immediate vicinity. It houses the Washingtoniana Room – a repository for local history of the District and its residents. It also houses data from the decennial census dating back to 1800. 1110. 2 [INSERT Map 11.1: DCPL Sites 1110.3] The average age of the branch libraries is 46 years old and there have been no new libraries opened since 1988. Four branch libraries were closed in 2004 for rebuilding as the first phase of a 10 year rebuilding plan. 1110. 4 CITYWIDE ELEMENTS COMPREHENSIVE PLAN DISTRICT ELEMENTS ADOPTED 12/19/06 P. 1-289 Circulation trends in the District reflect the challenges faced by the library system. Recent rankings place the District 15th among 67 large U.S. cities in terms of library circulation and utilization per capita. However, the circulation of materials decreased by 11 percent District-wide between 2001 and 2004. Most of the DCPL’s existing libraries are candidates for replacement due to outdated designs, inability to accommodate modern technology, and general inefficient use of floor space. 1110.5 [PULLQUOTE: Circulation trends in the District reflect the challenges faced by the library system.

One proposal under consideration would relocate the library to the site of the former Washington Convention Center. Regardless of where it is located, the new or modernized central library should support all the services that DCPL provides to District residents, including a literacy center, multi-purpose space, meeting and gathering rooms, and learning stations. 1110.6 Renovation or relocation of the branch libraries presents similar opportunities. A branch library is one of the few local government buildings that residents visit throughout their lifetimes. Each branch should reflect the needs of the residents who use it. Like schools and recreation centers, libraries should be a source of civic pride and a center of community life. The number of branch libraries in the District of Columbia relative to its population is comparable to similarly sized cities as shown in Table 11.1. 1110.7 Table 11.1: Branch Libraries: Number per 1000 Population, Selected Cities 1110.8 City 2000 Population Branch Libraries Branches per 100,000 Population Service Population per Branch DC 572,059 25 4 22,882 Seattle 563,374 23 4 24,495 Boston 589,141 27 5 21,820 San Francisco 776,733 26 3 29,874 Policy CSF-3.1.1: State-of-the-Art Public Library System Ensure that the District has a state-of-the-art Central Library and branch libraries that meet the information and life-long learning needs of District residents. 1110.9 Action CSF-3.1-A: Central Library Relocate or upgrade the central library with a modernized or new central library that includes state- of-theart library services and public space both within and outside the building. The central library should be an architectural civic landmark — a destination and gathering place for residents from across the city. It should provide performance space, display areas for art and exhibitions, and multi-purpose space for meetings and programs. Regardless of its location, the central library should continue to be named in honor of Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. 1110.10 Action CSF-3.1-B: Branch Libraries Completely overhaul, upgrade, or re-build each branch library to provide a safe and inviting space that provides services and programs that address the needs of local residents. Each branch library should be designed to provide a minimum of 20,000 square feet of floor space with a clearly visible entrance and an open, inviting and attractive façade. 1110.11 CITYWIDE ELEMENTS COMPREHENSIVE PLAN DISTRICT ELEMENTS ADOPTED 12/19/06 P. 1-290 Action CSF-3.1-C: Library Funding Explore new dedicated funding sources for the operation and maintenance of each library. This includes annual funding for collections development and programming as well as building repair and maintenance. 1110.12 Action CSF-3.1-D: Archival Storage Include space for storage of archival and historical records for the District of Columbia in the programming and planning of future library facilities. 1110.13 CSF-3.2 Library Location 1111 The opportunity to modernize or relocate more than two dozen branch libraries creates an exciting 294 opportunity for many District neighborhoods. High-quality public libraries can help anchor neighborhood and corridor reinvestment efforts. Libraries can also support many of the other goals articulated in the Comprehensive Plan, including the creation of space for the arts, job training, and literacy programs, and the promotion of high quality civic design. 1111.1 Policy CSF-3.2.1: Location of Branch Libraries Locate branch libraries in a systematic way to maximize access for the greatest number of District residents, including future residents who will reside in planned new neighborhoods. This approach may result in the development of new libraries in growing population centers within the city and the replacement of the substandard “kiosk” type libraries with larger, more appropriately designed facilities. 1111.2 Policy CSF-3.2.2: Public-Private Partnerships for Libraries Explore public-private partnerships to fund the construction of new libraries, including the development of new and remodeled libraries within mixed use projects on existing library sites. In such cases, any redevelopment should conform to the other provisions of this Comprehensive Plan, including the protection of useable neighborhood open space. 1111.3 See also Policy CSF-1.1.8 on public facilities co-location and the Urban Design Element for policies on the design of public facilities. CSF-4.0 Public Safety and Emergency Preparedness 1112 Public safety affects the lives of District residents on several levels. First, despite marked improvements since the 1990s, violent crime remains a fact of life in the District of Columbia. The homicide rate is half what it was 12 years ago, but it is still too high. Violent crime remains a problem in many neighborhoods and substantially reduces the quality of life for law-abiding residents and businesses. 1112.1 Second, fire and emergency medical services are essential to protect life and property, to respond to fires, and to assist residents requiring paramedic help or ambulance transportation. The city’s ability to respond quickly may be compromised as streets become more congested. Competing demands for water and deteriorating infrastructure may also affect firefighting capacity. 1112.2 Third, public safety personnel keep the city functioning during major public events, ranging from inaugurations to demonstrations to street fairs. The operations of District and Capitol Police, transit police, and others are essential to maintaining law and order (see text box at left for an overview of major law enforcement providers in the city 1112.3 CITYWIDE ELEMENTS COMPREHENSIVE PLAN DISTRICT ELEMENTS ADOPTED 12/19/06 P. 1-291 Finally, and perhaps most significantly, public safety has taken on new dimensions with the elevated threat of terrorism. The District’s government institutions, defense interests, and iconic monuments stand out as some of the nation’s most visible symbols. This unique status makes it imperative that the District’s emergency preparedness efforts be better coordinated to anticipate and respond to national security concerns. The District also must be prepared to respond to natural disasters, such as hurricanes, floods, and other extreme weather events, and to hazardous material spills and other accidents. 1112.4 [BEGIN SIDEBAR] Policing the National Capital 1112.5 As the nation’s capital, there are numerous police and security forces besides the MPD with responsibilities for security and law enforcement. Some of the most prominent are: 295 The United States Park Police is a unit of the Department of the Interior, National Park Service. They provide law enforcement services to designated areas within the National Park Service around the country including National Parks Service areas within and around Washington, DC. The US Capitol Police protect the Congress and enforce traffic regulations throughout the large complex of congressional buildings, parks, and roadways around the US Capitol. The United States Secret Service is a unit of the Department of Homeland Security. The Secret Service has primary jurisdiction over the protection of the President, Vice President, their immediate families, other high ranking government officials, and visiting foreign heads of state and government. The Metro Transit Police Department provides a variety of law enforcement and public safety services on the Metrorail and Metrobus systems in the Washington Metropolitan Area. [END SIDEBAR] CSF-4.1 Police Facilities and Services 1113 The Metropolitan Police Department (MPD) is the primary law enforcement agency for the District. The city is divided into seven Police Districts and 46 Police Service Areas (PSAs providing the basic building blocks for community policing. Map 11.2 shows the Police Districts, the PSAs and the location of police stations. Currently, there are seven Police stations, three substations, three Regional Operations Command centers, and three liaison units in the District. 1113.1 Correctional facilities are also an essential part of law enforcement activities. The District of Columbia Jail, which is the District’s primary facility for misdemeanant and pretrial detainees, is located at Reservation 13 east of Capitol Hill. The jail opened in 1976 and is a maximum security facility for males and females. It is managed and operated by the DC Department of Corrections. 1113.2 Change or growth within the District’s neighborhoods including the development of new housing areas will require assessment of MPD facilities and personnel needs. Modernization is needed at all the stations and is being phased to address the most urgent facility needs first. In addition, construction of a new special operations facility and evidence warehouse is needed. 1113.3 Policy CSF-4.1.1: Updated Police Facilities Provide updated and modern police facilities to meet the public safety needs of current and future District residents, businesses, workers, and visitors. 1113.4 [INSERT Map 11.2: Police Stations, Police Districts, and Police Service Areas 1113.5] CITYWIDE ELEMENTS COMPREHENSIVE PLAN DISTRICT ELEMENTS ADOPTED 12/19/06 P. 1-292 CSF-4.2 Fire and Emergency Services 1114 The District’s Fire and Emergency Medical Services Department (FEMS) provides fire protection and medical attention to residents, workers, and visitors in the District of Columbia. It also provides fire protection services to federal facilities in the District. FEMS conducts fire inspections in apartment buildings, businesses, hotels, schools, hospitals, nursing homes, correctional facilities, and residential care facilities to identify and correct potential fire hazards. It is also the primary District agency dealing with hazardous materials (HAZMAT) related incidents. 1114.1 The 33 fire stations in the District include 33 engine companies, 16 ladder companies, three heavy- duty rescue squads, one HAZMAT unit and one fire boat company. Emergency medical units include 13 advanced life support ambulances and 21 basic life support ambulances, and two rapid response units. The Fire and Emergency Medical Services Department has set a minimum standard response time of four 296 minutes for 90 percent of its fire related calls, and eight minutes for 90 percent its critical medical calls. Response time is influenced by the number and location of fire stations, the availability of fire personnel and equipment, and traffic conditions. In 2004, FEMS responded to critical medical calls in eight minutes or less 73 percent of the time and to fire related calls in four minutes or less 91 percent of the time. Map 11.3 shows the location of fire stations in the city. 1114.2 According to FEMS, the current number and distribution of facilities is generally adequate for maintaining the minimum standard response time for new development expected over the next six years. Longer-term facility needs will need to be analyzed during the development of the Public Facilities Master Plan (see Action CSF-1.1-A The Department has identified several needed capital improvement projects to replace, upgrade, and renovate aging fire fighting stations and other facilities such as its training center. The Department also needs to renovate its fleet maintenance yard and find additional space for its headquarters. 1114.3 [PULLQUOTE: According to FEMS, the current number and distribution of facilities is generally adequate for maintaining the minimum standard response time for new development expected over the next six years.

The plan takes an all-hazards approach to disaster response, which means the plan does not address specific scenarios, but can be used in any public emergency situation such as: Natural Hazards—severe weather, hurricanes, tornadoes, flooding, or earthquakes Infrastructure Disruptions—utility and power failures, water supply failures, critical resource shortages, or exploding manhole covers; Human-caused Events and Hazards—urban fires, special events, civil disorder, or transportation accidents; Technological Hazards—hazardous materials, radiological, biological, or computer-related 297 incidents Terrorist Incidents—bomb threats, sabotage, hijacking, or armed insurrection that threatens life or property. Terrorist attacks can also be conduits through which biological, chemical, and radiological agents can be employed. More information on the District Response Plan can be found at http dcema.dc.gov/dcema The Regional Emergency Coordination Plan The Regional Emergency Coordination Plan was developed by the Metropolitan Washington Council of Governments, in partnership with local, state, federal, and private sector organizations, to strengthen regional communication and coordination in the event of a regional incident, disaster, or emergency. At the heart of the Regional Emergency Coordination Plan is a 24/7 communications capability, called the Regional Incident Communication and Coordination System. Local, state, and federal officials can be linked and share information within 30 minutes or less of an emergency. The plan is organized along 15 regional emergency support functions and it parallels the emergency support function structure of the National Response Plan and the District of Columbia Response Plan. More information on the Regional Emergency Coordination Plan can be found at http www.mwcog.org/security/ National Response Plan The National Response Plan establishes a comprehensive approach to enhance the ability of the United States to manage domestic incidents.

It includes policies and actions related to primary, secondary, and higher educational facilities. The Element focuses on the efficient use of school property, and the relationship between schools and the communities that surround them. For District public schools, it focuses on school modernization and the right-sizing of school facilities to meet existing and long- term educational needs. 1200.1 The crucial educational facilities issues facing the District of Columbia are addressed in this Element. These include: Modernizing the District’s public schools to provide a safe and stimulating learning environment for District students; Re-establishing quality schools that are anchors and assets for District neighborhoods; Encouraging university satellite campuses east of the Anacostia River to provide expanded educational opportunities. 1200.2 The District of Columbia Public Schools (DCPS) – in partnership with residents, business-owners and civic organizations has committed to rebuild and re-conceive its public schools. The DCPS Master Education Plan clearly states this renewed commitment: “To provide high-quality teaching and learning in every classroom in every school over the long term, the District of Columbia Public Schools (DCPS) must find sustainable solutions to critical challenges inside and outside our school system. First and foremost, DCPS must regain its place as the school system of choice for children and families in the District of Columbia. We must extend and strengthen our services to all of our student populations, bring young children into the system earlier, serve our special education students within their own neighborhood schools, give all students a strong foundation for learning in the fundamental skills of reading and mathematics, close achievement gaps, expand opportunities for students to excel, and develop effective strategies to keep all of our students in school through high school graduation.” 1200.3 The Educational Facilities Element incorporates the DCPS vision for a new generation of public schools. It recognizes that improving our schools is an important part of the city’s goal of attracting more residents, especially households with children. As recent school construction projects in the District have shown, new schools can become catalysts for private investment and can have a tremendous effect on local growth patterns. More than any other community facility, schools define the social, economic, and physical characteristics of our neighborhoods. 1200.4 299 Because the emphasis of the Comprehensive Plan is on the physical environment, this Element addresses school land and buildings, rather than educational curriculum, teacher quality, school administration and other programmatic issues. Those issues are critically important, but they are addressed by the DCPS Master Education Plan and other DCPS documents.

DCPS is a traditional local education agency with a superintendent and a Board of Education. It is responsible for educating District of Columbia children as well as planning, operating, maintaining, designing, and constructing public school facilities (See the text box on Page 12-4 The Charters are publicly funded schools organized as non-profit corporations and managed by independent Boards of Trustees. 1202.1 In 2006, the DCPS inventory included approximately 150 active schools, serving roughly 56,000 students. District facilities also include administrative buildings, “swing schools” (used for temporarily relocation when campuses are being renovated transportation lots and buildings, and special education facilities. Map 12.1 shows the locations of DCPS school sites. 1202.2 [INSERT Map 12.1: Location of DCPS Schools 1202.3] [BEGIN TEXT BOX] Understanding the Relationship of DC Public Schools to District Government 1202.4 The District of Columbia Public Schools (DCPS) is a charter independent agency within the District of Columbia government. DCPS is led by a Superintendent, who reports to an 11-member Board of Education—the official policy making body for education-related issues in the city. The Board consists of five members elected by the District, four at-large members appointed by the Mayor, and two student representatives. Educational and facilities decisions are made by DCPS. While the District Government does not oversee the school system, it does provide DCPS with its annual capital and operating funds and thus has some influence over these decisions. Each year, the Chief Financial Officer for the District of Columbia Public Schools proposes an annual budget to the Mayor. After the budget is approved by the DC Council, it is submitted to the US Congress for federal approval. Congress passes a yearly resolution approving 300 the District’s annual operating budget and allocates the necessary funds. CITYWIDE ELEMENTS COMPREHENSIVE PLAN DISTRICT ELEMENTS ADOPTED 12/19/06 P. 1-297 DCPS manages its own property but may not sell it. If a school or administrative building is deemed surplus (a procedure that must be completed with approval of the Board of Education the property reverts to the District’s Office of Property Management for disposal. The Superintendent of Schools and the Board of Education are also responsible for developing plans for the delivery of educational services. The Board adopts a Master Education Plan (MEP) that contains policies on topics such as school size, grade configuration, and educational curriculum. It also adopts a Master Facilities Plan (MFP which includes recommendations for each campus and school service area based on modernization needs and enrollment projections. [END TEXT BOX] Many DCPS schools are in desperate need of modernization. As recently as 2002, 70 percent of its campuses were rated to be in poor physical condition by the Army Corps of Engineers. Over 80 percent of the school buildings are more than 55 years old, and many lack the necessary amenities and features for contemporary teaching. More than 65 schools are located on sites smaller than three acres, which is extremely confined by any standard. 1202.5 DCPS faces the challenge of declining enrollment. Between 1970 and 1990, as the city’s population fell by 20 percent and birth rates declined, enrollment plummeted from 147,000 students to 80,000 students. Forty-three schools closed. Enrollment continued to decline during the 1990s, though at a much slower rate. Between 1997 and 2005, enrollment dropped by another 11,000—this time the loss was largely driven by the growth of Public Charter schools. As Figure 12.1 shows, total enrollment in DCPS and the charter schools has been relatively stable since 1998, but the DCPS share has consistently declined. Enrollment in charter schools climbed to about 15,000 in 2005—more than 25 percent of the public school enrollment total. 1202.6 Like many urban school districts across the country, DCPS is struggling with large financial needs and increasing social needs. Poverty, disrupted families, and neighborhood violence challenge schools to do more—stay open longer, expand their services, and adopt a broader constituency. Many DCPS buildings, meanwhile, still look and operate much as they did generations ago. 1202.7 Through its Facilities Master Plan update, DCPS is evaluating all schools to “right-size” facilities to better meet the needs of existing and future students. Many schools are operating with enrollment that is far below recommended levels. Although smaller schools may sound attractive on the surface, they can lead to a more limited curriculum and reduced program offerings. The text box below includes the recommended enrollment levels for elementary, middle and high schools and describes the number of under-enrolled schools. 1202.8 [BEGIN TEXT BOX] Best Sizes for Schools 1202.9 Elementary Schools: DCPS indicates that an elementary school needs at least 318 students to offer quality, cost-effective programming. That assumes two classrooms per grade level; a full complement of art, music, physical education and library services; and a student: teacher ratio of 20:1 for grades pre-K- 301 2 and 25:1 for grades 3-6. The recommended elementary school size is between 300 and 500 students. In 2005, 40 DCPS elementary schools enrolled fewer than 300 students, 20 enrolled between 200 and 250 students, and 10 enrolled fewer than 200 students. One way schools have continued to operate with lower CITYWIDE ELEMENTS COMPREHENSIVE PLAN DISTRICT ELEMENTS ADOPTED 12/19/06 P. 1-298 enrollments has been to eliminate educational offerings; for example, elementary schools have cut staff for art, music, physical education and libraries. In all, DCPS is currently supporting 600 underutilized elementary-level classrooms and has about 14,000 available elementary school seats. Middle/Junior High Schools: The recommended middle/junior high school size is between 400 and 600 students. The larger middle schools would have the capacity to provide additional course variety beyond a high-quality core program. In 2005, DCPS had three middle or junior high schools with less than 350 students, one with less than 300 and two with fewer than 250. In all, DCPS is supporting 250 underutilized middle/junior high school classrooms and has more than 5,000 available seats. High Schools: The recommended comprehensive high school size is been 600 and 1,200 students. DCPS operates 20 senior high schools – 10 comprehensive high schools and 10 citywide magnet high schools. Four DCPS high schools enroll between 1,000 and 1,500 students, four enroll between 800 and 1,000, five enroll between 500 and 800, and five enroll less than 500. In all, there are more than 2,200 available high school seats in DCPS.

As of the 2005-06 school year, there were 52 charter schools in the city operating on 64 campuses. The location of Public Charter Schools in the city as of 2005 is shown in Map 12.2. The charter schools are funded by a per pupil allowance that helps them acquire and renovate space. They can be chartered through the District of Columbia Public Charter School Board or the District’s Board of Education. 1202.11 [INSERT Map 12.2: Location of Public Charter Schools 1203.3] Further growth in charter school enrollment is expected in the future, creating the need for additional space and financial resources. Like the modernized DC Public Schools, charter schools have helped catalyze the revitalization of several District neighborhoods. This is particularly true for schools that have occupied and restored DCPS facilities, such as Chamberlain, Woodridge, and Thurgood Marshall Academy. 1202.12 EDU-1.1 Improving DCPS Facility Condition 1203 For many years, DCPS maintained its buildings through an annual repair and replacement program. This approach only addressed short-term needs. Buildings became inefficient and obsolete due to the lack of a more comprehensive approach to modernization. 1203.1 302 Beginning in the late 1990s, DCPS initiated the practice of comprehensive facility master planning. In 2000, it adopted a Facilities Master Plan (FMP) that established 15-year goals and long-range planning policies for modernizing District schools. The FMP was updated in 2001, 2002, and 2003 and 2006. The new FMP supports the 2006 Master Education Plan (which addresses broader operational issues) through CITYWIDE ELEMENTS COMPREHENSIVE PLAN DISTRICT ELEMENTS ADOPTED 12/19/06 P. 1-299 related recommendations addressing the use of space and facilities. The District’s Comprehensive Plan seeks to capture the guiding policies provided by the FMP to ensure consistency with the District Government’s own land use policies and public facility plans. 1203.2 The National Clearinghouse for Educational Facilities reports that students attending school in new, modern facilities have been found to score five to seventeen points higher on standardized tests than students in older, substandard buildings. Recent DCPS experience at campuses such as Miner and McKinley mirrors this national experience and has shown that high-quality school facilities also strongly influence public perception, and increase the attractiveness of the modernized schools to parents and students. Modernized schools also can attract families to surrounding neighborhoods and increase private property values.1203.4 Significant progress toward the modernization of the building stock has been made in the last eight years. Five elementary schools (Oyster, Barnard, Miner, Key, and Randle Highlands) have been fully modernized. McKinley Technology High School is in its second year of operation, and Kelly Miller is now operating as a state-of-the-art middle school on the site of a formerly closed facility. The combined Bell and Lincoln Schools in Columbia Heights, and Thomson Elementary School in Shaw will soon join the inventory of modernized facilities. 1203.5 [PULLQUOTE: Significant progress toward the modernization of the building stock has been made in the last eight years.

CITYWIDE ELEMENTS COMPREHENSIVE PLAN DISTRICT ELEMENTS ADOPTED 12/19/06 P. 1-300 EDU-1.2 Public Charter Schools 1204 The public charter schools provide another choice for District families with school age children. Of the more than 50 charter schools within the District, several have waiting lists with hundreds of students. 1204.1 The appeal of these schools stems from several sources: they are free, their curriculum is set by an independent board of trustees, and they often specialize in particular subject areas such as math, science, or performing arts. The charter schools are funded by a per pupil allowance that helps them acquire and renovate space. They can be chartered through the District of Columbia Public Charter School Board or the District’s Board of Education. 1204.2 Although the Public Charter Schools operate in a wide range of facilities, their preference is usually to occupy former public schools due to the functionality of the space. This makes it essential to have clear policies on the use of surplus DCPS space. DCPS has expanded its traditional planning focus to include planning for those charter schools that indicate the need for additional space. 1204.3 Since 2002, the District of Columbia government has made several changes to the laws governing DCPS’ relationship with the public charter schools. The city has modified its Code on “Public School Facilities Governing the Reuse of Surplus School Space” by designating charter schools as having ‘right of first offer’ for the use of excess space. In 2004, the Board of Education adopted guidelines for identifying parts of DCPS school buildings that could be considered “excess to DCPS needs” and therefore suitable for use by Public Charter Schools. It also adopted guidelines for selecting public charter schools for colocation in DCPS facilities or on DCPS sites. 1204.4 The DCPS Board of Education has also adopted general principles acknowledging the role of charter schools in meeting the diverse needs of the city’s population and emphasizing the importance of safe and secure neighborhood public school facilities, regardless of who operates them. These principles laid the groundwork for co-location standards and detailed procedures for accommodating Public Charter schools within DCPS buildings. For instance, the standards allow charters to lease floors in underutilized school buildings where certain conditions are met (such as a separate entrance and adequate visitor parking While co-location may accommodate some of the demand for space, it is likely that space may be needed in non-school buildings as well. 1204.5 Policy EDU-1.2.1: Planning For Public Charter Schools Incorporate the needs of the Public Charter Schools in public school facility planning. 1204.6 Policy EDU-1.2.2: Co-Location of Charter and DCPS Schools Support DCPS and Board of Education efforts to co-locate Charter Schools within DCPS facilities. 304 Ensure that parking, traffic, noise, and other impacts associated with increased enrollment and space utilization are addressed when co-location occurs. 1204.7 Policy EDU-1.2.3: Locating Public Charter Schools Require that neighborhood impacts are addressed when a Public Charter or DCPS school locates in a nonschool facility, such as a vacant commercial or industrial building. 1204.8 EDU-1.3 Private Schools 1205 The National Center for Educational Statistics reports that there are 82 private schools in the District of Columbia. Twenty-six are affiliated with the Association of Independent Schools of Greater Washington (AISGW including facilities such as Georgetown Day School and Capitol Hill Day School. Enrollment CITYWIDE ELEMENTS COMPREHENSIVE PLAN DISTRICT ELEMENTS ADOPTED 12/19/06 P. 1-301 at the 26 AISGW schools has been stable over the past several years at about 11,000 students. These facilities are shown in Map 12.3. Most of the remaining schools are affiliated with churches, including 18 represented by the National Catholic Educational Association and several affiliated with other religious organizations. 1205.1 [INSERT Map 12.3: Locations of Private Schools 1205.2] Policy EDU-1.3.1: Private Schools Recognize private schools as an important part of Washington’s educational infrastructure. Private school representatives should be encouraged to participate in citywide educational facility planning initiatives. 1205.3 EDU-1.4 School Building Design and Site Planning 1206 Attractive, well-designed, and well-sited schools communicate respect for the people that use them and contribute to a positive school climate, good discipline, and productive learning. By strategically locating windows, access points, and gathering places, for example, school designers can foster student safety and security. High-quality site planning and architecture also provide an opportunity to enhance the learning experience. 1206.1 It is also important that school modernization projects are sensitive to issues that extend beyond school boundaries. Issues like the safety of children traveling to and from school, public transit accessibility, and parking and traffic must be considered. 1206.2 [Photo Caption: Attractive, well-designed, and well-sited schools communicate respect for the people that use them and contribute to a positive school climate, good discipline, and productive learning.] Policy EDU-1.4.1: Site Planning Encourage DCPS to plan for the modernization of entire school campuses rather than just the school buildings themselves. Where school facilities are adjoined by athletic fields, playgrounds, and open space, the improvement of these areas should be included in renovation plans wherever feasible. In addition, school employee parking should not be provided at the expense of recreational space. 1206.3 Policy EDU-1.4.2: Promoting High-Quality Design Require that the renovation or reconstruction of school facilities use high architectural and landscape design standards that are sensitive to community context as well as academic and student safety needs. 1206.4 Policy EDU-1.4.3: Safety First: Designing For Multiple Uses 305 Encourage school design to include appropriate measures to keep students safe, especially where multiple activities are accommodated in a single structure. 1206.5 Policy EDU-1.4.4: Eco-Friendly Design Strongly support the use of green building, energy efficiency, and low-impact development methods in school construction and rehabilitation. 1206.6 Policy EDU-1.4.5: Pedestrian and Transit Access to Schools Increase coordination between DDOT and DCPS to improve the safety of students walking to and from school through design and transportation improvements. In addition, new school buildings should be designed to foster safe and attractive pedestrian access. At the high school level, encourage the routing of CITYWIDE ELEMENTS COMPREHENSIVE PLAN DISTRICT ELEMENTS ADOPTED 12/19/06 P. 1-302 bus lines to provide easy access to campuses, thereby minimizing the need for students to drive to school. 1206.7 Policy EDU-1.4.6: Neighborhood Schools Strongly support the goal of making one’s neighborhood school the “school of choice” so that children do not have to travel long distances to schools across town. 1206.8 EDU-1.5 Planning For the Long-Term Future 1207 An important long-range planning objective is to align DCPS enrollment projections with the Comprehensive Plan demographic forecasts. The Comprehensive Plan can aid DCPS by identifying the specific schools that may be most impacted by new development, and therefore most in need of future expansion. 1207.1 In the District of Columbia, the relationship between new housing construction and school planning is complex. The city’s policies allow students to travel to schools in other parts of the city, leading to significant out-of-boundary enrollment at many facilities. Figure 12.2 shows the daily migration of students from their homes to out–of-boundary schools often located many miles away. Another complicating factor in projecting enrollment is the large percentage of students attending charters and private schools, rather than the neighborhood DCPS school. 1207.2 [INSERT Figure 12.2: Daily migration of students from home to out-of-boundary schools.1207.5] [Caption: The width of the arrows indicates the relative number of students who travel from one DCPS Planning Area to another to attend school. The letters indicate the eight DCPS Planning Areas.] Moreover, the Comprehensive Plan cannot predict who will actually occupy new housing units and whether they will be singles or families with children. In addition, increases in enrollment may take place in stable neighborhoods as the existing housing stock changes hands—even though very little new construction is occurring. 1207.3 At this point in time, DCPS official projections indicate declining enrollment over the next seven years. Their forecasts assume continued out-migration of families with school age children, and continued low birth rates. Total public school enrollment (including the charter schools) is expected to drop by 2,000 students between 2006 and 2013. When the charter schools are subtracted out, the decline is even steeper. As Figure 12.3 indicates, attendance at DCPS facilities is expected to drop from 58,000 in 2006 to 50,000 in 2012. Public Charter schools are projected to pick up about two-thirds of this reduction. 1207.4 [INSERT Figure 12.3: DCPS Enrollment Projections, 2006-2013 (excluding charters) 1207.6] DCPS is in the process of updating these forecasts, in part to reflect new assumptions about growth 306 and demographics. The reality is that even if only 10 percent of the new homes projected for the District between now and 2025 included one school-aged child, there could be 5,000 new students. If the District can successfully rebuild its educational infrastructure and begin attracting families back to the city, the decline in enrollment could be reversed. Such uncertainty about the future suggests that the District approach the disposition of surplus public school facilities with great caution. Once a facility is gone, it is gone. Given the high cost and limited supply of land, the District should retain as many of its assets as possible, even if they are used for other uses in the short or mid-term. 1207.7 The reality is that some schools will continue to see declining enrollment, while others will see increases. For schools facing decline, it will be an ongoing struggle to provide diverse programs and attract quality teachers. For schools facing growth, measures will be needed to expand facilities and avoid CITYWIDE ELEMENTS COMPREHENSIVE PLAN DISTRICT ELEMENTS ADOPTED 12/19/06 P. 1-303 overcrowding. As spatial mismatches between growth and capacity occur, boundary adjustments and grade realignments will be needed to distribute students more evenly. 1207.8 [PULLQUOTE: The reality is that some schools will continue to see declining enrollment, while others will see increases. For schools facing decline, it will be an ongoing struggle to provide diverse programs and attract quality teachers. For schools facing growth, measures will be needed to expand facilities and avoid overcrowding.] In the short-term, DCPS is already planning to consolidate school facilities and will be eliminating one million square feet of space by July 2007 and an additional two million square feet by July 2008. Recent modifications to District regulations make it clear that DCPS will retain surplus buildings to provide opportunities for Public Charter schools. The updated Facilities Master Plan provides additional direction on the use of excess space, responding to the priorities set by the 2006 Master Education Plan. One factor to be considered in the disposition of school land is that some of the school grounds were formally owned and maintained by the federal government. When their jurisdiction was transferred to District in 1973, the transfers were typically made for “recreational” purposes. Such use constraints must be considered as school properties are re-purposed 1207.9 Policy EDU-1.5.1: Retention of Public Schools Retain public school buildings in public ownership to the maximum extent feasible. This will put the District in a better position to respond to future demographic shifts, address long-term needs for public education and special education, and maintain the need for “swing space” which temporarily accommodates students during construction or renovation projects. 1207.10 Policy EDU-1.5.2: Reuse of School Surplus Space Consistent with the DC Municipal Regulations, use the following priorities to determine the future use of schools that are deemed surplus and turned over to the DC Office of Property Management a) First priority should be re-use for direct educational purposes, including Public Charter schools (b) Second priority should be for other District agency facilities that strengthen families, such as day care and early childhood development centers, job training libraries, recreation centers, or health care 307 (c) Third priority should be for other uses that provide a public benefit (such as District government administrative offices or affordable housing) 1207.11 Policy EDU-1.5.3: Long-Term Leases Strongly encourage long-term leases instead of sales so that underutilized school sites and buildings can be retained in public ownership. This approach is necessary due the limited availability of District- owned land for public facility uses, and the need to retain such land to deliver quality public services and anticipate long-term changes in enrollment. 1207.12 Policy EDU-1.5.4: Preserving Sites Near Transit Preserve school sites located near Metrorail and other locations well served by transit for educational use. 1207.13 Policy EDU-1.5.5: Adaptive Re-Use In the event that surplus DCPS facilities are converted to non-school uses, require the new uses to be sensitive to neighborhood context and to mitigate impacts on parking, traffic, noise, and other quality of life factors. Provide for public review of potential new uses, and ensure that any issues related to prior jurisdiction over the site by the federal government are addressed. 1207.14 See also the Land Use Element for additional policies on the reuse of public school land. CITYWIDE ELEMENTS COMPREHENSIVE PLAN DISTRICT ELEMENTS ADOPTED 12/19/06 P. 1-304 EDU-2.0 Schools as Community Anchors 1208 Schools are powerful indicators of community values and aspirations. In addition to supporting the academic needs of local students, they can reflect the social, educational, recreational, and personal needs of the broader community. Historically, the District’s schools have been anchors for the community at large, serving as neighborhood gathering places. 1208.1 [PULLQUOTE: In addition to supporting the academic needs of local students, schools can reflect the social, educational, recreational, and personal needs of the broader community. Historically, the District’s schools have been anchors for the community at large, serving as neighborhood gathering places.] The District has a history of collaborative arrangements with its school facilities. For years, our schools have hosted recreational programs, public services, and even family services such as health care. DCPS foresees many opportunities to establish mutually beneficial partnerships with District agencies and the non-profit sector in the future to help sustain schools as community anchors. This principle is strongly supported by the DCPS Facilities Master Plan and is regarded as key to improving the emotional and physical health of our neighborhoods. 1208.2 EDU-2.1 Neighborhood-Centered Schools 1209 In 2001, DCPS launched the Transformation Schools Initiative to effectively transform 14 DC Public Schools into high-performing, child-centered, family- and community-focused learning centers.

The inclusion of schools in these plans can help promote parental involvement, improve school safety, and create connections between the school and the larger community around it. Coordinated planning also provides a means for residents to address land use, design, transportation, and physical planning issues associated with schools, and to voice opinions on the types of non-educational services that might be provided on school campuses. 1210.1 Policy EDU-2.2.1: Intergovernmental Coordination Coordinate DCPS facility planning efforts with District agencies to ensure that school modernization produces better education facilities for District children while also improving the neighborhood. 1210.2 Policy EDU-2.2.2: Educational Facilities in Local Plans 309 Involve the District of Columbia Public Schools in District government land use and transportation planning activities.

These institutions enroll more than 75,000 students. Map 12.4 shows their locations. 1211.2 [INSERT Map 12.4: Locations of Colleges and Universities 1212.2] In addition to the schools listed above, many non-local universities maintain Washington, DC campuses. Thousands of students from across the country attend “Washington semester” programs at these institutions, learning about the mechanics of the federal government. Other institutions of higher learning, such as the Corcoran College of Art and Johns Hopkins University, enroll hundreds of students at campuses across Downtown. 1211.3 The University of the District of Columbia is the District’s only post-secondary public educational institution. The historically Black university is also the only urban land-grant institution in the nation. It offers certificate, associate, baccalaureate, and graduate level degrees that are tailored to meet the unique needs of the District. Available programs range from associate degrees in Nursing and Mortuary Science to masters degrees in Cancer Biology Prevention and Clinical Psychology. Over 50 different programs of study are offered. 1211.4 UDC serves a very diverse population that includes students from over 25 different nations. The school has an open admissions policy that is particularly beneficial for non-traditional students. It provides an important opportunity for young adults and adult learners to gain a quality education at an affordable price. 1211.5 EDU-3.1 University of the District of Columbia 1212 Continued political and financial support for UDC is essential if it is to fulfill its mission as a viable educational option and path to career advancement for District residents. Establishment of a UDC satellite campus to better serve residents’ educational and training needs is an idea that has much support throughout the community. Neighborhoods east of the Anacostia River are particularly well situated for such a campus—there are no institutions of higher learning there and there are several large sites where they might be accommodated. This element recommends that an educational satellite campus be established. 1212.1 310 Policy EDU-3.1.1: Sustaining and Advancing UDC Sustain, promote, and advance the University of the District of Columbia as the city’s only public institution of higher learning and continuing education for District residents. 1212.3 Policy EDU-3.1.2: Strengthen Training and Career Programs Strengthen the community college function of UDC to continue training students for the baccalaureate program, and to build practical career skills that prepare students for current and future employment in the District. 1212.4 CITYWIDE ELEMENTS COMPREHENSIVE PLAN DISTRICT ELEMENTS ADOPTED 12/19/06 P. 1-307 Action EDU-3.1-A: Develop a Satellite UDC Campus East of the Anacostia River Pursue the development of a satellite campus of the University of the District of Columbia east of the Anacostia River. 1212.5 EDU-3.2 Educational Partnerships 1213 The array of learning institutions within the District is vitally important to the city and its residents, particularly its youth. Institutions of higher learning are involved in a myriad of community and educational partnerships to improve access to education, economic opportunities for District residents, and investment in the community at-large. Partnerships between institutions of higher learning and DCPS and its students have and should continue to provide educational opportunities and advantages for our children (see example in text box at left 1213.1 [BEGIN SIDEBAR] Successful Partnerships for Education: One Example 1212.4 The DC School Without Walls was established in 1971 through a cooperative effort between DCPS and the George Washington University. As the name implies, this public school uses the city as a classroom and offers an alternative to conventional instructional programs. The School Without Walls has been a great success. One recent indicator is that all 340 students who graduated from School Without Walls High School in June 2005 went on to college. [END SIDEBAR] Policy EDU-3.2.1: University Partnerships Encourage partnerships between the city’s universities, anchor institutions, and K-12 schools to create additional pathways to learning for District students and young adults. 1213.2 Policy EDU-3.2.2: Corporate Citizenship Support continued “corporate citizenship” among the city’s large institutions, including its colleges, universities, hospitals, private schools, and non-profits. This should include a continued commitment to high quality architecture and design on local campuses, expanded use of “green building” methods and low impact development, and the adaptive reuse and preservation of historic buildings. 1213.3 EDU-3.3 Colleges, Universities, and Neighborhoods 1214 The growth of colleges and universities, while supported by the city, has generated concerns in some Washington neighborhoods. Most of the universities have limited land area for expansion, and are located immediately adjacent to residential neighborhoods. Neighborhood concerns relate to impacts such as traffic and parking, and to broader issues about the changing character of communities where universities are located or expanding. 1214.1 The Zoning Regulations require the preparation of campus plans showing the location, height, and bulk of present and future improvements for all colleges located in residential zone districts. In addition to serving as physical site plans, the campus plans set Floor Area Ratio (FAR) limits for the campus as a 311 whole, and in some cases establish enrollment and employment caps. Campus plans are subject to approval by the Zoning Commission. 1214.2 The campus plan requirement provides a formalized process for community input on a range of growthrelated issues. They are an important tool to proactively address issues that may be of concern to the CITYWIDE ELEMENTS COMPREHENSIVE PLAN DISTRICT ELEMENTS ADOPTED 12/19/06 P. 1-308 neighborhood and limit campus expansion into residential areas. However, most of the city’s colleges and universities are engaged in ongoing discussions with the communities around them. Frequently raised issues include the need for student housing, the loss of historic buildings, the compatibility of proposed campus structures with nearby residential areas, and the loss of taxable land associated with university growth. Campus plans have responded to these concerns in a number of ways, such as increasing building intensity on-site to avoid the need for land acquisition, development of new dormitories, and implementation of numerous programs to manage parking, traffic, noise, and other environmental impacts. 1214.3 Looking forward, the development of satellite campuses is strongly encouraged to relieve growth pressure around existing campuses. In addition to accommodating university growth, satellite campuses can provide new job and educational opportunities for District residents and help revitalize local shopping districts. Neighborhoods east of the Anacostia River are particularly well situated for such campuses— there are no institutions of higher learning there at present and there are several large sites where they might be accommodated. Continued efforts to improve the campus planning process and promote an open dialogue between the colleges and the neighborhoods around should be strongly supported. 1214.4 [PULLQUOTE: The development of satellite campuses is strongly encouraged to relieve growth pressure around existing campuses. In addition to accommodating university growth, satellite campuses can provide new job and educational opportunities for District residents and help revitalize local shopping districts.] Policy EDU-3.3.1: Satellite Campuses Promote the development of satellite campuses to accommodate university growth, relieve growth pressure on neighborhoods adjacent to existing campuses, spur economic development and revitalization in neighborhoods lagging in market activity, and create additional lifelong learning opportunities for DC residents. 1214.5 Policy EDU-3.3.2: Balancing University Growth and Neighborhood Needs Encourage the growth and development of local colleges and universities in a manner that recognizes the role these institutions play in contributing to the District’s character, culture, economy, and is also consistent with and supports community improvement and neighborhood conservation objectives. Discourage university actions that would adversely affect the character or quality of life in surrounding residential areas. 1214.6 Policy EDU-3.3.3: Campus Plan Requirements Continue to require campus plans for colleges and universities located in residential and mixed use zone districts. These plans should be prepared by the institutions themselves, subject to District review and approval, and should address issues raised by the surrounding communities. Each campus plan should include provisions that ensure that the institution is not likely to become objectionable to neighboring property because of noise, traffic, number of students, or other similar conditions. 1214.7 Policy EDU-3.3.4: Student Housing Encourage the provision of on-campus student housing in order to reduce college and university 312 impacts on the housing stock in adjacent neighborhoods. Consider measures to address the demand for student housing generated by non-District institutions with local branches. 1214.8 Policy EDU-3.3.5: Transportation Impacts of Colleges and Universities Support ongoing efforts by colleges and universities to mitigate their traffic and parking impacts by promoting ridesharing, carpooling, shuttle service, bicycling, and other transportation demand CITYWIDE ELEMENTS COMPREHENSIVE PLAN DISTRICT ELEMENTS ADOPTED 12/19/06 P. 1-309 management measures. The provision of adequate on-site parking for institutional uses also should be encouraged. 1214.9 Action EDU-3.3.A: University-Community Task Force Establish a Task Force comprised of college and university representatives, neighborhood representatives, local businesses, and other non-university community stakeholders to address a range of physical planning issues relating to college and university growth and operation. Among other topics, the Task Force should address community concerns regarding the enforcement of campus plans and monitoring procedures, university concerns regarding enrollment and employment caps, the regulation of non- District based colleges with expanding local facilities, and possible amendments to the zoning regulations as they relate to campus plans and higher education facilities. 1214.10 CITYWIDE ELEMENTS COMPREHENSIVE PLAN DISTRICT ELEMENTS ADOPTED 12/19/06 P. 1-310 CHAPTER 13 INFRASTRUCTURE ELEMENT Overview 1300 The Infrastructure Element provides policies and actions on the District’s water, sanitary sewer, stormwater, solid waste management, energy, and telecommunication systems. Investments in these systems are essential to our city’s future, both to meet the demands of existing users and to accommodate future change and development. 1300.1 Like many older historic cities, the District suffers from aging infrastructure. Some portions of the water and sewer systems were built more than a century ago. The central challenge faced by the District is not one of capacity but one of meeting maintenance and replacement needs. In fact, the number of households in the city today is not substantially different than it was in 1950, though there are 230,000 fewer residents. Consequently, infrastructure is generally in place to support additional development, with some exceptions at specific locations where development did not previously exist. The conveyance systems and facilities, however, are suffering from structural deterioration and are in need of significant rehabilitation, modernization, and expansion as aging components approach the end of their useful lives. 1300.2 The planning, management, and oversight of the District’s utilities is shared by several agencies, including the District of Columbia Water and Sewer Authority (WASA the US Army Corps of Engineers, PEPCO, Washington Gas, and the District’s Department of Public Works. In addition, the General Services Administration (GSA) contracts with Washington Gas and PEPCO to supply federal agencies with electricity and natural gas. This Element incorporates planning and policy guidance from the short-term and long-term plans of these service providers. 1300.3 The critical infrastructure issues facing the District of Columbia are addressed in this Element. These issues include: Improving water quality and public health by addressing the city’s combined sewer and wastewater 313 system Modernizing the aging water distribution system Ensuring the District has a world class telecommunications system with access for residents and businesses across the city. 1300.4 Infrastructure Goal 1301 The overarching goal for infrastructure is as follows: Provide high-quality, efficiently managed and maintained, and properly funded infrastructure to serve existing development, as well as future change and growth. 1301.1 [PULLQUOTE: Infrastructure Goal: The overarching goal for infrastructure is as follows: Provide highquality, efficiently managed and maintained, and properly funded infrastructure to serve existing development, as well as future change and growth.] CITYWIDE ELEMENTS COMPREHENSIVE PLAN DISTRICT ELEMENTS ADOPTED 12/19/06 P. 1-311 Policies and Actions IN-1.0 Drinking Water 1302 The water system serving the District of Columbia consists of two primary components: the water supply and treatment system, and the water distribution system. 1302.1 Water Supply and Treatment The supply and treatment system includes raw water sources, pipelines carrying this water to treatment plants, and the water treatment plants themselves. The Washington Aqueduct Division of the US Army Corps of Engineers (USACE) operates and maintains these facilities and supplies treated water to several distributors. These distributors (which include WASA) deliver water to over one million users in the District and Northern Virginia. 1302.2 The Washington Aqueduct was commissioned by Congress and built by the USACE in the 1850s to provide the nation's capital with a plentiful water source. It has been in continuous operation ever since. 1302.3 The Aqueduct System is composed of the Great Falls and Little Falls intakes on the Potomac River, the Dalecarlia and McMillan Reservoirs, the Georgetown Conduit and Reservoir, the Washington City Tunnel, and the East Shaft Pump Station. Figure 13.1 shows the Washington Aqueduct System. 1302.4 Water from the Aqueduct is currently allocated based on a Low Flow Allocation Agreement (LFAA) that was signed by the United States, Maryland, Virginia, the District of Columbia, the Washington Suburban Sanitary Commission, and the Fairfax County Water Authority in 1978. The Agreement recognized the need to maintain a minimum flow in the Potomac River in order to sustain aquatic resources. It established a set of stages for river flow that would prompt action by the signatories to monitor and eventually restrict water withdrawal. It also established a formula for allocating Potomac River water during times of shortage. To date, the LFAA’s low-flow stages have never been triggered. 1302.5 In 1982, the major water utilities and the Interstate Commission on the Potomac River Basin (ICPRB) signed the Water Supply Coordination Agreement (WSCA It required the major water suppliers to coordinate their operations during drought emergencies. The Agreement also required that a 20-year study of supply and demand be prepared and updated every five years. It also included cost-sharing agreements for new facilities and subsequently included the Jennings Randolph and Little Seneca Reservoirs that serve as back-up water supply during droughts. 1302.6 [INSERT Figure 13.1: Washington Aqueduct System 1302.7] The ICPRB Year 2005 assessment concluded that even under a high regional growth scenario, the 314 water supply system developed 25 years ago is adequate to meet 2025 demand under a repeat of the worst meteorological and stream flow conditions in the historical record. The Assessment found that the system would also be able to meet estimated future water supply demand in 2045 given a repeat of the same drought conditions. 1302.8 The historic maximum production from the Washington Aqueduct was 284 million gallons per day (mgd which occurred in 1974. Since 1974, water demand has decreased due to declining population and water conservation measures. Water demand is now relatively stable. In 2005, the average daily CITYWIDE ELEMENTS COMPREHENSIVE PLAN DISTRICT ELEMENTS ADOPTED 12/19/06 P. 1-312 production from the Washington Aqueduct Division was approximately 185 mgd with a maximum day use of approximately 245 mgd. 1302.9 [PULLQUOTE: The historic maximum production from the Washington Aqueduct was 284 million gallons per day (mgd which occurred in 1974. Since 1974, water demand has decreased due to declining population and water conservation measures. Water demand is now relatively stable.] The Corps of Engineers treats water from the Aqueduct at the Dalecarlia and McMillan water treatment plants (WTPs Both of these plants were designed for much larger populations and higher water use projections than have been realized. As a result, their treatment capacity exceeds present-day demands and peak requirements of the customers. The Dalecarlia facility has a design capacity of 164 million gallons per day (mgd) and maximum capacity of 264 mgd. The McMillan facility has a design capacity of 120 mgd and a maximum capacity of 180 mgd. WASA’s projected average water demand based on population in 2020 is 156.5 mgd. Both Dalecarlia and McMillan serve the needs of the District (Dalecarlia also serves Arlington and Falls Church so projected demand is well within the respective design capacities. 1302.10 Projections for future water demand for the regional WASA Service Area are shown in Table 13.1. These projections are maintained by WASA and assume levels of growth consistent with this Comprehensive Plan and the plans of adjacent cities and counties in the service area. 1302.11 Table 13.1: Current and Projected Water Demands (mgd WASA Service Area 1302.12 Year 2000 Year 2020 Increase from 2000 to 2020 Annual Average Day Maximum Day Peak Hour Annual Average Day Maximum Day Peak Hour Annual Average Day Maximum Day Peak Hour 136 .8 189.6 345.7 156 .5 217.8 396.3 19.7 28.2 50.6 Source: DC Water and Sewer Authority, 2005 The WASA planning period is 2000-2020 rather than the Comp Plan period of 2005-2025. WASA projections are currently being updated. Water Storage, Pumping, and Distribution Water storage and pumping responsibilities are shared by WASA and the Washington Aqueduct. WASA 315 operates four treated water pumping stations (Anacostia; Bryant Street; Fort Reno; and 16th and Alaska and eight reservoirs and elevated tanks. The Washington Aqueduct operates the Dalecarlia Pump Station and three reservoirs: Foxhall, Van Ness, and Fort Reno. 1302.13 The DC Water and Sewer Authority is the primary agency responsible for the District’s treated water distribution system. This system consists of pipelines and hydrants that deliver water to customers and meet other municipal needs such as fire fighting. The system is divided into seven water distribution zones (also known as service areas) based on differences in ground elevation. These areas are shown on Figure 13.2. 1302.14 The distribution system includes almost 1,300 miles of pipes ranging in size from four to 78 inches in diameter. It also includes over 36,000 valves and approximately 9,000 hydrants. More than 50 percent of the water mains in the system are over 100 years old. These older cast iron water mains are vulnerable to breaks and also are subject to a problem called tuberculation, in which small mounds of corroded materials accumulate in the pipes. WASA continually assesses the reliability and integrity of the water CITYWIDE ELEMENTS COMPREHENSIVE PLAN DISTRICT ELEMENTS ADOPTED 12/19/06 P. 1-313 and sewer system pipes. To the extent that maintenance, corrosion, and break reports reveal problems, specific upgrades are factored into the Capital Improvement Program 1302.15 [Insert Figure 13.2: WASA Water Service Distribution Zones] IN-1.1 Ensuring an Adequate Future Water Supply 1303 As noted above, the Interstate Commission on the Potomac River has concluded that water flow in the River and impoundments at upstream reservoirs will to be more than adequate to meet water needs through at least 2045. Due to conservation efforts and other measures, 20 year forecasts are lower today than they were in 1990, 1995, or 2000. 1303.1 [PULLQUOTE: The Interstate Commission on the Potomac River has concluded that water flow in the River and impoundments at upstream reservoirs will to be more than adequate to meet water needs through at least 2045.] Despite the projections, there are always uncertainties associated with the future. For example, climate change may have an impact on resources that would change the study results, especially given the sensitivity of Potomac reservoirs to changes in historical streamflow. One positive trend is the water conservation efforts of recent years. The ICPRB 2005 study noted that single-family household water use rates declined approximately 18 percent between 1990 and 2000 in the Washington area. The study also noted that supplier programs encouraging conservation were an important factor behind this trend. 1303.2 [PULLQUOTE: A positive trend is the water conservation of recent years. The ICPRB 2005 study noted that single-family household water use rates declined approximately 18 percent between 1990 and 2000 in the Washington area.The study also noted that supplier programs encouraging conservation were an important factor behind this trend.] The following policy states the District’s commitment to plan for the long-term adequacy of water supply. It is supplemented by policies in the Environmental Protection Element on water conservation. 1303.3 316 Policy IN-1.1.1: Adequate Water Supply Ensure a safe, adequate water supply to serve current and future District of Columbia needs by working with other regional jurisdictions, the Army Corps of Engineers and WASA. 1303.4 IN-1.2 Modernizing Water Infrastructure 1304 In conjunction with WASA, the District must consider the impacts of new development and ensure that water infrastructure will be able to meet future demand. Planned improvements to the water system involve normal maintenance to replace aging water distribution mains and small diameter pipes, and upgrades to keep pace with population growth and new development. This may also include the addition of new water storage facilities, increasing the capacity of certain water mains, and upgrading pump stations. 1304.1 WASA’s Capital Improvement Program has identified the need for several new storage facilities to support growth projections. These facilities will provide additional water pressure to certain areas of the District as well as emergency backup service. Two million gallons of elevated storage is needed in the southern half of the Anacostia First High service area. WASA has worked with the District and reached an agreement to site this water storage tank on the East Campus of St. Elizabeth’s Hospital. Currently, CITYWIDE ELEMENTS COMPREHENSIVE PLAN DISTRICT ELEMENTS ADOPTED 12/19/06 P. 1-314 necessary approvals and permits are being pursued, including historic preservation approvals that will ensure no historic structures on the campus are negatively impacted. Another two million gallon elevated storage tank will be needed in the fourth high service area in the Upper Northwest. The Washington Aqueduct CIP also calls for storage improvements at the Georgetown Reservoir and for additional dewatering facilities at the Dalecarlia water treatment/reservoir site. 1304.2 Policy IN-1.2.1: Modernizing and Rehabilitating Water Infrastructure Work proactively with WASA to repair and replace aging infrastructure, and to upgrade the water distribution system to meet current and future demand. The District will support water system improvement programs that rehabilitate or replace undersized, defective, or deteriorating mains. The District will also support concurrent programs that ensure that lines are flushed in order to eliminate the potential for stagnant water to accumulate at the ends of water mains. ANCs and community organizations should be consulted in the siting of any new facilities to ensure that the potential for adverse impacts are appropriately addressed. 1304.3 Policy IN-1.2.2: Ensuring Adequate Water Pressure Work proactively with WASA to provide land for new storage tanks and other necessary operations so that adequate water supply and pressure can be provided to all areas of the District. The siting and design of water storage tanks and similar facilities should be consistent with the policies of the Urban Design and Environmental Protection Elements, and should minimize visual impacts and “skylining” effects on ridges or hills. 1304.4 Action IN-1.2-A: Water System Maps Support WASA efforts to update water system maps to accurately show pipelines, valves, and hydrants, as well as the age, material, size, and lining of pipelines. 1304.5 Action IN-1.2-B: Small Diameter Water Main Rehabilitation Program Continue the implementation of the Small Diameter Water Main Rehabilitation Program as identified in the WASA CIP. Work includes rehabilitating small diameter (12-inch diameter and smaller) water 317 mains to improve water pressure, system reliability, and flows in the system, as well as to maintain water quality. 1304.6 Action IN-1.2-C: Water Treatment Plant (WTP) Improvements Implement the planned improvements for the McMillan and Dalecarlia WTPs as identified in the Washington Aqueduct CIP. Planned improvements at McMillan include elevator and crane replacements and building renovations. Planned improvements at Dalecarlia include building, roadway and security improvements and clearwell cleaning and disinfection. 1304.7 Please consult the Environmental Protection Element for policies on drinking water quality and water conservation. IN-2.0 Wastewater and Stormwater Systems 1305 This section of the Element addresses wastewater and stormwater needs as well as WASA’s efforts to improve its system to meet current and future needs. Although wastewater and stormwater disposal needs are very different, they are addressed together in this section because of the physical links that currently exist between the two systems. 1305.1 CITYWIDE ELEMENTS COMPREHENSIVE PLAN DISTRICT ELEMENTS ADOPTED 12/19/06 P. 1-315 Like many older American cities, a significant portion of the District of Columbia is served by a combined sewer system. Such systems, which use the same pipes to convey stormwater and wastewater, were common in the 19th Century and are considered a relic of the past due to their damaging environmental effects. In wet weather, or about once every 10 days on average, the capacity of the District’s conveyance system is exceeded. Excess raw sewage and rain water flows into the District’s waterways via more than 60 permitted outfalls along rivers and streams. This discharge is called Combined Sewer Overflow (CSO Plans to reduce CSO while meeting the city’s future drainage and wastewater needs are discussed below. 1305.2 [PULLQUOTE: Like many older American cities, a significant portion of the District of Columbia is served by a combined sewer system. Such systems, which use the same pipes to convey stormwater and wastewater, were common in the 19th Century and are considered a relic of the past due to their damaging environmental effects.] IN-2.1 Wastewater System 1306 The District of Columbia Water and Sewer Authority is responsible for wastewater collection and transmission in the District, including operation and maintenance of the sanitary sewer system. The conveyance infrastructure consists of 1,800 miles of sanitary sewers and combined sanitary and stormwater sewers, 22 flow metering stations, and nine wastewater pumping stations. WASA is also responsible for 125,000 sewer laterals from its mains to the property boundaries of residential, government, and commercial properties. In addition, WASA is responsible for the 50-mile-long Potomac Interceptor System, which provides conveyance of wastewater from areas in Virginia and Maryland to the Blue Plains Treatment Plant. 1306.1 The existing sanitary sewer system dates back to 1810, and includes a variety of materials such as brick and concrete, vitrified clay and concrete, reinforced concrete, ductile iron, plastic, steel, brick, cast iron, cast in place concrete, and even fiberglass. Current sewer construction materials typically consist of PVC, ductile iron, and concrete. Force mains are generally constructed of iron, steel, or concrete. 1306.2 WASA operates the Blue Plains Advanced Wastewater Treatment Plant, located on the Potomac River in Far Southwest. The Plant provides wastewater treatment services to over two million customers, including residents of the District of Columbia and over 1.6 million residents in portions of 318 Montgomery and Prince George’s Counties in Maryland and Fairfax and Loudoun Counties in Virginia. Treatment includes liquid process facilities for both sanitary sewer and peak storm flows, along with solids processing facilities. 1306.3 Blue Plains is rated for an average flow of 370 million gallons per day (MGD It is required by its National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System (NPDES) permit to completely treat a peak flow rate of 740 MGD for up to four hours, and provide continuous treatment flows of up to 511 MGD thereafter. Additionally, up to 336 MGD storm water flow must receive partial treatment, resulting in a total plant capacity of 1,076 MGD. 1306.4 The 10-year WASA Capital Improvement Program (CIP) budget (FY 2004 – 2013) totals $2.1 billion and is funded by user fees and outside sources such as the USEPA and WASA’s regional partners in Maryland and Virginia. Their CIP identifies a range of sewer replacement projects and system upgrades. WASA’s CIP program also includes several steps to mitigate odors at the Blue Plains Water Treatment Facility. The $257 million Egg-Shaped, Anaerobic Digestion Facilities will replace the existing digesters, resulting in a less odorous, more consistent end product. The $79.4 million Dewatering Facilities Plan is designed to minimize odors that occur from biosolids being stored for extended periods. The $19.8 CITYWIDE ELEMENTS COMPREHENSIVE PLAN DISTRICT ELEMENTS ADOPTED 12/19/06 P. 1-316 million Gravity Thickening Facility Upgrade includes funds for the addition of chemicals to the influent flow for odor control. 1306.5 The projected growth in population and jobs in the District of Columbia could add an estimated 20 MGD of total water demand, which would result in a commensurate increase in wastewater of 17 to 20 MGD. Approximately two-thirds of this growth is expected to occur within the combined sewer area. While the wastewater transmission system has adequate capacity for this volume, land use changes will require localized additions and pipeline increases. In the combined sewer area, increases should be factored into the planned upgrades under the Combined Sewer System Long Term Control Plan. 1306.6 Policy IN-2.1.1: Improving Wastewater Collection Provide for the safe and efficient collection of wastewater generated by the households and businesses of the District. Ensure that new development does not exacerbate wastewater system deficiencies, and instead supports improved system efficiency and reliability. 1306.7 Policy IN-2.1.2: Investing In Our Wastewater Treatment Facilities Provide sustained capital investment in the District’s wastewater treatment system to reduce overflows of untreated sewage and improve the quality of effluent discharged to surface waters. Ensure that the Blue Plains treatment plant is maintained and upgraded as needed to meet capacity needs and to incorporate technological advances in wastewater treatment. 1306.8 Policy IN-2.1.3: Sludge Disposal Promote the development of cost-effective and environmentally sound techniques to dispose of sewage sludge, including measures to extract energy from sludge where feasible. 1306.9 Action IN-2.1-A: Wastewater Treatment Capital Improvements Continue to implement wastewater treatment improvements as identified in the WASA CIP. These projects include the replacement of undersized, aging, or deteriorated sewers; the installation of 319 sewers to serve areas of new development or changed development patterns; and pumping station force main replacement and rehabilitation. Capital projects are required to rehabilitate, upgrade or provide new facilities at Blue Plains to ensure that it can reliably meet its NPDES permit requirements and produce a consistent, high- quality dewatered solids product for land application. 1306.10 Action IN-2.1-B: Unauthorized Storm Sewer Connections Locate and map all stormwater and sanitary sewer lines outside of the combined sanitary and stormwater system area in order to identify sanitary lines that may be illegally discharging into the stormwater system. Take appropriate corrective measures, including penalties and termination of service, to abate such unauthorized connections. 1306.11 IN-2.2 Stormwater Management 1307 The District’s storm drainage system consists of approximately 8,200 catch basins, 600 miles of storm sewers, and 15 stormwater pumping stations. WASA also maintains over 400 separate storm sewer discharges into local rivers and creeks. Since the early 1900s, separate stormwater and sanitary sewers have been constructed within the District and no new combined sewers have been built. 1307.1 Planned and programmed stormwater improvements include the replacement of undersized or deteriorated storm sewers with new and larger diameter pipes, and the installation of storm sewers to serve areas of new development or changed development patterns. Rehabilitation and replacement of pumping station force mains also is planned. Regional and inter-governmental cooperation will be CITYWIDE ELEMENTS COMPREHENSIVE PLAN DISTRICT ELEMENTS ADOPTED 12/19/06 P. 1-317 needed to maximize the effectiveness of these upgrades (see “Regional Initiatives” text box at left 1307.2 See the Environmental Protection Element for policies and actions related to Low Impact Development, green roofs and other ways to reduce stormwater run-off. [BEGIN SIDEBAR] Regional Initiatives 1307.4 The District has participated in several Chesapeake Bay Stormwater Initiatives in the past few years. The Chesapeake 2000 Agreement, undertaken in partnership with the EPA, the Chesapeake Bay Commission, and Maryland, DC, and Virginia, resulted in a directive called "Managing Storm Water on State, Federal and District-Owned Lands and Facilities The directive called for better management of storm water on public lands and facilities, which comprise more than 13 percent of the Chesapeake Bay watershed. The ultimate goal is to prevent storm water problems resulting from increased development and to remediate storm water problems on lands that have already been developed. The 2001 Anacostia Watershed Restoration Agreement established new comprehensive goals for restoring water quality and living resources in the Anacostia basin. These goals include the creation of additional riparian forest buffers, decreasing impervious surface area through low impact development, and establishing active river advocacy groups in each major Anacostia subwatershed [END SIDEBAR] Policy IN-2.2.1: Improving Stormwater Management Ensure that stormwater is efficiently conveyed, backups are minimized or eliminated, and the quality of receiving waters is sustained. Stormwater management should be an interagency process with clear lines 320 of responsibility with regard to oversight, guidelines, and resources. 1307.3 Action IN-2.2-A: Stormwater Capital Improvements Continue the implementation of stormwater capital improvements as identified in the WASA Capital Improvement program. 1307.5 Action IN-2.2-B: Stormwater Management Responsibilities Develop an integrated process to manage stormwater that enhances interagency communication and formally assigns responsibility and funding to manage stormwater drainage. This process should include an appropriate funding mechanism to consistently maintain Clean Water standards and reduce surface runoff clear lines of responsibility with regard to which agency provides oversight, guidelines, and resources for the stormwater system and its management consistent and reliable funding sources to maintain Clean Water standards and reduce surface water runoff assurance that stormwater improvements associated with new development are coordinated with the WASA Capital Improvement Plan. 1307.6 IN-2.3 Combined Sewer System (CSS) 1308 As noted earlier, a portion of the District’s sewer system includes combined wastewater and stormwater pipes. This area encompasses about 12,600 acres—or one-third of the District’s land area (see Figure 13.3 A majority of this area was developed before 1900. 1308.1 CITYWIDE ELEMENTS COMPREHENSIVE PLAN DISTRICT ELEMENTS ADOPTED 12/19/06 P. 1-318 [INSERT Figure 13.3:Combined Sewer System Area 1308.5] In 2002, WASA developed a Long-Term Control Plan (LTCP) to eliminate Combined Sewer Outfalls and thereby improve water quality (see text box, next page A key component of the plan is the construction of four large tunnels which will allow runoff to be stored and then transported to the Blue Plains Wastewater Plant for treatment and gradual release. Two of the tunnels will be located near the Anacostia River, one will be near the Potomac River, and one will be near Rock Creek. The LTCP also includes separation of combined sewers in several sections of the District, consolidation and elimination of 13 of the 60 outfalls, and implementation of Low Impact Development (LID) practices at WASA facilities and across the District. The project will take 20 years to complete and has a projected construction cost of over $1.2 billion. 1308.2 When fully implemented, combined sewer overflows will be reduced by a projected 96 percent (98 percent on the Anacostia River resulting in improved water quality and less debris in local waterways. Overflow events would be reduced to two per year in the Anacostia River, four per year on the Potomac and Rock Creek, and one per year at Piney Branch. 1308.3 The LTCP provides for an effective balancing of cost, benefits and environmental protection that will greatly reduce CSO discharges. However, even with the full implementation of the LTCP, CSO discharges will still occasionally occur. Additional provisions to improve water quality will also be needed. 1308.4 See the Environmental Protection Element for additional information on sewer overflow conditions as well as the need to update the District’s water quality standards. Policy IN-2.3.1: Reducing CSO Outfalls Reduce the Combined Sewer Overflow (CSO) outfall to the region’s rivers by implementing 321 WASA’s Long Term Control Plan (LTCP 1308.6 Action IN-2.3-A: Rehabilitate Pumps Rehabilitate and maintain pump stations to support the LTCP and off-load stormwater in targeted combined sewer areas. 1308.7 Action IN-2.3-B: Federal Funding Pursue federal funding to cover an equitable share of the LTCP. Also, pursue funding from Maryland and Virginia and consider a graduated rate structure for DC residents as a water conservation initiative. 1308.8 [BEGIN SIDEBAR] The Long Term Control Plan 1308.9 The Combined Sewer System Long Term Control Plan (CSS LTCP July 2002) provides the District’s approach to reducing sewer overflows. Upon completion of the CSS LTCP improvements, existing overflows should be reduced by approximately 96 percent. The CSS LTCP that was originally scheduled to be implemented over the next 40 years is now being implemented over 20 years. WASA utilized financial planning models developed by the EPA to assess the long-term impacts of these improvements on customer rates. Key components of the LTCP include: CITYWIDE ELEMENTS COMPREHENSIVE PLAN DISTRICT ELEMENTS ADOPTED 12/19/06 P. 1-319 construction of storage tunnels, allowing storage and gradual release of CSO flows separation of the combined sewers in several sections consolidation and elimination of 13 outfalls pumping station improvements Low Impact Development.

[END SIDEBAR] IN-3.0 Solid Waste 1309 The District generates roughly 650,000 tons of Municipal Solid Waste (MSW) per year, which is collected and processed by both public and private facilities. Municipal Solid Waste consists of everyday items such as product packaging, food waste, furniture and other household items, clothing, and larger bulk items such as household appliances. The District Department of Public Works (DPW) Solid Waste Management Administration is responsible for waste collection services from all government entities and approximately 110,000 single-family homes and residential buildings with up to three living units. Private haulers handle trash from commercial and multi-family residential establishments, including condominium and apartment buildings with more than three units. Approximately 70 percent of the annual solid waste in the District is from commercial sources and multi-family residences, while 30 percent is generated from other residential uses and the government sector. 1309.1 In addition to waste collection, the DPW collects 5,000 tons of bulk trash and provides recycling service, household hazardous waste collection, leaf and yard waste collection, and dead animal removal. The DPW is also responsible for street and alley cleaning and solid waste education and enforcement. The DPW Office of Recycling is responsible for education, technical assistance, outreach, and enforcement. District recyclables are sorted at the Eagle Recovery Facility on North Capitol Street for sales and remanufacturing. The text box on the next page describes DC recycling regulations. 1309.2 See the Environmental Protection Element for information and policies on recycling and reducing the solid waste stream. 322 Many new landfills collect potentially harmful landfill gas emissions and convert the gas into energy. The EPA's Landfill Methane Outreach Program (LMOP) promotes the use of landfill gas as a renewable, green energy source. Landfill gas is primarily carbon dioxide and methane, both by-products of the decomposition of solid waste. While there are currently no landfill gas-to-energy (LFGE) projects or candidate landfills in the District, both Maryland and Virginia encourage and support such projects at landfills within those states. 1309.3 [BEGIN TEXT BOX] DC Recycling Regulations 1309.4 The District’s residential and commercial recycling programs are managed by DPW. Residential recycling is voluntary and includes a pickup on the same day as trash pick-up. Commercial recycling is required by law. Any premise not authorized to receive municipal trash and recycling collection services, CITYWIDE ELEMENTS COMPREHENSIVE PLAN DISTRICT ELEMENTS ADOPTED 12/19/06 P. 1-320 or containing a unit used for non-residential purposes, is considered a business or commercial establishment. Under DC law, all businesses located in the District must submit a bi-annual recycling plan to the Department of Public Works Office of Recycling and implement an ongoing recycling program. This program must include: separation of recyclables from other solid waste adequate number of containers for separated recyclables hiring a licensed, registered recycling hauler to regularly pick up recyclables (or, in certain circumstances, establishing a system where an entity may haul away its recyclables on its own) [END TEXT BOX] IN-3.1 Solid Waste Transfer Facilities 1310 An efficient solid waste transfer station system is essential for the District. There are currently five solid waste transfer facilities, three of which are privately owned and two of which are District operated. Map 13.1 on the next page shows the location of these stations. Approximately 60 percent of the District’s municipal solid waste is processed at the Fort Totten Station, and the remaining 40 percent is processed at the Benning road facility. All municipal solid waste is removed by truck from the area since there are no active incinerators or landfills in the District. Trash is loaded onto long-haul trailers for removal to landfills as far away as North Carolina. 1310.1 [INSERT Map 13.1: Trash Transfer Stations in the District of Columbia 1310.2] The Benning Road facility was recently renovated; the Department of Public Works estimates that it has a functional capacity of 2,000 tons per day. The Fort Totten facility is scheduled to undergo major repairs to improve building safety and operations, including environmental pollution control measures. Major improvements will include brickwork and masonry repair, replacement of foundations and roofs, repair of utility systems, and replacement of machinery. Once these improvements are completed, the District will be able to process more than 4,000 tons daily including trash that was formerly handled by privately operated trash transfer stations. The text box at left provides more information about trash transfer facilities. 1310.4 The District does not currently have a construction and demolition debris (C&amp;amp;D) transfer station, but it does permit disposal of a limited amount of C&amp;amp;D at the Fort Totten processing station. Large-scale commercial building debris disposal is handled privately. The majority of C&amp;amp;D is currently processed by several transfer stations in the surrounding areas of southern Maryland and northern Virginia. 1310.5 323 Policy IN-3.1.1: Solid Waste Collection Ensure safe, reliable, adequate solid waste collection from residences, business establishments, institutions and other facilities. 1310.6 Policy IN-3.1.3: Reducing Community Impacts Reduce the adverse effects of solid waste facilities, including noise, odors, and truck traffic, on District neighborhoods. 1310.7 Action IN-3.1-A: Upgrade Fort Totten Facility Upgrade the Fort Totten transfer facility to provide a fully enclosed, modern solid waste transfer station to meet the District's solid waste needs. Consider expansion of this facility to provide adequate space to CITYWIDE ELEMENTS COMPREHENSIVE PLAN DISTRICT ELEMENTS ADOPTED 12/19/06 P. 1-321 meet other solid waste needs, including vehicle storage, “white goods” such as washing machines, refrigerators and other large household appliances, and other special waste disposal. 1310.8 Action IN-3.1-B: Trash Transfer Regulations Enact regulatory changes that enable the private sector to provide more efficient trash transfer stations, be in compliance with enforceable regulations, and potentially provide a much needed state-of-the-art construction and demolition waste processing site under private operation and ownership. Work with ANCs and community organizations in drafting these regulations to ensure that neighborhood concerns are addressed. 1310.9 [BEGIN SIDEBAR] What Is a Solid Waste Transfer Facility? 1310.10 A solid waste transfer facility is a light industrial facility where trash collection trucks discharge their loads for compacting. Once compacted, trash is reloaded onto larger vehicles (e.g trucks, trains and barges) for shipment to a final disposal site. Transfer facilities are typically fully enclosed. Workers screen incoming wastes on the receiving floor or in an earthen pit, recovering materials from the waste stream that can be recycled and separating out any inappropriate wastes (e.g tires, large appliances, automobile batteries Transfer facility operators usually unload, compact, and transport waste off the site in a matter of hours. The District undertook a Needs Assessment and Site Selection Study for trash transfer stations in 2000- 2001 to assess the adequacy of existing facilities and determine how future needs might be met. Among the recommendations of the study were: Changes to siting and permitting requirements, including setback and buffering standards Upgrading of the Fort Totten and Benning Road transfer stations Development of drop-off facilities for residents at Fort Totten and Benning Road Further analysis of costs, needs, public education programs, and employee training initiatives. [END SIDEBAR] IN-4.0 Telecommunications 1311 Telecommunication is the transmission of information by wire, radio, optical cable, electromagnetic, or other means. The provision of high-quality digital infrastructure wireless networks, fiber optics, and broadband telecommunications is important to residents and businesses, and is vital to economic development. Such infrastructure is critical in the 21st century, particularly given the security and information needs of the national capital. 1311.1 The District’s Office of the Chief Technology Officer (OCTO) is responsible for improving, enhancing, and expanding wireless technology, communications systems, and electronic commerce in the 324 District. OCTO develops and enforces policies and standards for information technology in District government and identifies where and how technology can systematically support the business processes of the District's 68 agencies. 1311.2 OCTO has initiated DC-NET, a fiber optic telecommunications network supplying District consumers with complete voice, data, video and wireless communications services. The system consists of interconnected strands of optical plastic from various providers that, when completed, will connect the CITYWIDE ELEMENTS COMPREHENSIVE PLAN DISTRICT ELEMENTS ADOPTED 12/19/06 P. 1-322 majority of government and quasi-governmental services in the District. These include radio towers; police, fire and emergency management facilities; administrative buildings; public schools and libraries; recreation and community centers; District-owned hospitals and clinics; and semi-governmental entities such as WASA, WMATA and UDC. 1311.3 In order to elevate the stature of the District, the ‘City of Access’ initiative provides free Internet access and free or low-cost computer sites for DC residents. The initiative also aims to expand Internet access and technology training in DC neighborhoods by combining public and private institutional resources. 1311.4 IN-4.1 Planning and Coordination of Telecommunications Infrastructure 1312 Localities such as the District of Columbia can plan for and regulate telecommunications infrastructure within the limitations of Section 253 of the 1996 Telecommunications Act. The Act prohibits local governments from imposing statutes, regulations, or other barriers that would have the effect of prohibiting a telecommunications provider from entering the market. It defines the authority of local government to plan and regulate such attributes as facility location, height, setbacks, and safety standards. The Federal Communications Commission (FCC) has the overall responsibility for regulating the interstate and international telecommunications industry and has the ability to preempt local actions that do not conform to the provisions or the intent of the Act. 1312.1 In the District, the federal sector, local government, commercial industry, and general public rely heavily on radiofrequency services, facilities, and devices. In recent years, this demand has necessitated the location of new antennae on both federal and private land. The District Zoning Commission has established development standards for antenna towers and the National Capital Planning Commission has written guidelines for antennas on federal property in the National Capital Region. Both sets of guidelines govern the appropriate location of radiofrequency facilities for functional and aesthetic reasons, protecting the operational needs of federal installations and preserving parklands and important viewsheds. The planning regulations that govern the location of new antennas and towers for human health or safety are found in the Federal Elements of the Comprehensive Plan. These policies suggest joint use and co-location of antennae, interior attenuation devices, and prudent avoidance to high exposures of electromagnetic fields. 1312.2 Policy IN-4.1.1: Development of Communications Infrastructure Plan and oversee development and maintenance of communications infrastructure including cable networks, fiber optic networks, and wireless communications facilities to help support economic development, security, and education goals. 1312.3 Policy IN-4.1.2: Digital Infrastructure Accessibility Promote digital infrastructure that provides affordable broadband data communications anywhere, anytime to the residents of the District. Investigate the cost-effectiveness of providing municipally- 325 owned wireless broadband connectivity to guarantee more affordable high speed-internet access for residents, businesses, schools, and community organizations. 1312.4 Action IN-4.1-A: Guidelines for Siting/Design of Facilities Establish locational and design criteria for above-ground telecommunication facilities including towers, switching centers, and system maintenance facilities. In addition, establish provisions to put cables and wires underground wherever feasible. Consult with ANCs and community groups in the development of siting criteria. 1312.5 CITYWIDE ELEMENTS COMPREHENSIVE PLAN DISTRICT ELEMENTS ADOPTED 12/19/06 P. 1-323 See the Environmental Protection Element for additional policies and actions on the siting of telecommunication towers and transmission facilities. IN-5.0 Energy Infrastructure 1313 Although population has declined over the last 50 years, energy consumption in the District has remained relatively constant. Declines in residential use have been offset by growth in commercial use. Today, the commercial sector accounts for 62 percent (106 trillion Btu of energy used annually) of the District’s energy consumption, whereas the residential sector accounts for 20 percent (33.5 trillion Btu The transportation sector is the third largest energy consumer with 15.5 percent (26.5 trillion Btu The commercial sector energy usage in the District accounts for 80 percent of the dollars spent on energy in the city. 1313.1 IN-5.1 Electric Infrastructure 1314 Electricity is delivered to District consumers by electric generation, transmission, and distribution facilities. Power plants generate high voltage electricity, which is released along transmission lines into the power grid to substations located throughout the District. From the substations, distribution lines deliver the electricity to transformers on the ground or mounted on utility poles. The transformers reduce the voltage so it can be safely used by District consumers. Currently, the Potomac Electric Power Company (PEPCO) supplies 95 percent of the city’s residential customers and 79 percent of the city’s commercial customers; the remainder is provided by other suppliers. 1314.1 In the District, PEPCO operates two oil-fired power plants located at Benning Road (550 MW) and Buzzard Point (256 MW Oil has been the sole energy source used at these plants since coal was phased out in the mid-1970s. However, the dependence on generating stations in the city is not as prevalent as it used to be. Today, a majority of electricity supplied to District residents is generated by coal-fueled power plants in Maryland. In addition, with the emergence of cogeneration projects and purchased power over the last 20 years, the District has access to and takes advantage of 450 megawatts from utilities as far away as Ohio. 1314.2 [PULLQUOTE: Today, a majority of electricity supplied to District residents is generated by coal- fueled power plants in Maryland. In addition, with the emergence of cogeneration projects and purchased power over the last 20 years, the District has access to and takes advantage of 450 megawatts from utilities as far away as Ohio.] PEPCO plans to run the Benning Road and Buzzard Point power plants indefinitely. A significant PEPCO presence on other properties in the city will also be required for substations, fleet maintenance, and storage and service yards. The utility currently uses a 10-year planning horizon to estimate 326 substation capacity. Its latest ten-year forecast determined that two new substations will be needed to meet load growth needs through 2015. A new Northeast substation, to be located near the intersection of New York Avenue and Florida Avenue NE will provide additional capacity for the NoMA, Hechinger Mall/ Bladensburg Road, Rhode Island Avenue Metro, and H Street NE areas. A proposed Southeast substation near the Southeast Federal Center will provide additional substation capacity for the South Capitol Corridor, Buzzard Point, Waterside Mall, and the Southwest Waterfront areas. 1314.3 PEPCO is also increasing capacity at three existing substations by adding transformers and/or supplies. Existing substations will be expanded to serve growth along 7th Street, the U Street Corridor, Howard University Town Center, and Historic Anacostia. Beyond the ten-year horizon, PEPCO will site and CITYWIDE ELEMENTS COMPREHENSIVE PLAN DISTRICT ELEMENTS ADOPTED 12/19/06 P. 1-324 construct substations to relieve future overloads at stations that are approaching capacity and to respond to future growth needs. At this time, PEPCO cannot determine the locations of new substations beyond the ten-year horizon with any degree of certainty. 1314.4 Individual development projects and redevelopment on large sites will require new “feeder” lines to serve additional customers. Construction of these lines will impact existing development and infrastructure in a variety of ways. Underground distribution systems, which are typically required in new development, will require construction of new conduits, cables, and subsurface or pad-mounted transformers. Dense commercial or multi-family residential developments will often require the extension of new mainline underground feeder groups, potentially resulting in digging up of the streets and sidewalks. Public utility easements may also be needed to provide buried distribution systems inside multi-building developments. 1314.5 [Photo Caption: Pepco’s oil-powered plant at Benning Road.] Policy IN-5.1.1: Adequate Electricity Ensure adequate electric supply to serve current and future District of Columbia needs. This will require collaboration with PEPCO and other service providers. 1314.6 Policy IN-5.1.2: Undergrounding Electric Distribution Lines Plan for the undergrounding of electric distribution lines throughout the District to provide increased reliability of service and enhanced aesthetics and safety, and seek equitable means to cover the high costs associated with undergrounding. Use the opportunity for undergrounding to bury other above-ground communication lines, such as telephone lines, wherever feasible. 1314.7 See the Environmental Protection Element for information about the District’s Energy Emergency Plan and Comprehensive Energy Plan. IN-5.2 Gas Infrastructure 1315 Consumption of natural gas has remained stable for the past 25 years 30 trillion BTU even as petroleum and coal consumption have decreased dramatically. District consumers receive natural gas through transmission and distribution pipelines leading to compressor stations in and around the region. Regional Washington Gas compressor stations are located in the District, in Loudoun County and in Chillum, Maryland with additional Transco Natural Gas Compressor Stations in Manassas and Columbia. It is important to be ever vigilant about the need for natural gas safety given the potential hazards 327 associated with gas leaks. 1315.1 Policy IN-5.2.1: Natural Gas Safety Promote consumer education on the benefits of regular monitoring of all aboveground and buried natural gas piping on the customer’s side of the meter to prevent corrosion, leaking, and other safety hazards. 1315.2 CITYWIDE ELEMENTS COMPREHENSIVE PLAN DISTRICT ELEMENTS ADOPTED 12/19/06 P. 1-325 IN-6.0 Infrastructure and New Development 1316 This section addresses the need to plan for, coordinate, fund, and implement capital improvements to address existing deficiencies as well to address the impacts and cost of new development. 1316.1 IN-6.1 Coordinating and Funding Infrastructure Improvements 1317 One of the basic purposes of the Comprehensive Plan is to improve the linkage between development and capital improvement decisions. However, as this Element highlights, many of the infrastructure improvements required to serve development are funded by entities other than the District of Columbia. Interagency coordination is necessary to ensure that capacity remains adequate. Coordination with the private sector is also important. The general trend in cities and counties across the country has been for the development community to bear a greater share of the cost of infrastructure expansion, rather than leaving this burden to local taxpayers and ratepayers (see text box at left This is already common practice in the District and will continue to be so in the future, given the District’s already high tax rates and fiscal imbalance. 1317.1 Policy IN-6.1.1: Coordination of Infrastructure Improvements Ensure that infrastructure upgrades are carefully scheduled and coordinated with development and redevelopment plans in order to minimize traffic rerouting, pavement cuts for laying cable or placement of other infrastructure within the street right-of-way, street closings, disruptive subsurface excavation, and utility shut-offs. 1317.2 Policy IN-6.1.2: Creative Financing Promote creative financing tools to fund infrastructure maintenance and replacement. These could include innovative taxing programs, user fees, and new development charges. 1317.3 Policy IN-6.1.3: Developer Contributions Require that private developers fund the necessary relocation or upgrading of existing utilities to address limitations with existing infrastructure on or adjacent to proposed development sites. For necessary upgrades to water and wastewater infrastructure, developers should contribute to the cost of extending utilities to the project site or upgrading existing utilities to the specifications necessary for their proposed project. 1317.4 Action IN-6.1-A: Developer Reimbursement Agreement Formulate consistent, equitable, and manageable developer Reimbursement Agreements for the incremental costs of water, sewer, and other utility upgrades. The Agreements should provide a means for the initial developer to be reimbursed by the District through payments by other developers who benefit from the initial developer’s infrastructure improvements. 1317.5 Action IN-6.1-B: Coordination Of Infrastructure Upgrades Establish a central repository for data and schedules for planned infrastructure upgrades to minimize the need for repeated street and sidewalk excavation. 1317.6 [BEGIN SIDEBAR] 328 Paying for Infrastructure 1317.7 In general, local governments and/or independent agencies or authorities (e.g WASA, PEPCO) are responsible for the maintenance and upkeep of infrastructure. There are a number of ways that local CITYWIDE ELEMENTS COMPREHENSIVE PLAN DISTRICT ELEMENTS ADOPTED 12/19/06 P. 1-326 governments fund infrastructure improvements. The most common are long-term financing via bonds and “pay-as-you go” revenues collected via taxes or utility rates. In many cases, municipalities have foregone investment in infrastructure due to revenue constraints. The result is deferred maintenance and a long backlog of unfunded repairs—an unfortunate reality in cities across the country. Many local governments require infrastructure costs for new development to be borne by the developer through impact fees, special assessments, or other fees or taxes. Such fees are usually proportionate to the actual costs of building new water lines, sewer lines, and other utilities to serve the development site. While impact fees are effective to address the impacts of new development, they may not be used to address deferred maintenance. Those costs must be financed through other means—generally through higher rates that cover the cost of bonds and capital projects. [END SIDEBAR] CITYWIDE ELEMENTS COMPREHENSIVE PLAN DISTRICT ELEMENTS ADOPTED 12/19/06 P. 1-327 CHAPTER 14 ARTS AND CULTURE ELEMENT Overview 1400 The Arts and Culture Element provides policies and actions dedicated to the preservation and promotion of the arts in the District of Columbia. Its focus is on strengthening the role of the arts in shaping the physical form of our city. 1400.1 The key issues facing the District of Columbia as it seeks to foster and enhance arts and culture include Improving the distribution of arts facilities throughout the city Increasing public art in new and refurbished public construction Retaining existing clusters of arts establishments and encouraging the designation of new Arts Districts Creating a civic culture that attracts the creative class Washington is already one of the country’s leading cultural centers. Its breadth of artistic achievement encompasses many disciplines, cultures, individuals and organizations. The District is home to the Smithsonian Institution, several museums of fine art, and a world-class symphony, ballet, and opera. From the jazz clubs of U Street to the daily literary events at local bookstores, its neighborhoods also enjoy a cultural legacy that is distinctly Washington’s. Over the past decade, the District has consistently ranked among the top states in per capita spending on the arts. Among American cities, the city is second only to New York in the number of live theater seats. 1400.2 The Arts and Culture Element charts a course toward transforming the District into an even more vibrant cultural capital in the future than it is today. It acknowledges the contribution of the arts to the city’s economy and supports investment in the arts in order to provide new jobs, goods, and services. The Element also helps sustain the arts as an expression of local values and a source of community identity. Fostering the arts can help make Washington a more “Inclusive City” by helping all residents to express 329 and realize their creative potential. 1400.3 Arts and Culture Goal 1401 The overarching goal for arts and culture is as follows: Support and encourage arts and cultural venues, programs and learning experiences in the District of Columbia that inspire a vibrant cultural life for all segments of the population. Enhance the city’s diverse artistic and cultural traditions through decisions affecting the physical environment. 1401.1 [PULLQUOTE: Arts and Culture Goal The overarching goal for arts and culture is as follows: Support and encourage arts and cultural venues, programs and learning experiences in the District of Columbia that inspire a vibrant cultural life for all segments of the population. Enhance the city’s diverse artistic and cultural traditions through decisions affecting the physical environment.] CITYWIDE ELEMENTS COMPREHENSIVE PLAN DISTRICT ELEMENTS ADOPTED 12/19/06 P. 1-328 Policies and Actions AC-1.0 Creating and Enhancing Arts and Cultural Facilities 1402 The ability of arts organizations and artists to thrive in our city is dependent on having suitable production, performance, and exhibition space. The required facilities include studios, rehearsal halls, theaters and concert halls, dance rehearsal and performance spaces, exhibition spaces and galleries, multipurpose centers, classrooms, administrative offices, and art storage facilities, among others. Many of these facilities are completely absent in large parts of the city, especially in East of the River neighborhoods. Where they do exist, they may be threatened by rising rents and redevelopment pressure. 1402.1 AC-1.1 Expanding Neighborhood Arts and Cultural Facilities 1403 In the last few years, the District has made great strides in preserving, rehabilitating, and expanding arts facilities. In 2005 the GALA Hispanic Theatre moved into the newly refurbished Tivoli Theatre and the Woolly Mammoth Theater opened the doors of its first permanent home — a new 265-seat, courtyardstyle theatre in the heart of Downtown Washington. Even with the addition of such notable facilities, however, current supply may not meet demand. The city faces a persistent need for the retention and further development of affordable neighborhood arts facilities. A directed program of facility development, maintenance, and expansion is needed to foster a more stable arts community. 1403.1 Policy AC-1.1.1: Enhancement of Existing Facilities Preserve and enhance existing District-owned neighborhood arts and cultural spaces. Assist in the improvement of arts organizations’ facilities in order to enhance the quality and quantity of arts offerings. 1403.2 Policy AC-1.1.2: Development of New Cultural Facilities Develop new neighborhood cultural facilities across the District, providing affordable space for grass roots and community arts organizations. Provide technical and financial assistance to organizations to help plan and build such facilities. 1403.3 Policy AC-1.1.3: Distribution of Facilities Promote improved geographic distribution of arts and cultural facilities, including development of arts facilities and venues east of the Anacostia River and in other parts of the city where they are in short supply today. 1403.4 Policy AC-1.1.4: Cultural and Artistic Diversity Ensure that neighborhood cultural facilities accommodate a wide variety of arts disciplines, cultures, individuals and organizations. Facilities should also accommodate the special needs of seniors and persons with disabilities. 1403.5 330 Policy AC-1.1.5: Siting of Facilities Support the siting of arts facilities in locations where impacts upon nearby uses can be most easily managed. Give preference to locations near public transit, or sites where shared parking facilities are available. Conversely, ensure that appropriate parking and transit access improvements are made when arts and cultural venues are developed. 1403.6 CITYWIDE ELEMENTS COMPREHENSIVE PLAN DISTRICT ELEMENTS ADOPTED 12/19/06 P. 1-329 Policy AC-1.1.6: Performance and Events in Non-Traditional Settings Encourage the provision of spaces for performances and art events in neighborhood parks, community centers, schools, transit stations, residential developments and public areas in private development. This can help reach new audiences and increase access to the arts for people in all parts of the city. 1403.7 Policy AC-1.1.7: Inclusion of Arts in DC Main Streets Support the inclusion of arts and cultural facilities and arts-supportive businesses as part of the city’s neighborhood commercial revitalization programs. 1403.8 Policy AC-1.1.8: Using District-Owned Facilities Encourage the shared-use of District-owned facilities such as public schools, libraries, and recreation centers by artists and arts organizations. 1403.9 Action AC-1.1-A: Including Arts Spaces in Public Construction Consider regulatory changes that would encourage the provision of space for the arts in new and refurbished public buildings. Examples of such provisions would be the design of plazas so that they can be used as performance spaces or gallery lighting of lobbies so they can be used as exhibition space. 1403.10 Action AC-1.1-B: Theaters East of the River Pursue development of additional arts and cultural establishments, including theaters and cinemas, east of the Anacostia River. 1403.11 AC-1.2 Creating Arts Districts 1404 Arts Districts are identified, mixed-use areas of the city in which a high concentration of arts and cultural facilities serves as an anchor of attraction. The tendency of cultural activities to cluster together is born out of the energy and excitement that is generated when there is more than one activity occurring in a limited area. Theater, music and visual arts audiences grow when the opportunity for exposure to various cultures and cultural events is present, especially when those opportunities take place in geographic clusters. 1404.1 [PULLQUOTE: The tendency of cultural activities to cluster together is born out of the energy and excitement that is generated when there is more than one activity occurring in a limited area.] Promoting the formation of such clusters by creating Arts Districts not only provides value to art patrons, it also spurs creative collaboration among arts organizations and artists. It can result in inventive artistic products as well as cost savings through shared facilities and/or shared administrative functions. 1404.2 Arts Districts also have an economic development value. Retail shops, restaurants, and hotels find a ready market for their goods and services in Arts Districts. More than 90 cities in the United States have planned or implemented such districts, positioning the arts at the center of their urban revitalization efforts. In the District, the 7th Street corridor, which includes a number of art galleries, the Shakespeare Theater and the new Woolly Mammoth Theater, is a good example. The corridor has attracted a mix of uses including a number of restaurants, and retail establishments. 1404.3 Figure 14.1 shows the existing Arts Districts in Washington. These districts were established in the 331 early 1980's as part of a District-wide strategy to use the arts to improve the social and economic well- being of the city. Representatives from the executive and legislative branches of government, business, developers, the arts community, and the public at-large collaborated in their formation. 1404.4 CITYWIDE ELEMENTS COMPREHENSIVE PLAN DISTRICT ELEMENTS ADOPTED 12/19/06 P. 1-330 [INSERT Figure 14.1: Arts Districts, 2006 1404.11] Policy AC-1.2.1: Arts District Sustain the Downtown Arts District as the preeminent location in the city for region-serving arts venues, including theaters, galleries, and museums and encourage the development of additional arts districts throughout the city. 1404.5 Policy AC-1.2-2: Designate Arts Districts Identify, recognize, and support existing clusters of arts establishments and encourage the designation of such areas as Arts Districts. 1404.6 Action AC-1.2-A: Arts Overlay Zones Use zoning overlays to promote and sustain Arts Districts. Ensure that Arts overlay zones are consistent with other District zoning regulations and that incentives for arts-related uses are not precluded by other provisions of zoning. 1404.7 Action AC-1.2-B: Arts District Along Rhode Island Avenue Explore the feasibility of designating an Arts District along Rhode Island Avenue, capitalizing on the designation along the US 1 corridor in Prince George’s County (Mount Rainier, Brentwood, Hyattsville Creation of such a district would include incentives for arts facilities and live-work housing, particularly in Northeast DC. Ensure that regulations associated with this district, if created, are consistent with other District proposals for this corridor (including those identified in the Comprehensive Plan 1404.8 Action AC-1.2-C: Cultural Enterprise Zones Explore the feasibility of creating “Cultural Enterprise Zones” in which commercial and nonprofit cultural organizations have clustered office spaces, rehearsal and performance spaces, retail boutiques and galleries, and studio and living spaces for individual artists (see text box at left Use tax incentives and subsidies to attract cultural organizations and private investors to such areas. 1404.9 [BEGIN SIDEBAR] Cultural Enterprise Zones Cultural Enterprise Zones are specific geographic areas targeted for arts and cultural uses and activities. They encourage arts and cultural activities by offering tax advantages and incentives to arts establishments and supporting businesses locating within the zone boundaries. [END SIDEBAR] Action AC-1.2-D: Enforcement of Zoning Requirements Establish an inspection and enforcement program for Arts District zoning requirements, ensuring that such requirements (such as the display of art in store windows) are enforced after projects are constructed. This program should be part of the city’s overall zoning enforcement efforts. 1404.10 AC-2.0 Making Art More Visible 1405 A large number of US cities and government agencies have adopted policies to make art more visible in the design of public buildings, infrastructure, and even private development. As public art projects have become more diverse and challenging, there has also been a shift from using art merely as an embellishment for architecture to using art to create a sense of neighborhood identity and to provide 332 a CITYWIDE ELEMENTS COMPREHENSIVE PLAN DISTRICT ELEMENTS ADOPTED 12/19/06 P. 1-331 connection to local history and culture. Art projects document, celebrate, and define communities whose stories may once have been overlooked. This is particularly true in Washington, where public art tells not only the story of a city but also the story of a nation. 1405.1 Art of many genres has played an important role in building the civic culture of the District of Columbia. From monuments inspired by the Beaux-Arts movement to the evocative murals of Adams Morgan, art is an integral and visible part of our cityscape. We must continue to include public art as our city evolves— not only in “federal” Washington but also in our neighborhoods. 1405.2 [Photo caption: H Street overpass, a.k.a the “Hopscotch Bridge”] AC-2.1 Increasing Opportunities for Public Art 1406 Public art can provide beauty, visual interest, and a source of community pride. It can contribute to crosscultural understanding, and become a source of community dialogue and participation. It also brings economic benefits in the form of tourism and jobs for artists. While the most familiar forms of public art in the District are its more than 150 commemorative memorials, there are many other examples. Traditional definitions of public art have grown to include temporary installations as well as permanent art forms such as frescoes and tile murals. New directions in public art should encourage a diversity of media, so that all segments of the community can participate and be represented. 1406.1 Since 1986, the DC Commission on the Arts and Humanities has maintained a “DC Creates Public Art Program” that purchases, commissions, and installs artwork for public sites throughout the city. The program was established by legislation that allocates up to one percent of the District's adjusted Capital Budget for the commission and acquisition of artwork. Despite this initiative, broader efforts are needed to bring public art to communities where it is in short supply. 1406.2 Policy AC-2.1.1: Emphasizing Important Places with Art Use public art to strengthen the District’s identity as a local cultural and arts center. Public art should accent locations such as Metro stations, sidewalks, streets, parks and building lobbies. It should be used in coordination with landscaping, lighting, paving and signage to create gateways for neighborhoods and communities. 1406.3 Policy AC-2.1.2: Funding Public Art in Captital Improvement Projects Continue to set aside funds from the capital improvement project budget for public art and arts- related improvements. Ensure that these funds are actually spent on physical improvements rather than operations. 1406.4 Policy AC-2.1.3: Reuse of Vacant and/or Underutilized Buildings Support the temporary reuse of vacant and/or underutilized storefronts and other non-residential buildings for arts exhibition. 1406.5 Action AC-2.1-A: Public Art Master Plan Develop a Public Art Master Plan for the District. The Master Plan would set out a vision for public art, as well as basic principles for how public art can be integrated into the District’s architecture, gathering places, and natural landscapes. 1406.6 333 Action AC-2.1-B: Redevelopment of Old Convention Center Include substantial floor space for arts exhibition and outdoor space for the performing arts within the proposed redevelopment plans for the site of the former Washington Convention Center. 1406.7 CITYWIDE ELEMENTS COMPREHENSIVE PLAN DISTRICT ELEMENTS ADOPTED 12/19/06 P. 1-332 See the Central Washington Area Element for additional recommendations on the site of the former Washington Convention Center Action AC-2.1-C: New District Museum Conduct a feasibility study on re-establishing a City Museum with public and private support to serve as a showcase of District art, culture, and history, including archival records for the District of Columbia. The study should determine ways to recoup public investment in such a museum, what business model would work best for its operation, where it should locate, and how it should be funded. 1406.8 AC-2.2 Using Art to Express Neighborhood Identity 1407 Art and cultural events can help preserve the distinct history and identity of local neighborhoods. For example, the Friendship Arch near the Verizon Center accentuates the unique identity of the Chinatown neighborhood. Similarly, “Recalling History: Mount Pleasant's Art on Call Boxes” recreates scenes from the neighborhood's history, starting with the area's Native Americans and moving through the arrival of today's immigrants. Art and culture should continue to be used to create civic pride and identity in this way. 1407.1 Policy AC-2.2.1: Using Art to Create Identity Use art as a way to help neighborhoods express unique and diverse identities, promoting each community’s individual character and sense of place. 1407.2 Policy AC-2.2.2: Neighborhood Fairs Encourage neighborhood festivals of appropriate scale and location to showcase local culture. Such festivals should be planned and managed in a way that does not adversely affect neighborhood health, welfare, and safety. 1407.3 Policy AC-2.2.3: Heritage Trails Promote the diversity and history of the District’s unique neighborhoods through heritage trails. 1407.4 See also the Urban Design Element for policies and actions on streetscape and public realm improvements that reflect cultural and architectural history. AC-3.0 Arts and the Economy 1408 According to America for the Arts, America's nonprofit arts industry generates $134 billion in economic activity every year, including $53.2 billion in spending by arts organizations and $80.8 billion in eventrelated spending by arts audiences. These activities generated over $24 billion in local, state, and federal tax revenues. The Cultural Alliance of Greater Washington has estimated that the arts add $500 million to the area’s economy each year, not including the $750 million expended annually by the Smithsonian Institution. Locally as well as nationally, art means business. 1408.1 Artistic expression arises from a creative workforce with unique needs. This workforce includes those in such fields as writing, graphic design, advertising, architecture, and media, as well as those in the visual and performing arts. Persons in the creative professions generate technological innovation, cultivate change, and bring new ways of thinking to the city’s leading industries. Moreover, culturally diverse urban areas attract, retain and inspire talented people. This can improve economic competitiveness as 334 well as opportunities for artistic expression. Cities across the country have developed a variety of tools to support and retain their creative workforce. From Business Improvement Districts (BIDs) to the adoption CITYWIDE ELEMENTS COMPREHENSIVE PLAN DISTRICT ELEMENTS ADOPTED 12/19/06 P. 1-333 of artist-friendly zoning standards, planning practices can bolster the arts by supporting creative professionals. 1408.2 [PULLQUOTE: Persons in the creative professions generate technological innovation, cultivate change, and bring new ways of thinking to the city’s leading industries. Moreover, culturally diverse urban areas attract, retain and inspire talented people. This can improve economic competitiveness as well as opportunities for artistic expression.] AC-3.1 Housing for the Creative Workforce 1409 According to Census 2000, the District has a higher percentage of artists in its workforce than any other state in the country. Yet the city’s ability to sustain its artists is threatened by a lack of affordable real estate and suitable locations for studios, live-work space, and production facilities. Some artistic enterprises have already left the city for cheaper space in the suburbs. Businesses in the cultural and nonprofit sectors are particularly vulnerable to cost pressures due to their low profit margins, specialized needs, and entrepreneurial nature. 1409.1 Live-work spaces traditionally have consisted of converted warehouses and industrial buildings, with open floor plans that offer large, flexible workspaces. Such spaces may house activities like film processing, welding, amplified music, fired ceramics, and other uses that are not compatible with traditional residential development. This is problematic in the District, since the city has a limited supply of industrial buildings and the competition for these buildings is fierce. 1409.2 While the District clearly has many groups in dire need of affordable housing, the needs of the arts community should not be forgotten. Creative and effective solutions can be developed without diminishing the city’s resources for broader affordable housing programs. 1409.3 Policy AC-3.1.1: Affordable Artist Housing Include provisions for arts professionals in the District’s affordable housing programs. 1409.4 See also the Housing Element for additional policies and actions on affordable and workforce housing Policy AC-3.1.2: Live-Work Spaces Ensure that the District’s zoning and land use regulations support the development of live-work space for artists in a variety of settings around the city. 1409.5 Action AC-3.1-A: Zoning Amendments Conduct a review of planning, building, and zoning regulations as they relate to arts uses to a) permit and/or create incentives for joint living and work quarters for artists in new and existing structures; and (b) make it easier to use garages and accessory buildings on residential lots as studio spaces, provided that issues such as noise, fire safety, environmental protection, and parking can be addressed. 1409.6 See the Land Use Element for additional policies on home-based businesses [SIDEBAR: The Mather Building in downtown DC is an example of an affordable live-work space for artists. The building had been vacant for over a decade before the Cultural Development Corporation of DC and a private developer renovated it as condos, with the units on the building’s second two floors designated for artist live/work space. This development gave artists an opportunity to own their space at a very low cost and enabled them to remain in the District.] CITYWIDE ELEMENTS 335 COMPREHENSIVE PLAN DISTRICT ELEMENTS ADOPTED 12/19/06 P. 1-334 AC-3.2 Promoting Cultural Tourism 1410 Cultural tourism “is travel directed toward experiencing the arts, heritage, and special character of unique places.” This definition emerged from the 1995 White House Conference on Travel and Tourism, which declared United States involvement in this worldwide phenomenon a national priority – a way to link support of American cultural institutions with economic development goals for the nation. 1410.1 According to the Travel Industry Association of America, cultural tourism is the fastest growing segment of the tourism industry, representing 81 percent of domestic travelers. Based on survey data, 66 percent of the nation’s cultural travelers want to visit historic places and museums, while 45 percent want to participate in arts and cultural events. 1410.2 The District is rich in the kinds of experiences and places those visitors are seeking. While some of these places are well known—the streets of Georgetown or Capitol Hill, for instance—many are not. Places like the Fort Circle Parks, Historic Anacostia, and Brookland are rich in landmarks that are known to few outside the city. The visitor experience should be expanded to include the dozens of cultural attractions that exist beyond the monuments and museums of the National Mall. This will bring more visibility and revenues to local cultural institutions and new dollars to the city's neighborhoods. Additionally, the development of new museums and cultural facilities beyond the Monumental Core, as called for by NCPC’s Memorials and Museums Master Plan, can expand choices for visitors and provide growth opportunities for local tourism. 1410.3 Policy AC-3.2.1: Promoting Cultural Amenities Promote the development of cultural amenities “beyond the Mall” in an effort to more fully capitalize on the economic benefits of tourism for District residents, businesses, and neighborhoods. 1410.4 Policy AC-3.2.2: F Street Museum Corridor Encourage the siting of new museums and theaters along the F Street NW Corridor through Downtown, creating a second “tier” of cultural attractions that complements the National Mall and anchored by such attractions as the Spy Museum and the National Portrait Gallery. 1410.5 Action AC-3.2-A: Marketing Cultural Events Explore improvements to more effectively market cultural events in the city, for example, by partnering with the Cultural Alliance of Greater Washington to expand TICKETplace into a centralized box office for all arts performances and events in the city. 1410.6 AC-4.0 Increasing Support for the Arts 1411 The nonprofit arts are not entirely self-supporting. The income generated through ticket sales or by sales of artwork rarely equals the costs of production, leaving arts enterprises to look for other income sources. Individual artists have limited access to funding, and non-profit arts organizations face tough competition for affordable space. Cities all over the United States confront these challenges and continuously seek new sources of arts funding. Expanded local government funding is one approach, but there are many non-traditional approaches being explored. 1411.1 CITYWIDE ELEMENTS COMPREHENSIVE PLAN DISTRICT ELEMENTS ADOPTED 12/19/06 P. 1-335 Increasing support for the arts also requires that we instill an appreciation for the arts through 336 education. Arts education can nurture the creative and artistic talents of District residents, and can foster a love for the arts that may later translate into financial support and patronage. 1411.2 AC-4.1 Public Funding 1412 In the District of Columbia, the DC Commission on the Arts and Humanities is the primary public funding agency. It provides grants to individual artists and a wide variety of nonprofit organizations. The Commission is supported primarily by District government funds and federal block grants and other special funds awarded by the National Endowment for the Arts. In addition, the Commission receives charitable contributions and donations through the Arts and Humanities Enterprise Fund. In recent years, revenues totaling close to $1.2 million have been raised through auctions and merchandise sales from special projects such as Party Animals and Pandamania. The District also maintains a dedicated revenue stream from its capital budget to support the development of arts facilities. 1412.1 Policy AC-4.1.1: Making Funding Inclusive Ensure that city funding for the arts occurs through a fair and transparent process and supports the delivery of services to the broadest possible spectrum of the community, with a particular emphasis on underserved communities. 1412.2 Policy AC-4.1.2: Granting Cost Reductions and Exemptions Reduce or eliminate, whenever possible, city-imposed costs associated with producing the arts by nonprofit organizations and educational institutions. Explore off-setting costs for business licenses and permits, property taxes, insurance, and rents for the use of city facilities, among others. 1412.3 AC-4.2 Partnerships 1413 Given the limits of public funding, support for the arts has increasingly relied on partnerships with the corporate and institutional sectors. This shift has been accompanied by a growing interest in the arts by the business sector. Audiences for the arts are often the very markets that businesses are trying to reach. 1413.1 The trend toward partnerships has provided the arts with new resources for programs and operations. These include both funding and contributions of in-kind goods and services. The District can help support and expand these links through its economic development programs and through the activities of the Commission on Arts and Humanities. It can also help build partnerships with organizations like the National Endowment for the Arts, local philanthropic organizations and foundations, and our colleges and universities. 1413.2 Here in the District there is a history of civic volunteerism. This extends to cultural leadership through diverse non-profit arts, cultural organizations, and regional advocacy organizations such as the Cultural Alliance of Greater Washington. Stronger collaboration among these organizations and other city and federal agencies is needed to maximize our resources and broaden the reach of arts and culture. 1413.3 Policy AC-4.2.1: Private Sector Partnerships Develop partnerships with the private sector to encourage monetary and non-monetary support for the arts, as well as sponsorships of arts organizations and events. 1413.4 CITYWIDE ELEMENTS COMPREHENSIVE PLAN DISTRICT ELEMENTS ADOPTED 12/19/06 P. 1-336 Policy AC-4.2.2: Partnerships Among Organizations Promote the creation of partnerships among the District and federal governments, local businesses, arts 337 organizations, schools, college and university art programs and departments, and charitable foundations to enhance arts programming, funding and facility development. 1413.5 Policy AC-4.2.3: Colleges and Universities Recognize the contribution of local colleges and universities to arts and culture in the city and promote continued collaboration to develop additional arts facilities and programs serving the broader community. 1413.6 AC-4.3 Engaging the Arts Community in Planning 1414 Building a stronger constituency for the arts will require engaging the arts community more effectively in local planning. Since 1968, the DC Commission on Arts and Humanities (COAH) has been a vehicle for artists and creative professionals from across the city to advocate for policies that expand cultural awareness and opportunity. Strengthened relationships between the COAH and other city agencies can lead to clearer, more integrated, and ultimately more successful results. By organizing and mobilizing the arts community, the District can also work toward greater support from arts patrons from across the entire metropolitan area, and not just those living in the District. 1414.1 [PULLQUOTE: By organizing and mobilizing the arts community, the District can also work toward greater support from arts patrons from across the entire metropolitan area, and not just those living in the District.] Policy AC-4.3.1: Engaging Our Arts Community Increase the involvement of the arts community in the design of the physical environment, and include artistic considerations in local planning and redevelopment initiatives. 1414.2 Policy AC-4.3.2: Role of the Commission on Arts and Humanities Maintain and strengthen the DC Commission on Arts and Humanities so that it can better serve the public through arts policy coordination, planning, and programming. 1414.3 Policy AC-4.3.3: Collaboration with Historic Preservation Organizations Encourage non-profit and private arts organizations to work closely with historic preservation organizations to reuse historical buildings, including historic theaters, as cultural centers. 1414.4 Policy AC-4.3.4: Coordination with Other Jurisdictions Encourage other jurisdictions in the region to help sustain and enhance the cultural facilities located within the city that serve the region as a whole. 1414.5 AC-4.4 Increasing Arts Awareness and Education 1415 The arts play a crucial role in improving students' ability to learn and can have a significant effect on a child’s overall success in school. Research studies point to strong relationships between arts education and basic cognitive skills used in other core subjects, including reading, writing, and math. Experiencing art can be especially beneficial for students from economically disadvantaged neighborhoods and can provide intellectual, personal, and social development benefits. Despite these benefits, arts programs are often the first to go when budgets are cut. 1415.1 The need for arts education is not confined to school children—art is critical at all levels of human development. Ongoing access to the arts—through classes, museum programs, tours, discussions, and CITYWIDE ELEMENTS COMPREHENSIVE PLAN DISTRICT ELEMENTS ADOPTED 12/19/06 P. 1-337 other means—can enrich one’s quality of life. Lifelong participation in the arts can create a broader understanding of the world around us and heightened awareness of other cultures and global issues. 1415.2 338 Policy AC-4.4.1: Arts Education Programs Build a stronger constituency for the arts in the District through arts education in K-12 schools including attendance at arts performances and art exhibitions, and support of adult art programs for persons of all ages and backgrounds. City resources should be used to help promote the strong and diverse arts programs offered by our public schools. 1415.3 Policy AC-4.4.2: Partnerships with Educational Institutions Strengthen collaborations among artists, arts organizations, teachers, school administrators and others to expand the resources of the arts community and broaden the reach of arts and culture. 1415.4 Policy AC-4.4.3: Arts Awareness for Special Populations Groups Provide accessible arts information resources to non-English speaking residents, seniors, and visually and hearing impaired populations. 1415.5 Policy AC-4.4.4: Participation of Artists Support and increase the participation of artists in the District’s arts education programs. 1415.6 CITYWIDE ELEMENTS COMPREHENSIVE PLAN DISTRICT ELEMENTS ADOPTED 12/19/06 P. 1-338 This page left intentionally blank AREA ELEM ENTS COM PREHENSIVE PLAN D ISTRICT ELEM ENTS ADOPTED 12/19/06 P. 2-1 CHAPTER 15 CAPITOL HILL AREA ELEMENT [Final document will be reflowed so that Section 1600 becomes Section 1500, etc.] Overview 1600 The Capitol Hill Planning Area encompasses the 3.1 square miles located east of the U.S. Capitol, north of I-695, and south of Florida Avenue and Benning Road. Boundaries of the Planning Area are shown in the Map at left. Most of this area has historically been Council Ward 6, although in past decades parts have been included in Wards 2 and 5. 1600.1 The Planning Area is bounded on the west by Central Washington and on the south by the Anacostia Waterfront. Because plans for these two areas are of particular concern to Capitol Hill residents, this chapter includes cross-references to relevant sections of the Central Washington and Lower Anacostia Waterfront/Near Southeast Area Elements. Changes along the waterfront—particularly at Reservation 13 and in the Near Southeast—are extremely important to the future of Capitol Hill. 1600.2 In many respects, Capitol Hill is a “city within the city.” The community has well defined physical boundaries that enhance its sense of identity. Its neighborhoods are united by history, architectural tradition and relatively consistent urban form, including a system of grid and diagonal streets that has remained faithful to the 1791 L’Enfant Plan for Washington. Much of the community has the feel of a small historic town, with block upon block of attractive late 19th century and early 20th century row houses, well-maintained public spaces, historic schoolhouses and corner stores, rear yard alleys, and traditional neighborhood shopping districts. The community’s attractive housing stock, living history, low scale, and proximity to the U.S. Capitol make “the Hill” one of the District’s most celebrated and attractive communities. 1600.3 Capitol Hill is comprised of several distinct neighborhoods. The original Capitol Hill neighborhood was developed on the high ground just east of the U.S. Capitol building during the 1800s and is still the historic heart of the community. The Lincoln Park and Stanton Park neighborhoods developed around their namesake squares with similar housing stock and street patterns. Areas such as Hill East, 339 Northeast Capitol Hill, Kingman Park, and Rosedale have their own sense of identity, shaped by such factors as geography, housing stock, architecture, public schools and parks, and commercial centers. Rosedale, for example, is characterized by wood-frame row houses (rather than brick smaller lots, and less uniform architecture. Other parts of the Hill include concentrations of flats and small apartments, including publicly subsidized housing complexes like Potomac Gardens. 1600.4 The major business districts in the Capitol Hill Planning Area are located along the east-west avenues that cross the community, particularly Pennsylvania Avenue, Massachusetts Avenue, and H Street NE. Historically, some of the north-south streets also supported neighborhood commercial districts, including 8th Street, 11th Street, and 15th Street. Among these, only the 7th Street/ 8th Street SE (Barracks Row) business district remain active today; the others have declined or been replaced by housing as shopping patterns and transportation conditions have changed. As an older urban neighborhood, there continue to be small neighborhood commercial uses such as dry cleaners, beauty salons, and corner stores across the Planning Area. Capitol Hill is also home to Eastern Market, a lively and historic public market where independent vendors sell fresh meats, vegetables, flowers, and other goods to customers from across the city. 1600.5 [Photo Caption: Capitol Hill is the largest residential historic district in the city.] AREA ELEM ENTS COM PREHENSIVE PLAN D ISTRICT ELEM ENTS ADOPTED 12/19/06 P. 2-2 The Capitol Hill area has an excellent transportation network, making auto ownership an option rather than a necessity for many households. The scale and topography of the neighborhood, as well as wide sidewalks and street trees, create ideal conditions for walking. The southeast portion of the Hill is served by the Capitol South, Eastern Market, Potomac Avenue, and Stadium-Armory Metro stations. Arterials like Pennsylvania Avenue and East Capitol Street provide excellent east-west circulation. The downside, however, is that Capitol Hill neighborhoods suffer from heavy volumes of commuter traffic going to and from areas east of the Anacostia River. The community is also easily accessed by I-295 and the Southeast/Southwest Freeway (I-695 1600.6 Capitol Hill is home to several parks, including Lincoln and Stanton Squares, Rosedale and Sherwood Recreation Centers, and many smaller pocket and triangle parks. It is also home to the 25-acre Congressional Cemetery, a national historic landmark. The largest parks serving the Hill neighborhoods are along the Anacostia River, including West Anacostia Park and the lands north of RFK Stadium. 1600.7 Much of the community’s distinctive character is protected as a National Register historic district; in fact, Capitol Hill is the largest residential historic district in the city and includes some 8,000 structures mostly dating from 1850 to 1915. The historic district includes 19th century manor houses, Federal townhouses, small frame dwellings, Italianate rowhouses, and pressed brick rowhouses, often with whimsical decorative elements. Many of the row houses have rentable English basement units, contributing to neighborhood diversity and affordability. Increased home values and an influx of higher income professionals have increased the buying power of area residents and have helped to revitalize 340 commercial corridors. But housing options for lower income and working class families have been shrinking, especially in the last five years. The tightening housing market has also impacted the many Congressional interns and young staffers who have historically relied on the Hill’s moderately priced rental housing. 1600.8 Capitol Hill has always had an active and involved citizenry. The Capitol Hill Restoration Society was founded in 1955 to protect the historic fabric of the Hill neighborhood. Their efforts led to the designation of the Capitol Hill historic district in 1976. Other neighborhood groups, like the Stanton Park Neighborhood Association, North Lincoln Park Neighborhood Association, Near Northeast Citizens Against Crime and Drugs, the Barney Circle Neighborhood Association, the Kingman Park Civic Association, and Hill East Waterfront Action Network, are committed to ensuring the livability of their neighborhoods. Business organizations like the Capitol Hill Association for Merchants and Professionals, Barracks Row and H Street Main Streets, Capitol Hill Business Improvement District, and Penn East Alliance all work tirelessly to ensure that the Hill is a great place to shop, work, visit, and live. 1600.9 [PULLQUOTE: Capitol Hill has always had an active and involved citizenry. The Capitol Hill Restoration Society was founded in 1955 to protect the historic fabric of the Hill neighborhood. Their efforts led to the designation of the Capitol Hill historic district in 1976.] Context History 1601 The Capitol Hill Planning Area has played an important role in the growth of the nation’s capital since the 1700s. The neighborhood itself takes its name from what was once called “Jenkins Hill.” It was here that Pierre L’Enfant sought to locate the “Congress House” or U.S. Capitol Building. L’Enfant’s original vision was that Washington’s major commercial street would extend eastward from the Capitol to the AREA ELEM ENTS COM PREHENSIVE PLAN D ISTRICT ELEM ENTS ADOPTED 12/19/06 P. 2-3 Anacostia River. A deepwater port on the river would become the city’s center of commerce. The eastern section of L’Enfant’s grand design failed to materialize, however, and the city developed to the west. However, the Hill was to achieve its own unique identity. 1601.1 During the city’s early years, privately owned buildings were constructed close to the Capitol, and occupied by artisans and craftsmen. The Navy Yard, to the south of the Capitol, also attracted development. By the time the British burned the Capitol building in 1814, a small community had been established on the Hill. Capitol Hill had cemeteries, an outdoor market, churches, hotels, and taverns. Boarding houses were constructed for members of Congress. 1601.2 At the beginning of the Civil War in 1861, only a few blocks east of the Capitol and south near the Navy Yard had been developed. Most streets were unpaved. Shanties stood side by side with more substantial wood frame and brick dwellings. Horse drawn streetcars served the Hill and the Navy Yard, and connected these areas to the Capitol and Downtown. 1601.3 [Photo caption: Lincoln Park] The neighborhood began to expand after the Civil War. The city had endured and prospered, and investment increased. During the last quarter of the 19th century, brick row houses were built north and east of the Capitol, new stores and banks were established, and streets were graded and paved. A major public works program gave the city—and Capitol Hill—a municipal water supply and sewerage system. A mix of ethnic groups settled in the community, including Italians, Germans, and African- 341 Americans. 1601.4 By the late 1800s, there were houses as far as Lincoln Park, where the Emancipation statue was erected in 1876. Philadelphia Row, completed in 1866 on 11th Street SE, was one of the first large-scale developments in the area. Senators, congressmen, and other public officials lived in the elegant homes around Lincoln Park and along East Capitol Street. More modest homes supported a growing middle class, employed at the Navy Yard and at the federal buildings around the U.S. Capitol. The area’s growth was spurred by the construction of electric streetcar lines in the early 1900s, also giving rise to commercial districts like H Street. 1601.5 The Hill has gone through several cycles of decline and renewal during the last century. During the 1920s, the federal government began renting out many of the houses on Capitol Hill. The neighborhood became less fashionable than the burgeoning area northwest of Downtown, and some of its more prominent residents relocated. By the late 1920s, the National Capital Parks and Planning Commission had developed plans for an eastward extension of the National Mall, extending from the Capitol to the Anacostia River. While these plans were not carried out, housing conditions on the Hill continued to deteriorate through the Great Depression and World War II. The 1950 Comprehensive Plan identified much of the neighborhood as “obsolete” or “blighted.” Congress funded public housing construction in response, and additional blocks around the Capitol were replaced with new federal offices. 1601.6 Parts of Capitol Hill were already being “gentrified” by the 1950s. Many turn-of-the-century row homes on the blocks just east of the Capitol were restored, bringing a renaissance to close-in neighborhoods. However, the recovery was uneven and was slower to arrive on the eastern edge of the Hill. Parts of the area continued to decline through the 1960s, and H Street was devastated by the 1968 riots. Most of Capitol Hill remained a stable, diverse, economically and racially mixed community through the 1980s and 1990s. Population decline was not as steep as it was in the neighborhoods to the north and east, and the community has remained consistently strong through difficult as well prosperous times. 1601.7 AREA ELEM ENTS COM PREHENSIVE PLAN D ISTRICT ELEM ENTS ADOPTED 12/19/06 P. 2-4 Land Use 1602 Land use statistics for the Capitol Hill Planning Area appear in Figure 15.1. Capitol Hill comprises 1,959 acres, or about five percent of the city’s land area. 1602.1 [INSERT Figure 15.1: Land Use Composition in the Capitol Hill Area 1602.6] [Figure updated to reflect Planning Area boundaries. Pie “slices” now as follows: Residential-30 Comm/ Ind -5 Parks/Open Space-15%,Public Facilities 4 Federal-2%,Streets-39 Institutional- 2 Vacant-3%] Capitol Hill contains more land in streets and street rights-of-way (39 percent) than any of the city’s 10 Planning areas. This is due to the broad avenues of the L’Enfant Plan, the regularity of the street grid, the extensive system of alleys, and the wide street rights-of-way. 1602.2 Residential uses account for 30 percent of the total. Of the 573 acres of residential land use on Capitol Hill, 520 acres are developed with row houses. Despite the low physical profile of the row houses, overall densities exceed the citywide average and are about 40 units per acre. 1602.3 Commercial uses represent about five percent of the total area, which is comparable to the citywide average. Major commercial areas include H Street, Pennsylvania Avenue, Benning Road, and 8th 342 Street SE. There is almost no industrial development in the community. 1602.4 Open space and parks comprise fifteen percent of the Planning Area The larger open spaces serving the neighborhood are along the Anacostia River, including Congressional Cemetery and the land north of RFK Stadium. Public facilities, primarily local public schools, public charter schools, and the DC Jail and former DC General Hospital complex, comprise four percent of the area. Institutional uses comprise two percent of the total area. In 2005, about three percent of the Planning Area consisted of vacant, developable land. 1602.5 Demographics 1603 Basic demographic data for Capitol Hill is shown in Table 15.1. In 2000, the area had a population of 47,600, or about 8 percent of the city’s total. Population declined by 8 percent during the 1990s. However, the number of households actually increased by 4 percent during the same period, as average household size dropped from 2.30 to 2.06. The drop in household size was steeper here than in city as a whole, indicating a growing number of one- and two-person households. On the other hand, the percentage of children and seniors in the Planning Area was virtually the same in 2000 as it was in 1990. 1603.1 Today, the percentage of children in the Planning Area is slightly less than the citywide average, while the percentage of seniors is about the same as the citywide average. About 47 percent of the Planning Area’s residents lived in the same house in 2000 as they did in 1995. This is about the same as the citywide average of 46.9 percent. About 10 percent of the Planning Area’s population resides in group quarters—a majority of this population is associated with the DC Jail.1603.2 Capitol Hill’s racial composition is similar to the city as a whole. Approximately 59 percent of the Planning Area’s residents are African-American and approximately 36 percent are White. These compare to citywide percentages of 60 percent and 30 percent. About 2 percent of the Hill’s residents are Asian and 1.5 percent are multi-racial. Only 5.3 percent of the area’s residents are foreign-born, and only 2 percent are of Hispanic Origin. Both of these figures are less than the citywide averages. 1603.3 AREA ELEM ENTS COM PREHENSIVE PLAN D ISTRICT ELEM ENTS ADOPTED 12/19/06 P. 2-5 Table 15.1: Capitol Hill at a Glance 1603.4 Basic Statistics Land Area (square miles) 3.1 Population 1990 51,755 2000 47,605 2005 (estimated 47,600 2025 (projected 55,200 Households (2005 21,600 Household Population (2005 exc lude s group qua rters 43,500 Persons Per Household (2005 2.01 Jobs (2005 17,880 Density (persons per sq mile 2005 15,400 Year 2000 Census Data Profile Capitol Hill Planning Area Citywide Total of Total of Total Age Under 18 7,454 15.7 20.0 18-65 35,138 73.8 67.8 Over 65 5,013 10.5 12.2 Residents Below Poverty Level 7,560 15.9 20.2 Racial Composition White 17,350 36.4 30.4 Black 28,091 59.0 60.3 Native American 147 0.3 0.3 Asian/ Pacific Islander 804 1.7 2.6 343 Other 514 1.1 2.8 Multi-Racial 699 1.5 5.2 Hispanic Origin 1,375 1.9 7.8 Foreign-Born Residents 2,528 5.3 12.8 Tenure Owner Households 10,812 50.3 40.7 Renter Households 10,685 49.7 59.3 Population 5+ yrs in same house in 2000 as in 1995 21,460 47.2 46.9 Housing Occupancy Occupied Units 21,497 89.2 90.4 Vacant Units 2,591 10.8 9.6 Housing by Unit Type 1-unit detached 1,019 4.2 13.1 1-unit attached 12,922 53.6 26.4 2-4 units 4,885 20.3 11.0 5-9 units 1,347 5.6 8.0 10-19 units 1,576 6.5 10.3 20-49 units 1,158 4.8 7.4 50+ units 1,048 4.4 23.3 Mobile/ other 133 0.6 0.2 Figures noted with an asterisk are estimates developed by the Office of Planning and Department of Employment Services based on a variety of data sources Total population of subcategories may not match 2000 Census totals due to sampling errors. AREA ELEM ENTS COM PREHENSIVE PLAN D ISTRICT ELEM ENTS ADOPTED 12/19/06 P. 2-6 Housing Characteristics 1604 The 2000 Census reported that 54 percent of the homes in the Capitol Hill Planning Area were row houses. This is more than double the citywide average of 26 percent. Only 4.2 percent of the housing units were single family detached homes, compared to 13 percent for the city as a whole. The area also contained fewer units in large apartment buildings than the city as a whole. Only nine percent of Capitol Hill’s housing units were in buildings with more than 20 units, compared to 30 percent citywide. Conversely, Capitol Hill has more units in 2-4 unit buildings than the city as a whole—more than 20 percent in 2000 (compared to a citywide average of 11 percent 1604.1 The 2000 Census reported that 10.8 percent of the housing units in the Planning Area were vacant. This is a reduction from the 1990 rate of 11.9 percent. The 2000 vacancy rate is comparable to the citywide rate of 9.6 percent. 1604.2 About half of all Capitol Hill households are homeowners and half are renters. The percentage of owners rose from 48.2 percent in 1990 to 50.3 percent in 2000, while the percentage of renters fell from 51.8 percent to 49.7 percent. Capitol Hill has a higher home ownership rate than the city as a whole. 1604.3 [Photo Caption: Approximately 54 percent of the housing units in the Capitol Hill Planning Area are row houses] Income and Employment 1605 Data from the Department of Employment Services and the Office of Planning indicate there were about 17,900 jobs in the Capitol Hill Planning Area in 2005, primarily in local-serving businesses, public schools, and government. This represents just two percent of the city’s job base. However, the Planning Area is surrounded on the west and south by large employment centers, including the US Capitol Complex, and the Southeast Federal Center. Data from the 2000 Census indicates that 37 percent of the jobs within the Capitol Hill Planning Area were held by District residents. Some 48 percent of the jobs were held by Maryland commuters, 13 percent by Virginia commuters, and 2 percent by residents claiming other areas as their home. 1605.1 In 2000, the Census indicated the median income in the Planning Area was $51,698. This is higher 344 than the citywide average. Nonetheless, 15.7 percent of the residents lived below the federal poverty level and the percentage of residents living in poverty actually increased from 13.6 percent in 1990. Most employed residents in the Planning Area worked in the District of Columbia. 2000 Census “journey to work” data indicates that 41 percent of the area’s residents commuted to Central Washington, 22 percent commuted to other locations in the District and nine percent worked within the Capitol Hill Planning Area. Some 7 percent of the area’s employed residents walked or bicycled to work, while 28 percent used public transit. 1605.2 Projections 1606 Based on land availability, planning policies, and regional growth trends, the Capitol Hill Planning Area is expected to see a modest increase in its population during the next 20 years. The number of households is projected to increase from 21,600 in 2005 to 25,400 in 2025, with an attendant 16 percent increase in population from 47,600 to about 55,200. Much of the growth is expected to consist of medium density mixed use development along H Street NE, consistent with the approved H Street Small Area Plan. Medium density mixed use development is also currently taking place around the Potomac Avenue Metro station. The land use pattern in most of the Planning Area is well established, however, with only limited AREA ELEM ENTS COM PREHENSIVE PLAN D ISTRICT ELEM ENTS ADOPTED 12/19/06 P. 2-7 opportunities for new development. Capitol Hill’s population growth represents about seven percent of the total growth expected in the District of Columbia over the next 20 years. 1606.1 [PULLQUOTE: Based on land availability, planning policies, and regional growth trends, the Capitol Hill Planning Area is expected to see a modest increase in its population during the next 20 years. The number of households is projected to increase from 21,600 in 2005 to 25,400 in 2025, with an attendant 16 percent increase in population from 47,600 to about 55,200.] The number of jobs is projected to increase from about 17,900 today to about 21,900 in 2025. Most of the increase is expected to take place on Reservation 13 and along H Street, as new retail and cultural uses locate on the revitalized corridor. Additional job growth may also take place on Pennsylvania Avenue; for example, a grocery store is currently under construction as part of the Jenkins Row mixed use project near Potomac Avenue. 1606.2 Planning and Development Priorities 1607 Several Comprehensive Plan workshops took place in the Capitol Hill Planning Area during 2005 and 2006. These meetings provided an opportunity for residents to discuss both citywide and neighborhood planning issues. There were also well-attended briefings to the Capitol Hill Restoration Society, the Capitol Hill Association of Merchants and Professionals, and the local Advisory Neighborhood Commissions. In addition, recent Small Area Plans—including the H Street Planning program and the Reservation 13 planning process—involved many Hill residents and addressed long-range planning issues 345 such as land use, traffic, housing needs, and public facilities. 1607.1 The community delivered several key messages during these meetings. These are summarized below. 1607.2 (a) Capitol Hill residents are concerned about the effects of growth on quality of life and community character. One resident described the neighborhood as being in the “vice grip” of development, noting that large-scale changes were planned on the northwest flank (in NoMA the eastern flank (at Reservation 13 and the southern flank (the Near Southeast and Stadium Areas Although changes in the heart of Capitol Hill during the next 20 years will be limited, development on the perimeter will generate traffic, increased demand for community services, and the potential for land use conflicts. These issues must be dealt with proactively, recognizing that the Hill is a fine-grained 19th century neighborhood that has evolved over two centuries. In some respects this is a testament to its endurance, but in other respects the neighborhood remains fragile and vulnerable to change. Conflicts between the booming NoMA area and nearby row house neighborhoods are of particular concern. [PULLQUOTE: Capitol Hill residents are concerned about the effects of growth on quality of life and community character. One resident described the neighborhood as being in the “vice grip” of development, noting that large-scale changes were planned on the northwest flank (in NoMA the eastern flank (at Reservation 13 and the southern flank (the Near Southeast and Stadium Areas).] (b) In addition to concerns about development on the perimeter, there is unease about the effects of future infill development within the neighborhood itself. Over the next 20 years, additional measures may be needed to conserve the moderate density row house character that defines most Capitol Hill neighborhoods. This could include the designation of additional areas as historic districts and further limits on alley closures. Future development should be directed to the H Street corridor and to a limited number of Metro-accessible sites along the Pennsylvania Avenue corridor. These areas are already zoned for commercial use and their redevelopment could reinforce the fabric of the neighborhood and provide AREA ELEM ENTS COM PREHENSIVE PLAN D ISTRICT ELEM ENTS ADOPTED 12/19/06 P. 2-8 needed housing and retail services. The renewal of H Street, in particular, has been long awaited. Conversely, the “upzoning” of developed residential land should be avoided, recognizing that the Hill is already one of the densest communities in the District of Columbia c) Historically, Capitol Hill has had a large number of older schoolhouses and public works buildings. Some of these facilities, like the Bryan School on Independence Avenue and the streetcar barn on East Capitol Street, have been adaptively reused for housing. Such reuse has preserved important architectural landmarks; however, there are concerns that surplus schools and public buildings will be demolished and replaced with much higher-density housing in the future. Residents at Comp Plan meetings were clear that any future development on surplus public property should conform to the prevailing density and architectural fabric of the surrounding community. There is a particular interest in retaining row houses and building new row houses to keep the Hill an attractive place for families. The redevelopment of the Ellen Wilson and Kentucky Courts public housing projects were both sited as a positive examples, to be emulated elsewhere d) Compared to neighborhoods in Northwest Washington, Capitol Hill is underserved by retail stores and services. Basic neighborhood services, like groceries, hardware stores, clothing stores, drug stores, movie theaters, banks, and restaurants, are in short supply in the commercial districts, and 346 many residents travel to Pentagon City or elsewhere to shop. On the other hand, the community has long sought to control the proliferation of drive-through fast food restaurants and mini-marts along thoroughfares like Pennsylvania Avenue. As much-needed retail is finally arriving on Capitol Hill, new issues have emerged. For example, Barracks Row is seeking to balance its role as a local-serving shopping district with its potential to draw from a regional market attracted by its historic ambiance. On H Street, there are tensions as long-time businesses feel the pressure of changing consumer tastes and expectations. At Potomac Avenue, a new upscale grocery store will provide a needed retail anchor but also has raised fears of gentrification. On the other hand, some of the Hill’s commercial districts, such as Benning Road, have yet to see significant reinvestment. [Photo Caption: Compared to neighborhoods in Northwest Washington, Capitol Hill is underserved by retail stores and services.] (e) While the upgrading of retail services in established commercial districts is a positive sign, there continue to be fears about the encroachment of non-residential uses into row house neighborhoods. This has historically been an issue around the U.S. Capitol, where many small row houses have been converted to offices, national associations, and non-profits. More recently, other issues related to the federal presence have emerged—such as street closures and new security measures around government buildings. Commercial encroachment has also become a concern along 2nd and 3rd Streets northeast of Union Station f) A different but related issue has emerged along 11th Street and 15th Streets. In the early 20th century, these streets were active neighborhood commercial districts, with many small shops and businesses. These districts are now primarily residential in character, with only a few small businesses and corner stores remaining. There is some interest among the Advisory Neighborhood Commissions and residents in rezoning these areas from commercial to residential use. This would provide assurance that future development is compatible with surrounding uses, but it could also create non-conforming commercial uses. As the future of these commercial areas is considered, however, attention should also be given to preserving the small businesses and corner stores that now serve the community g) Capitol Hill’s parks and open spaces contribute to neighborhood stability and are an important amenity. But there are too few parks to meet neighborhood needs. Some of the community’s most important open spaces, like Lincoln Park and Stanton Park, were designed to be ornamental squares rather AREA ELEM ENTS COM PREHENSIVE PLAN D ISTRICT ELEM ENTS ADOPTED 12/19/06 P. 2-9 than active recreational areas. Many of the parks are small triangles with no room for recreational facilities. The new recreation center at Sherwood has been a much-needed improvement but primarily serves the northwest part of the Hill. Similar improvements are needed elsewhere. The community needs to be better connected to the Anacostia River, with its vast open spaces and waterfront amenities. As Reservation 13 is redeveloped and as the future of the RFK Stadium complex is debated, opportunities for new large parks serving Capitol Hill should be recognized. The community must be provided with a high level of access to the planned network of shoreline parks and trails, and to existing and planned boating facilities. 347 [PULLQUOTE: Capitol Hill’s parks and open spaces contribute to neighborhood stability and are an important amenity. But there are too few parks to meet neighborhood needs. Some of the community’s most important open spaces, like Lincoln Park and Stanton Park, were designed to be ornamental squares rather than active recreational areas.] (h) As a historic community, Capitol Hill faces unique urban design issues. These issues relate to the design of new buildings and infill development, the alteration of existing structures, and the treatment of public spaces like Metro plazas and streets. As noted in the Historic Preservation Element of the Comprehensive Plan, contemporary architecture can fit within the fabric of an historic community, but issues relating to scale, texture, materials, and context must be reconciled. Historic places like Eastern Market, the Sewell-Belmont House, and Friendship House should be protected from nearby development that would reduce their architectural and design integrity. Elsewhere, greater steps may be needed to avoid “demolition by neglect” and to ensure that historic preservation regulations are enforced to the greatest extent possible. The public realm also needs improvement, particularly along H Street, Benning Road, and Pennsylvania Avenue. Detailed guidelines may needed to ensure that lighting, building materials, street furniture, signage, sidewalk materials, street trees, landscaping, trash containers, and other aspects of the streetscape are appropriately designed i) Issues of housing affordability and displacement are present in Capitol Hill, as they are in many other parts of the District of Columbia. The pressures are particularly significant in the Near Northeast area (between H Street and Florida Avenue where home prices tripled between 2000 and 2005. In some respects, Capitol Hill may be better equipped to handle rising housing costs than other parts of the city— the prevalence of row houses with rentable basements creates affordable housing options for renters and extra income for owners. Nonetheless, some longtime homeowners have “cashed out” while some renters have moved elsewhere in search of more affordable housing. The 208-unit Potomac Gardens public housing project has been identified as a possible “new community” site, raising further fears of displacement and the loss of one of the few remaining affordable housing developments in the area. If the site is redeveloped, one-for-one replacement of the public housing units will be an important prerequisite j) Parking remains an issue on Capitol Hill, especially on the western edge of the area near the US Capitol and in the Eastern Market/ Barracks Row area. The reopening of RFK Stadium has created parking problems on nearby residential streets in Hill East, and the prospect of a revitalized H Street and emerging NOMA business district may bring future parking problems to nearby residential side streets. These problems are complicated by the fact that many of the homes and apartments on Capitol Hill do not have dedicated off-street parking spaces. Curb cuts serving new development have further reduced the supply of on-street spaces. Residential permit parking has achieved some success in the area, but there are issues related to enforcement and abuse of parking privileges. [PULLQUOTE: Parking remains an issue on Capitol Hill, especially on the western edge of the area near the US Capitol and in the Eastern Market/ Barracks Row area.

Its neighborhoods are also vulnerable to overflow traffic when the freeways are congested. Residential north-south streets are often clogged with “cut- through” traffic as commuters weave between the east-west arterials. This creates noise, air pollution, and safety issues for residents. One-way streets have been established to facilitate traffic flow but the streets are not always paired, leading to circuitous travel and high volumes of fast-moving commuter traffic. Street and lane closures, illegal parking, and poorly timed signals contribute to congestion problems. At one time, a freeway link was proposed between I-295 and I-395 via Barney Circle, but this project was cancelled in the 1990s. A more recent proposal calls for removal of a portion of the Southeast/Southwest Freeway, its replacement with an at-grade roadway between Barney Circle and 8th Street, and a tunnel in lieu of the elevated freeway between 8th Street and South Capitol Street. While this would remove a barrier between Capitol Hill and the waterfront, there are many questions yet to be answered about the effects on traffic and adjacent land uses. Policies and Actions CH-1.0 General Policies CH-1.1 Guiding Growth and Neighborhood Conservation 1608 The following general policies and actions should guide growth and neighborhood conservation decisions on Capitol Hill. These policies and actions should be considered in tandem with those in the citywide elements of the Comprehensive Plan. The Lower Anacostia Waterfront/ Near Southeast Element should be consulted for policies relating to the future of the adjoining Southeast Waterfront Area. 1608.1 Policy CH-1.1.1: Conserving Residential Uses Maintain the integrity and quality of Capitol Hill’s residential uses, and recognize the importance of its historic architecture and housing stock to the entire District of Columbia. Ensure that Comprehensive Plan and zoning designations for Capitol Hill neighborhoods sustain its moderate density land use pattern. 1608.2 Policy CH-1.1.2: Renovation of Housing Stock Encourage the rehabilitation and renovation of the building stock throughout the Capitol Hill Planning Area, taking steps to preserve and restore important historic features. Where infill development occurs, its scale and character should be compatible with prevailing neighborhood densities and its design should contribute to neighborhood continuity and quality. 1608.3 Policy CH-1.1.3: Upgrading Commercial Districts Reinforce and upgrade the major commercial districts of Capitol Hill, including the H Street and Benning Road corridors, the Pennsylvania Avenue corridor, 7th and 8th Streets SE, and Massachusetts Avenue between Union Station and Stanton Park. Support the further development of these areas with 349 localserving retail services, provided that such uses are compatible with surrounding land uses and the historic architecture and scale of the shopping districts themselves. Support the retention of existing neighborhood-serving businesses in these areas through programs that which provide technical and financial assistance to small, locally-owned establishments. 1608.4 AREA ELEM ENTS COMPREHENSIVE PLAN DISTRICT ELEMENTS ADOPTED 12/19/06 P. 2-11 [Photo Caption: Row homes near Barney Circle] Policy CH-1.1.4: Directing Growth Direct growth in the Capitol Hill Planning Area to commercially zoned land, with a particular emphasis on the H Street/ Benning Road corridor. Mixed use development combining ground floor retail and upper story residential uses should be supported in this area, along with streetscape improvements that improve visual and urban design qualities and enhance pedestrian, bus, and auto circulation. As in all parts of the city, the scale of development must be sensitive to adjacent uses and should reflect the capacity of roads, infrastructure, and services to absorb additional growth. 1608.5 Policy CH-1.1.5: NoMA/ Capitol Hill Transition Areas Improve buffering and urban design transitions between the emerging office and high -density residential corridor north of Union Station (“NoMA”) and the adjacent row house neighborhoods of Capitol Hill. Use zoning, design guidelines, historic preservation review, and other measures to avoid sharp contrasts in scale and character where high density and moderate density areas abut one another. 1608.6 See the Urban Design Element for additional policies on scale transitions where high density Downtown uses abut row house neighborhoods. See the Central Washington Element for policies and actions on the NoMA neighborhood. Policy CH-1.1.6: Inappropriate Commercial Uses Prevent the proliferation of fast food outlets, self-service gas stations, convenience mini-marts, and other “drive-through” businesses along Capitol Hill’s commercial corridors, recognizing that these streets are part of the historic L’Enfant Plan and shape the city’s identity and national image. 1608.7 Policy CH-1.1.7: Alleys Protect Capitol Hill’s system of historic alleys and develop plans for the use of large block interior spaces where appropriate. These plans should be developed in coordination with the affected Advisory Neighborhood Commissions, residents, and community groups. 1608.8 Policy CH-1.1.8: Encroachment of Non-Residential Uses Strictly limit the conversion of housing to non-residential uses and the replacement of housing with nonresidential uses in the Capitol Hill Planning Area. This includes the development of private clubs, apartment houses, rooming houses, single room occupancy homes, museums, colleges, universities, and dormitories within the Capitol Hill Historic District. 1608.9 See also Land Use Element Action LU-3.2-B to amend the R-4 Row House Zoning District so that museums, dormitories, colleges, etc. are not permitted as “matter of right” uses. [Photo Caption: H Street NE] Policy CH-1.1.9: Conversion of Non-Residential Structures Allow the conversion of obsolete or vacant non-residential structures (including schools, churches, warehouses, and institutional uses) to housing, provided that important architectural resources are conserved and the resulting development is consistent in density with surrounding uses. 1608.10 350 Policy CH-1.1.10: Public Housing Rehabilitate public housing projects on Capitol Hill, ensuring that any units that are removed are replaced in-kind by new public housing units within the community. Where feasible, rehabilitation projects should provide home ownership opportunities for public housing residents. 1608.11 AREA ELEM ENTS COMPREHENSIVE PLAN DISTRICT ELEMENTS ADOPTED 12/19/06 P. 2-12 Policy CH-1.1.11: 15th Street Commercial District Discourage the further expansion of commercial uses along 15th Street SE. This corridor should gradually transition to predominantly residential uses, compatible in density with adjacent row house blocks. As this transition occurs, efforts should be made to retain the existing corner stores and small businesses which serve the community. 1608.12 Policy CH-1.1.12: RFK Stadium Area Provide improved buffering and landscaping screening along 19th Street and elsewhere in the vicinity of RFK Stadium in order to reduce the effects of noise, dust, vibration, and air pollution on the adjacent Hill East community. Work collaboratively with the National Park Service and National Capital Planning Commission on long-range plans for the stadium and adjacent parkland and parking lots. Waterfront open space in this area should be retained and improved for the benefit of Hill East, Kingman Park, and Rosedale residents. 1608.13 [Photo Caption: Eastern Market] Policy CH-1.1.13: Traffic Management Strategies Establish traffic management strategies to reduce commuter traffic on East Capitol Street, Independence Avenue, C Street NE, 17th Street SE, and other predominantly residential streets that also function as through-streets. These strategies should include limiting additional one-way streets on Capitol Hill (and possibly restoring existing one-way streets to two-way traffic improving signal timing on Benning Road and Pennsylvania Avenue, and improving pedestrian and bicycle safety. Measures should also be implemented to route through-traffic around residential neighborhoods, and to restrict trucks and heavy vehicles on local streets. 1608.14 Policy CH-1.1.14: Southeast/ Southwest Freeway Mitigate the effects of the Southeast/ Southwest Freeway; including noise, emissions, dust, and visual blight on adjacent Capitol Hill neighborhoods. Continue to evaluate the transportation and land use impacts associated with the freeway’s proposed replacement with an at-grade boulevard and tunnel. 1608.15 Policy CH-1.1.15: Transit Service Maintain and improve mass transit service in the Near Northeast section of the neighborhood, particularly along the corridor extending from Union Station along H Street to Hechinger Mall and continuing on Benning Road to the Minnesota Avenue Metro station. 1608.16 Action CH-1.1-A: Façade Improvements Support urban design and façade improvements along H Street, Benning Road, Pennsylvania Avenue, and Barracks Row. Such improvements should preserve and enhance the historic features, scale, and texture of existing structures. 1608.17 Action CH-1.1-B: 15th Street Rezoning Rezone the 15th Street commercial district for residential uses, consistent with the corridor’s designation on the Comprehensive Plan. 1608.18 Action CH-1.1-C: Transportation Studies 351 Complete DDOT’s Capitol Hill Transportation Study and implement its major recommendations. Also, implement the Middle Anacostia and H Street transportation study recommendations, aimed at reducing through-traffic on neighborhood streets within Capitol Hill, limiting truck traffic, and improving conditions for Capitol Hill pedestrians, bicyclists, and transit users. 1608.19 AREA ELEM ENTS COMPREHENSIVE PLAN DISTRICT ELEMENTS ADOPTED 12/19/06 P. 2-13 Action CH-1.1-D: H Street Streetcar Implement proposed streetscape improvements for the H Street/ Benning Road corridor, including the development of a streetcar line between the Minnesota Avenue Metro station and Union Station. 1608.20 Action CH-1.1-E: Eastern Market Shuttle Provide shuttle bus service from the Eastern Market Metrorail station to the future Washington Nationals ballpark site on South Capitol Street, including stops along 8th Street SE to further promote businesses along Barracks Row. 1608.21 [Photo caption: Homes along East Capitol Street] CH-1.2 Conserving and Enhancing Community Resources 1609 Policy CH-1.2.1: Recognition of Historic Resources Protect and preserve historic structures, places, and landmarks on Capitol Hill, including Congressional Cemetery. Seek greater recognition of the neighborhood’s defining physical features—including the L’Enfant street plan—as important and nationally-significant cultural resources. 1609.1 Policy CH-1.2.2: Implementation of Preservation Programs Solicit additional community input on historic preservation needs and opportunities in the Capitol Hill Planning Area, including the surveying of additional areas, expansion of existing historic districts, and increasing the number of landmarked buildings in the city's current inventory. The HPO should concentrate its efforts in the areas north and east of the Capitol Hill Historic District, and should seek to protect structures along H Street and in other areas that are not currently protected under the District's preservation law. Historic district laws and guidelines should be strictly monitored and enforced for all new construction, alterations, and public space uses. 1609..2 Policy CH-1.2.3: L’Enfant Avenues Protect and preserve the special character, scale, and historic features of the major L’Enfant Plan avenues that cross Capitol Hill, especially Massachusetts Avenue, Pennsylvania Avenue, and East Capitol Street. 1609.3 Policy CH-1.2.4: Community Facilities Promote continued investment, maintenance, and modernization of important community public facilities in the Capitol Hill Planning Area, including schools, libraries, and social service facilities. Particular attention should be given to sustaining Eastern High School as a community anchor, and to maintaining Friendship House and the local Boys and Girls Club as social service organizations. 1609.4 Policy CH-1.2.5: Riverfront Parks Ensure that the proposed Anacostia waterfront parks are designed and planned to benefit Capitol Hill residents, with efforts taken to create safe pedestrian, bicycle, and transit connections to the shoreline and to provide park facilities and services that respond to the needs of Hill East neighborhoods. 1609.5 [PULLQUOTE: Ensure that the proposed Anacostia waterfront parks are designed and planned to 352 benefit Capitol Hill residents, with efforts taken to create safe pedestrian, bicycle, and transit connections to the shoreline and to provide park facilities and services that respond to the needs of Hill East neighborhoods.] Policy CH-1.2.6: Improved Park and Recreation Services Improve parks, playgrounds, and recreational facilities throughout Capitol Hill, with a priority on the Near Northeast neighborhood (between H Street and Florida Avenue The 2006 Parks Master Plan AREA ELEM ENTS COMPREHENSIVE PLAN DISTRICT ELEMENTS ADOPTED 12/19/06 P. 2-14 determined that this area was particularly deficient in recreational facilities. Continue efforts to improve safety, security, and maintenance levels at all parks in the Capitol Hill Planning Area. 1609.6 Policy CH-1.2.7: National Park Service Coordination Recognize that most of the parkland in and around the Capitol Hill Planning Area is owned and operated by the National Park Service (NPS and consequently that a high level of coordination is required between the District and federal governments to ensure that this land is managed in the best interest of Capitol Hill residents. NPS parks include Lincoln Park, Stanton Park, Folger Park, Garfield Park, Seward Square, Marion Park, and the Virginia Avenue playground, as well as the RFK stadium area. These spaces should be conserved and improved as aesthetic, recreational, and natural resources. 1609.7 Policy CH-1.2.8: Streets as Open Space Maintain and enhance “functional” open space within Capitol Hill, particularly the landscaped areas contained within street rights-of-way. These areas include the Pennsylvania Avenue esplanade, the numerous triangle parks along diagonal streets, public plazas such as the area around Eastern Market Metrorail, and the front “yards” of most Capitol Hill row houses, portions of which are located within the public right-of-way. 1609.8 Action CH-1.2-A: Historic Surveys Conduct historic surveys for the portion of Stanton Park not currently in the Capitol Hill Historic District, and for the Near Northeast, Hill East, Rosedale, and Kingman Park neighborhoods. Based on the findings of those surveys and additional community input and recommendations, prepare nominations to the National Register as appropriate. Consideration should be given to extending the Capitol Hill Historic District eastward to the boundary of the 1791 L’Enfant Plan. 1609.9 Action CH-1.2-B: Capitol Hill Design Guidelines Develop graphic design guidelines for the Capitol Hill Historic District, illustrating appropriate architectural design features for new construction, renovation, and alterations. 1609.10 Action CH-1.2-C: RFK Stadium Area Actively participate in the current effort by the National Capitol Planning Commission, the National Park Service, the Anacostia Waterfront Corporation, local Advisory Neighborhood Commissioners, residents, and neighborhood groups to develop a long-range plan for the RFK Stadium complex, extending from the DC Armory north to Benning Road.

AREA ELEM ENTS COMPREHENSIVE PLAN DISTRICT ELEMENTS ADOPTED 12/19/06 P. 2-16 The area declined during the 1950s and 1960s and was heavily damaged by the riots of 1968. An Urban Renewal Plan sparked some reinvestment on the corridor in the 1970s and 1980s, including the Hechinger Mall development on the eastern end, but the strip has yet to fully recover. H Street’s retail space has not kept up with the rapidly expanding buying power of the surrounding neighborhoods, or the burgeoning 354 office market north and east of Union Station. 1611.1 In 2003, the Office of Planning completed a Small Area Plan for the H Street corridor, designed to guide community, private sector, and public agency action and investments. The Plan lays out a vision for H Street as a great neighborhood shopping street, serving resident needs, providing connections to the larger city, and improving the livability of the surrounding community. The Plan segmented the corridor into four parts, each with a unique identity and character (see Policy CH-2.1.1 below The potential for over 750 units of new housing, 200,000 square feet of new office space, and 300,000 square feet of retail space was identified. However, these projections may have been low; just two years after the Plan’s completion, there were already 450 units of housing under construction on the 200 block of H Street (the former Children’s Museum site and another 300 units proposed across the street. 1611.2 Land use recommendations in the H Street Plan were accompanied by transportation recommendations, some of which are already being implemented. A transitway will be developed along the corridor, with streetcars sharing the right-of-way with vehicles. The streetcar line will connect Union Station to Minnesota Avenue, providing a “loop” between Metro’s Red Line and Orange Line and increasing transit access for Northeast Capitol Hill residents. The 2003 Plan also recommended the retention of on- street parking and development of new off-street parking structures. 1611.3 Extensive streetscape, signage, and façade improvements also are planned, including new pedestrian crossings and a civic plaza at the eastern gateway near Hechinger Mall. The H Street Plan also calls for increased code enforcement, the use of preservation tax credits, new incentive and assistance programs, and the creation of a Business Improvement District (or incorporation of H Street into the Capitol Hill BID 1611.4 East of H Street, the Benning Road (between 15th Street and Oklahoma Avenue) corridor includes a mix of residential uses and auto-oriented commercial uses. The character of the street changes considerably, with higher traffic volumes, a wider right-of-way, and a much less pedestrian-oriented atmosphere. The proposed construction of the H Street-Benning streetcar, along with accompanying “Great Street” improvements such as new street trees and lighting, will create opportunities for revitalization and new businesses along Benning Road. This will provide a needed amenity for the adjoining Rosedale and Kingman Park neighborhoods, which currently lack convenient retail services. 1611.5 See the Anacostia Waterfront Element for discussion of the Benning Road Transportation Study, Kingman Island and the RFK Stadium area. Policy CH-2.1.1: H Street Revitalization Support the revitalization of the H Street corridor between North Capitol Street and 17th Street NE in a manner that is consistent with the approved 2003 H Street Strategic Development Plan. This Plan recommended the development of four thematic areas along the H Street corridor: 1611.6 (a) Western Gateway, between North Capitol Street and 7th Street NE. This area includes air rights development over the CSX railroad (Burnham Place) and an “urban living” district between 2nd Street and 7th Street NE. The Urban living district is intended for medium to high density residential development, with limited ground floor retail uses. 355 (b) Central Retail, extending from 7th Street to 12th Street NE. This area is envisioned as the “downtown” of the H Street community. Existing retail space is to be revitalized, and new mixed use AREA ELEM ENTS COMPREHENSIVE PLAN DISTRICT ELEMENTS ADOPTED 12/19/06 P. 2-17 projects combining ground floor retail and upper story housing are encouraged. Parking is to be enhanced by removing on-street parking restrictions and identifying opportunities for structured off-street parking c) An Arts and Entertainment District, extending from 12th Street to 15th Street. This area builds on the established Atlas Theater, H Street Playhouse, and RL Christian Library. New arts and cultural uses are encouraged, as are complementary specialty retail uses, sit-down restaurants, arts-related retail, and other community services. Moderate-density residential and office space, including live-work space, also is encouraged in this area d) Hechinger Mall (in the adjacent Upper Northeast Planning Area Continued improvements to the Hechinger Mall are planned to make the area more pedestrian-friendly, construct a civic plaza, and add infill development (including housing) on the mall parking lots. [Photo Caption: H Street NE] Policy CH-2.1.2: Clustering of Retail Recognize that the existing supply of retail space on the H Street NE corridor may exceed demand, and that retail development should therefore be clustered on the 700-1100 blocks. 1611.7 Policy CH-2.1.3: Physical Improvements Improve the infrastructure and physical appearance of the H Street corridor as a way to enhance its market perception, and to attract investors, visitors, shoppers, and residents. 1611.8 Policy CH-2.1.4: H Street Transit and Streetscape Improvements Undertake transit and streetscape improvements to enhance mobility along H Street, and improve the area’s accessibility from the surrounding neighborhoods and other parts of the city. Improvements should upgrade aesthetics and pedestrian safety and make walking along the street more comfortable and enjoyable. 1611.9 Policy CH-2.1.5: Parking Retain existing on-street parking along H Street. As recommended by the H Street Small Area Plan adopted by Council, encourage the development of structured off-street and shared parking lots serving the retail and theater areas on the central and eastern parts of the commercial district. 1611.10 Policy CH-2.1.6: Historic Preservation Encourage the preservation of historic buildings along H Street, and promote educational and cultural tourism activities to raise awareness of the corridor’s history and unique historic character. Consistent with the H Street Small Area Plan, this should expanded surveys, tax credits, and a determination of the H Street corridor’s eligibility for designation as a National Historic District. 1611.11 Policy CH-2.1.7: H Street Overpass Ensure that any future development in the air rights adjacent to the H Street overpass recognizes the limitations of the streets beneath the bridge to serve high volume commercial traffic, and includes provisions for parking and delivery ingress and egress from the bridge itself. The allowable height of any building constructed in the air rights should be measured from the existing grade of 1st Street or 2nd Street NE, rather than from the overpass. 1611.12 Action CH-2.1-A: H Street Strategic Development Plan Implement the recommendations of the 2003 H Street Strategic Development Plan. 1611.13 Action CH-2.1-B: Great Streets Improvements Implement “Great Streets” streetscape plans for H Street and Benning Road, including landscaping the 356 avenue from Union Station to the Anacostia River, maintaining the width of the street, planting trees, AREA ELEM ENTS COMPREHENSIVE PLAN DISTRICT ELEMENTS ADOPTED 12/19/06 P. 2-18 upgrading signage and street furniture, and taking other steps to manage traffic flow and reduce cutthrough traffic in adjacent neighborhoods. Many of these recommendations may be found in the 2004 DDOT H Street NE Corridor Transportation Study. Additional improvements should include provisions for a mid-block traffic signal and crosswalk on the 600 block of H Street NE to ensure pedestrian safety and to allow safe ingress and egress to development planned in this area. 1611.14 Action CH-2.1-C: Library Replacement Pursue replacement of the RL Christian Library with a modern state-of-the-art library facility at 13th and H Streets. 1611.15 [Photo Caption: RL Christian Library] Action CH-2.1-D: Business Assistance Implement programs to improve retail success along H Street, including financial assistance to small businesses, grant and loan programs, façade improvement programs, Small Business Administration loans, and the creation of a Business Improvement District. 1611.16 Action CH-2.1-E: Marketing and Branding Continue collaborative efforts with merchants, property owners, and residents to improve “branding” and marketing of the H Street corridor and highlight the street’s direction as a center of neighborhood life in Northeast Capitol Hill. 1611.17 See also Action CH-1.1-D on the H Street-Benning Road streetcar CH-2.2: Pennsylvania Avenue SE Corridor 1612 Pennsylvania Avenue is sometimes referred to as “America’s Main Street” and has ceremonial, historic, and symbolic importance. In many respects, the avenue is also Capitol Hill’s Main Street, with walkable shopping areas extending up 7th Street to Eastern Market, and down 7th and 8th Streets through the Barracks Row historic area. This concentration of commercial uses is known as Capitol Hill’s “Central Business District.” 1612.1 East of 9th Street SE, Pennsylvania Avenue becomes more residential in character, although there are commercial uses at many of the intersections. Some of these commercial uses are auto-oriented (gas stations and fast food outlets and serve the heavy volume of commuter traffic headed to or from the Sousa Bridge. The juxtaposition of older residential row homes and drive-through commercial uses creates land use conflicts on the corridor, and compromises the image of Pennsylvania Avenue as a gateway to the nation’s capital. Consequently, the entire corridor from the US Capitol east to the Maryland line was designated by the city as a “Great Street” in 2005. Efforts are underway to improve the streetscape, and address a variety of land use, transportation, and design issues. 1612.2 Two metrorail subway stations along the corridor present both challenges and opportunities. The Eastern Market station entrance is an unwelcoming public space located in an otherwise attractive pedestrianfriendly area. The possibility of developing the plaza as a “town square” has been explored in the past and should continue to be pursued. Historic Eastern Market itself is in need of structural improvements, and there continue to be issues related to the lack of parking in the vicinity. 1612.3 [Photo Caption: Pennsylvania Avenue SE-alternate photo to be used] The Potomac Avenue Metro station area suffers from a lack of identity, poor visibility, and conditions that are dangerous for pedestrians.

The community remains concerned about the scale of proposed development around the station, given that the area is currently characterized by two and three story row houses. Opportunities for new multi-family development should be concentrated on vacant lots and on the “drive-through” commercial properties along the avenue, and should emphasize moderate densities rather than medium or high densities. Refurbishing and renovation of older commercial buildings, particularly those with pedestrian-oriented retail storefronts, should also be strongly encouraged. Efforts to create a “Main Street” program in this area were initiated several years ago and should be supported in the future. 1612.4 [PULLQUOTE: The Potomac Avenue Metro station area suffers from a lack of identity, poor visibility, and conditions that are dangerous for pedestrians.

The design of the avenue, including adjacent buildings, land uses, and public spaces should adhere to high aesthetic standards and should enhance the avenue’s role as a neighborhood commercial center and walkable street. 1612.5 Policy CH-2.2.2: Neighborhood Shopping Improvements Sustain existing businesses and encourage additional neighborhood serving retail uses along Barracks Row, on 7th Street SE between Pennsylvania Avenue and North Carolina Avenue, and along Pennsylvania Avenue between 2nd Street and 4th Street SE, 6th and 9th Streets SE, and 12th and 16th Streets SE. Any improvements or alterations in these areas should protect and preserve the historic texture, scale, and features of the existing buildings and adjoining neighborhoods. 1612.6 Policy CH-2.2.3: Eastern Market Metrorail Station Improve the urban design quality of the Eastern Market Metrorail station area. Consider development of moderate density housing with ground floor retail on underused commercial sites in the station vicinity. Provide appropriate transitions between such development and adjacent residential areas, and take steps to manage additional traffic and parking demand and improve Metro access. 1612.7 Policy CH-2.2.4: Eastern Market Continue to promote Eastern Market’s intended function as a produce, meat, farmers, and retail market as well as a community meeting place and visual arts center. Preserve the historic character of the Market and surrounding area. 1612.8 Policy CH-2.2.5: Barracks Row Continue to promote Barracks Row as a neighborhood-serving retail center. Emphasize local-serving rather than regional or large-format retail uses, and retain the area’s historic scale and character. Particularly encourage additional retail to locate along the portion of Barracks Row located south of the freeway, thus enhancing the connection between Capitol Hill and the emerging waterfront neighborhoods. 1612.9 [Photo Caption: Barracks Row] Policy CH-2.2.6: Potomac Avenue Metrorail Station Support the revitalization of vacant commercial space and additional moderate density mixed use development around the Potomac Avenue Metro station. Such development should be located on existing 358 commercially zoned property and developed in a manner that is consistent with existing zoning (including established provisions for planned unit developments and pending programs for inclusionary housing AREA ELEM ENTS COMPREHENSIVE PLAN DISTRICT ELEMENTS ADOPTED 12/19/06 P. 2-20 Any infill development should be relatively low-scale, respecting the character of the adjacent row house community. 1612.10 Action CH-2.2-A: Streetscape Improvements Implement “Great Streets” plans to beautify Pennsylvania Avenue, including landscaping, street furniture and street lighting improvements, maintenance of the esplanade and small parks along the avenue, pedestrian improvements, and traffic management measures. These improvements should reinforce the avenue’s role as a historic street and ceremonial gateway and should complement the efforts that have already been made to improve the streetscape in the 600 block and near Eastern Market. 1612.11 Action CH-2.2-B: Eastern Market Plaza Prepare and implement an urban design and transit improvement plan for the Eastern Market Metro station entrance, making it a more attractive “town square” and improving the plaza’s ability to function as a major transfer point between Metrorail’s Blue Line and connecting buses serving Southeast Washington. 1612.12 Action CH-2.2-C: Eastern Market Renovation Implement plans to improve Eastern Market, addressing structural deficiencies and renovation needs, as well as related issues such as parking, access, and deliveries. 1612.13 Action CH-2.2-D: Potomac Gardens New Community Pursue redevelopment of Potomac Gardens as a new community, replacing the existing public housing development with new mixed income housing, including an equivalent number of affordable units and additional market rate units. Overall densities on the site should be compatible with adjacent uses. Every effort should be made to avoid the long-term displacement of existing residents if the project is reconstructed. 1612.14 See the Economic Development Element of the Comprehensive Plan for specific actions relating to the improvement of the city’s “Main Street” retail areas such as Barracks Row. CH-2.3 U.S. Capitol Perimeter 1613 The proximity of Capitol Hill’s residential areas to the U.S. Capitol Complex creates a variety of land use, transportation, and urban design issues. Expansion of the Capitol Complex during the 1900s resulted in the development of large office buildings and expanded federal facilities on former row house blocks. This prompted some of the Hill’s earliest historic preservation initiatives, along with the adoption of a Capitol Interest Overlay Zone that established maximum height and floor area ratio limits in an area extending from the edge of the Capitol Complex east to 6th Street. Currently, the Capitol Interest Overlay zone encompasses a variety of existing land uses, including homes and apartments, hotels, nonprofits, offices, restaurants, retail stores, and parks. Long-range plans for the Capitol Complex are articulated in a Master Plan that is prepared and periodically updated by the Architect of the Capitol. 1613.1 [PULLQUOTE: Expansion of the Capitol Complex during the 1900s resulted in the development of large 359 office buildings and expanded federal facilities on former row house blocks.

Any land transferred from the Architect of the Capitol to the District or a private party should likewise be used in a manner that is consistent with the Capitol Master Plan and the Comprehensive Plan. 1613.3 Policy CH-2.3.2: Capitol Area Traffic and Parking Work with the Architect of the Capitol to reduce parking and traffic impacts in areas adjacent to the U.S. Capitol and to address related problems such as tour bus parking and the enforcement of residential permit parking restrictions. 1613.4 Policy CH-2.3.3: Surface Transportation Improvements Improve surface transportation in and around the Capitol Complex in a manner that reduces impacts on Capitol Hill neighborhoods and facilitates access within the area. This could include the use of shuttles between key destinations such as Union Station, the new Capitol Visitors Center, and the Capitol South Metro station. 1613.5 Policy CH-2.3.4: Impacts of Security Measures Encourage the Architect of the Capitol to coordinate all proposed street closings, re-routings, and security measures with District government. 1613.6 See the Urban Design Element for additional policies on security and urban design. Please consult the Transportation Element for policies on street closures. Policy CH-2.3.5: Compatibility of Federal Facilities Work with the Architect of the Capitol to ensure that the development of future federal buildings is compatible with and protects the moderate density residential character of adjacent residential areas. This includes the development of ancillary federal facilities such as child care centers, housing and classroom space for Congressional interns, police facilities, Congressionally-sponsored service institutions, and public works maintenance and storage areas used by the Architect of the Capitol 1613.7 Policy CH-2.3.6: Capitol Power Plant Ensure that the Capitol Power Plant and Refrigeration Plant are operated in ways that reduce air pollution, noise, and other impacts.

Reservation 13 has AREA ELEM ENTS COMPREHENSIVE PLAN DISTRICT ELEMENTS ADOPTED 12/19/06 P. 2-22 contained public health facilities since 1846, when it became the location of the Washington Asylum— the city’s hospital for indigent patients. In later years, it housed a smallpox hospital, quarantine station, and crematory. Some of the site’s early buildings, such as Anne Archbold Hall, remain today. However, most of the buildings on the site were constructed in the 1930s and 1940s. The site became DC General Hospital in 1953. The DC Jail was built in 1976, replacing the old jail on the site that dated back to the 1870s. 1515.1 Reservation 13 presents itself today as a vast area of large, seemingly unrelated buildings associated only by their proximity and former use. Vast areas of the site are used for parking, and there are few areas where the natural beauty of the waterside setting can be appreciated. The site is not at all related to the low-scale row house neighborhood west of 19th Street, nor is it related to the nearby Metrorail station at Stadium-Armory. While the Departments of Health and Mental Health, the Medical Examiner, and the Court Supervisor and Offender Supervision Agency all utilize space on the site, many of the buildings are underutilized. DC General Hospital itself was closed in 2001. 1515.2 [PULLQUOTE: Reservation 13 presents itself today as a vast area of large, seemingly unrelated buildings associated only by their proximity and former use. Vast areas of the site are used for parking, and there are few areas where the natural beauty of the waterside setting can be appreciated.] A Master Plan for Reservation 13 was completed in 2002 and later adopted by the City Council. It seeks to retain important civic uses, connect residential areas to the shoreline, and redevelop the site as an extension of the adjacent Hill East neighborhood. Since completion of the Plan, transfer of the site from federal to local ownership along with “pre-zoning” to reflect the uses envisioned by the Master Plan have both been initiated. As of early 2006, neither of these actions has been completed. 1515.3 The adopted Reservation 13 Master Plan retains the DC Jail and other institutional uses and identifies approximately 40 acres for redevelopment. New facilities for health care and recreation are envisioned, along with new housing, offices, retail, and institutional uses. Key urban design features include extension of the Capitol Hill street grid into the site, new parks, and new access to the waterfront, including a great meadow overlooking the shoreline. Other notable elements of the plan include the extension of Massachusetts Avenue to the Anacostia River and a village square at the Stadium- Armory Metrorail station. The preliminary development program identifies the potential for 800 new housing units and over 3 million square feet of non-residential space, roughly doubling the total square footage of buildings on the site. 1515.4 361 Immediately north of Reservation 13 lies the RFK Stadium complex. RFK Stadium was built in 1961 at a particularly prominent location along the east-west axis that includes the U.S. Capitol, Washington Monument, and Lincoln Memorial. More than 100 acres of land around the stadium is used for surface parking and unimproved open space. The area is owned by the federal government and is currently under study by the National Capital Planning Commission. It was identified in the 1997 NCPC Legacy Plan as a possible location for major new memorials, recreation, and open space as well as possible private development. 1515.5 Policy CH-2.4.1: Redevelopment of Public Reservation 13 Redevelop Reservation 13 as a mixed use neighborhood that combines housing, office space, health care, civic, education, and recreational uses. Established uses such as the DC Correctional Facility should be retained. Health care and institutional uses on the site should be reorganized to accommodate infill uses, improve the site’s vitality and efficiency, and create an environment more conducive to pedestrian travel. 1515.6 AREA ELEM ENTS COMPREHENSIVE PLAN DISTRICT ELEMENTS ADOPTED 12/19/06 P. 2-23 Policy CH-2.4.2: Reservation 13 as an Extension of Hill East Connect the established Hill East neighborhood to the Anacostia waterfront by extending Massachusetts Avenue and the Capitol Hill street grid through Reservation 13 to new shoreline parks and open spaces. Massachusetts Avenue should be designed as a grand boulevard in the tradition of the L’Enfant Plan, and should terminate in a dramatic overlook above the Anacostia River. 1515.7 Policy CH-2.4.3: Reservation 13 Parkland Create new waterfront parklands and green spaces at Reservation 13, including a grand waterfront park, recreational trails along the waterfront, smaller neighborhood parks and open spaces within the site, and tree-lined pedestrian streets. 1515.8 Policy CH-2.4.4: Stadium-Armory Station Capitalize on the Stadium-Armory Metrorail station in the design and development of Reservation 13. This should include development of a new neighborhood center near 19th and C Streets SE that serves the unmet needs of the nearby community, as well as the development of moderate to high density housing on the Reservation 13 site. 1515.9 [Photo Caption: Stadium-Armory Metrorail Station] Policy CH-2.4.5: Reservation 13 Building Heights Achieve a gradual progression in building heights on Reservation 13, with the lowest heights along 19th Street SE to buffer the adjacent low-scale row house neighborhoods. Taller buildings should be located along the Massachusetts Avenue extension and on the portions of the site where visual impacts can be minimized by slope and topography.

Its 6.8 square miles include the “monumental core” of the city, with such landmarks as the U.S. Capitol and White House, the Washington Monument and Lincoln Memorial, and the Federal Triangle and Smithsonian Museums. Central Washington also includes the city’s traditional Downtown and other employment centers such as the Near Southwest and East End. It includes Gallery Place and Penn Quarter, the region’s entertainment and cultural center. Finally, Central Washington includes emerging urban neighborhoods like Mount Vernon Triangle and North of Massachusetts Avenue (NoMA 1700.1 The area’s boundaries are shown in the map at left. A majority of the area is within Council Ward 2, with portions also in Ward 6. All of Central Washington is within the boundary of the 1791 L’Enfant Plan and its streets, land uses, and design reflect this legacy. The area’s grand buildings, boulevards, and celebrated open spaces—particularly the monuments, museums, and federal buildings on the National Mall—define Washington’s image as an international capital. Planning for this area is done collaboratively with the federal government, with the National Capital Planning Commission having land use authority over federal lands. 1700.2 Central Washington is of great importance to the District, the region, and the nation. It is the seat of the federal government, and the economic, cultural, and historic core of the region. It contains the third largest concentration of office space in the United States, trailing only New York City and Chicago. The DC Department of Employment Services reports that over 400,000 persons are employed within its boundaries. The area’s preeminence is underscored by its land use patterns; it includes more than 100 million square feet of office space (almost 25 percent of the region’s total 2 million square feet of retail floor space, over 11,000 hotel rooms, major entertainment venues, and the second largest theater district in the country. It is also the center of the region’s transportation network, with one of the best underground mass transit systems in the world. 1700.3 This Area Element takes a broader view of the city center than has been taken in past plans. Historically, city plans for “Downtown” have covered the area east of 16th Street NW, north of the National Mall/ US Capitol complex, and south of Massachusetts Avenue. However, most residents, workers, and 363 visitors think of Downtown in a broader sense—including areas as far north as Dupont Circle, as far west as Foggy Bottom, and as far east as Capitol Hill. Only about half of the central city workforce is located within the city’s “traditional” Downtown. “Traditional” Downtown is also almost completely built out. Most of the District’s future employment growth will take place beyond its boundaries, in areas like NoMA and Near Southeast (in the adjacent Anacostia Watefront Planning Area 1700.4 Washington’s “traditional” Downtown includes Chinatown, the arts district around Gallery Place, the retail core near Metro Center, the mixed use Penn Quarter and Mount Vernon Square areas, and concentrations of government office buildings at Federal Triangle and Judiciary Square. While these areas are distinct from one another, they all offer a blend of historic and contemporary development, a mix of uses, and largely pedestrian-friendly environments. Private office buildings, many built to the 12- to 14-story limit allowed by the Height Act, extend across much of the area. Traditional Downtown also contains many exceptional historic buildings and public spaces, including many National Register Landmarks. 1700.5 AREA ELEM ENTS COMPREHENSIVE PLAN DISTRICT ELEMENTS ADOPTED 12/19/06 P. 2-25 Moving from “traditional” Downtown to the West End, the transition is seamless. The pattern of 12- to 14-story office buildings, hotels, ground floor retail space and restaurants, and historic landmarks continues almost as far as Washington Circle. There are concentrations of retail space along Connecticut Avenue, and a cluster of global financial and banking institutions (including the World Bank and International Monetary Fund) on the area’s western edge. 1700.6 Most of the area just north of the National Mall is federal land. This includes the “Northwest Rectangle” of government and institutional buildings between 17th and 23rd Streets, the Federal Triangle, the White House and Executive Office Building, Old Naval Observatory Hill (site of the proposed US Institute of Peace) and the Corcoran College of Art+Design. Another major concentration of office space lies on the south side of the National Mall in the Near Southwest Federal District. This area includes the headquarters of several federal agencies as well as private office and hotel complexes like L’Enfant Plaza and the Portals. 1700.7 On the eastern and northeastern flank of Downtown, the pattern of intense office development gives way to more varied land uses. The new Washington Convention Center occupies six square blocks north of Mount Vernon Square. A high-density residential area is emerging to the east in the Mount Vernon Triangle on land formerly used for surface parking and small businesses. After 20 years of planning, the Triangle and adjacent Massachusetts Avenue corridor between Mount Vernon Square and Union Station has become one of the densest neighborhoods in the City. Some 1,300 new units were built between 2000 and 2005 and 1,700 units are now under construction. Density on many of these sites is between 200 and 400 units per acre. 1700.8 [Photo Caption: Washington Convention Center] NoMA lies north and east of the Massachusetts Avenue corridor. It includes an emerging office area along North Capitol Street and a light industrial area between the CSX railroad tracks and the row house neighborhoods of Capitol Hill. Office development has moved eastward into NoMA as developable land 364 in the West End, Central Business District, East End, and Capitol Hill has become more scarce. The opening of the New York Avenue Metro station in late 2004 has made the area more attractive for investment, and many residential and office projects are now under consideration in this area. 1700.9 While the office market in Central Washington has remained consistently strong, the area has only recently begun to reverse a decades-long decline in its role as a retail and entertainment destination. Likewise, the 30-year old goal of creating a “living downtown” with high-density housing is finally being realized. Billions of dollars in private investment, coupled with public incentives and plans to attract that investment, have had a transformative impact since the late 1990s. The area has suddenly become “the” place to be in the region, and its first-rate restaurants, boutique hotels, and entertainment venues are attracting national attention. The promise of thousands more new residents, workers, and visitors during the next decade suggests that the best may be yet to come. 1700.10 [PULLQUOTE: The 30-year old goal of creating a “living downtown” with high-density housing is finally being realized.

This landscape was reshaped as work began on the new national capital in the 1790s. Grand municipal buildings rose along the avenues, a canal was constructed (on what later would become Constitution Avenue and homes and businesses were erected along the side streets. During the early 1800s, the government built the White House, the Capitol, City Hall, and other public buildings. 1701.1 Throughout the 19th and early 20th Century, the area extending from the Capitol to the White House and from Pennsylvania Avenue north served as the commercial heart of a growing urban area. In the mid 1860s, the city’s first street car line opened between the Capitol and the Willard Hotel at 14th Street and Pennsylvania Avenue. A streetcar line was later constructed along F Street, NW, which eventually became the city’s primary shopping corridor. 1701.2 As the federal government expanded through the late 19th Century, government buildings and related offices slowly displaced Downtown’s residences and small businesses. By 1891, there were nearly 21,000 federal employees in the central city, and federal bureaus spilled into many buildings originally designed for other commercial functions. Residential growth shifted to new neighborhoods to the north, east, and south. 1701.4 By the end of the 19th century, the National Mall and Smithsonian museums had taken on increased importance as an American gathering place and cultural center. This role was recognized and elevated by the McMillan Commission in 1901. The Commission’s grand plan for the National Mall and its environs reshaped the city for the 20th Century, bringing a unified vision for Central Washington oriented around parks, fine architecture, and “city beautiful” design principles. Central Washington’s physical form was further shaped by the 1899 and 1910 Height Acts, enacted just as other major American cities were discovering the modern skyscraper. 1701.4 365 [Photo Caption: Atlantic Building, Downtown] The area continued to grow for the next 50 years. Two world wars and the New Deal swelled the federal workforce, creating the demand for yet more Downtown office space. Downtown’s retail core thrived as the city’s population grew to more than 800,000 residents by 1950. Conversely, the shrinking number of residential areas in Central Washington began to deteriorate. They were among the first parts of the city targeted for urban renewal in the 1950s. 1701.5 As the metropolitan area decentralized in the 1950s, Downtown’s role became more one- dimensional. Its retail function waned as interstate highways were constructed and the customer base shifted to the suburbs. Office development moved from the traditional Downtown to K Street and to the redevelopment area south of the National Mall. Plans to revitalize Pennsylvania Avenue and other “special streets and places” were developed in response, and a variety of redevelopment concepts were explored for the West End, South Capitol Street, and the near Southeast. 1701.6 These plans did little to stem Downtown’s decline. The center of office activity continued to shift north and west and many of Downtown’s historic landmarks, department stores, and office buildings were demolished or vacated. The 1968 riots also took a toll. 1701.7 AREA ELEM ENTS COMPREHENSIVE PLAN DISTRICT ELEMENTS ADOPTED 12/19/06 P. 2-27 Creation of the Pennsylvania Avenue Development Corporation (PADC) in 1972 set the stage for Downtown’s revival. From 1972 to 1994, the PADC was responsible for bringing the first large scale modern buildings to the traditional Downtown. Despite these efforts, the area still lacked street activity and urban vitality. 1701.8 In 1982, the Mayor’s Downtown Committee with support from the Office of Planning produced “Downtown DC: Recommendations for the Downtown Plan.” The proposed objectives and policies in that document were later placed into legislative format and adopted almost intact as the Downtown Element of the District’s 1984 Comprehensive Plan. The recommendations addressed the area’s decline and called for more diverse uses, with a strong emphasis on housing. The Plan envisioned a city center with retail uses focused on F Street, Gallery Place and Chinatown; new arts uses along 7th Street; and significant residential development at Penn Quarter and Mount Vernon Square. Quantified targets for new housing units, hotel rooms, office space, and arts space were established. 1701.9 Downtown revitalization initiatives continued through the 1980s and 1990s. In the early 1990s, the Zoning Commission created the Downtown Development District (DDD) which required a greater mix of uses, such as housing, arts, and retail space. In 1996, the 100-member Interactive Downtown Task Force developed a “Vision and Action Plan,” including recommendations for new retail and entertainment venues, visual and performing arts facilities, an intermodal transportation center, a Downtown Arts Committee, and international communication and trade facilities. The Plan led to the formation of the Downtown Business Improvement District in 1997 and tax increment financing legislation in 1998. 1701.10 By 2000, the targets set in the early 1980s were finally becoming approachable realities. The Downtown Action Agenda of 2000 provided an updated framework for decisions, established a new vision, and set new goals for the Traditional Downtown. An update of the Agenda was launched in July 2006, 366 providing an opportunity to develop new goals and strategies for the coming years. 1701.11 Land Use 1702 Land use statistics for the Planning Area appear in Figure 17.1. Central Washington comprises about 3,285 acres, or about 7.5 percent of the city. About 510 acres of the total area consists of water. 1702.1 [INSERT Figure 17.1:Land Use Composition in the Central Washington Area 1702.6 [Pie chart “slices” unchanged from July draft] Compared to the other nine Planning Areas in the city, Central Washington contains much higher percentages of commercial and federal land. Commercial land represents 17 percent of the total, with about two-thirds of the acreage developed with private office buildings. Non-park federal land also represents 17 percent of the total. Much of this land is also developed with offices, but in this case the owner and occupant is the federal government. 1702.2 Almost one-third of the Planning Area consists of street rights-of-way, a slightly higher percentage than for the city as a whole. Almont one-quarter of the land area is open space, which is also higher than the average for the city as a whole. Much of the open space is contained within the National Mall and almost all of the remainder is comprised of federal “reservations” managed by the National Park Service. The federal open space has significant programming restrictions, limiting its use for local purposes and District activities. 1702.3 Residential land comprises just 1.6 percent of the Planning Area. Almost of all of this acreage consists of mid- to high-rise apartments, with average densities exceeding 100 units per acre. Most of the residential AREA ELEM ENTS COMPREHENSIVE PLAN DISTRICT ELEMENTS ADOPTED 12/19/06 P. 2-28 development is located in the northern part of the Planning Area, near Dupont Circle, along the Massachusetts Avenue corridor, and in the Northwest One Urban Renewal Area. Another concentration is located in the Penn Quarter, around 7th and D Streets NW. There is no residential development south of the National Mall and north of I-395. 1702.4 The percentages of land area in other uses, such as institutions, public facilities, and utilities, are all relatively small. Only about 2.1 percent of the Planning Area consists of vacant, unimproved private land. 1702.5 Most land in Central Washington is publicly owned. Government uses, including parks, federal land, streets, and public facilities, represent 76 percent of the area’s acreage. When institutions are added in, the figure approaches 80 percent. 1702.6 [PULLQUOTE: Most land in Central Washington is publicly owned. Government uses, including parks, federal land, streets, and public facilities, represent 76 percent of the area’s acreage. When institutions are added in, the figure approaches 80 percent.] Demographics 1703 Basic demographic data for Central Washington is shown in Table 17.1. In 2000, the area had a population of 10,665, or about 1.8 percent of the city’s total. By 2005, population had increased to about 15,700, as more than a dozen large apartment or condominium complexes were added. Household size is estimated at about 1.75, which is well below the citywide average of 2.12. 1703.1 Relative to the city as a whole, Central Washington has a higher percentage of seniors and a lower percentage of children. About 42 percent of the area’s residents lived in the same house in 2000 as they 367 did in 1995. This is below the citywide average and is indicative of a relatively mobile population. 1703.2 Approximately 60 percent of the area’s residents are African-American, which is on par with the citywide average. About 26 percent of the area’s residents are White, which is just slightly below the citywide average. The area includes a higher percentage of foreign-born residents than the city as a whole, and a lower percentage of residents of Hispanic origin. Almost nine percent of Central Washington’s residents are Asian, which is three times the citywide average. 1703.3 Housing Characteristics 1704 The 2000 Census reported that 90 percent of Central Washington’s 5,880 housing units were in multifamily buildings; 75 percent were in buildings with more than 50 units each. These percentages have increased in the last five years as almost all new housing in the Planning Area has consisted of large multi-unit buildings. The area contains fewer than 100 single family detached homes. 1704.1 The 2000 Census reported that 89 percent of the households in the Planning Area were renters and only 11 percent were homeowners. This balance is shifting as a growing share of new construction consists of owner-occupied condominiums. Based on projects under construction today, the percentage of renteroccupied units is likely to decline to between 60 and 70 percent by the next Census. 1704.2 In 2000, nearly 12 percent of the housing units in Central Washington were vacant. This is slightly higher than the citywide average of 9.6 percent. 1704.3 AREA ELEM ENTS COMPREHENSIVE PLAN DISTRICT ELEMENTS ADOPTED 12/19/06 P. 2-29 Table 16.1: Central Washington At a Glance 1703.4 Basic Statistics Land Area (square miles) 4.3 Population 1990 10,525 2000 10,665 2005 (estimated 15,700 2025 (projected 30,000 Households (2005 8,000 Household Population (2005 exclu des grou p qu arters 13,800 Persons Per Household (2005 1.73 Jobs (2005 423,000 Density (persons per sq mile 2005 3,700 Year 2000 Census Data Profile Far Northeast and Southeast Planning Area Citywide Total of Total of Total Age Under 18 1,895 17.8 20.0 18-65 7,219 67.7 67.8 Over 65 1,551 14.5 12.3 Residents Below Poverty Level 3,257 30.5 20.2 Racial Composition White 2,757 25.9 30.4 Black 6,450 60.5 60.3 Native American 28 0.3 0.3 Asian/ Pacific Islander 952 8.9 2.6 Other 247 2.3 3.8 Multi-Racial 231 2.2 5.2 Hispanic Origin 588 5.5 7.9 Foreign-Born Residents 1,788 16.7 12.9 Tenure Owner Households 571 11.0 40.7 Renter Households 4,611 89.0 59.3 Population 5+ yrs in same house in 2000 as in 1995 4,327 42.6 46.9 Housing Occupancy Occupied Units 5,182 88.1 90.4 Vacant Units 698 11.9 9.6 Housing by Unit Type 1-unit detached 93 1.6 13.1 1-unit attached 380 6.5 26.4 368 2-4 units 125 2.1 11.0 5-9 units 166 2.8 8.0 10-19 units 340 5.8 10.3 20-49 units 379 6.4 7.4 50+ units 4,398 74.8 23.3 Mobile/ other 0 0 0.2 Figures noted with an asterisk are estimates developed by the Office of Planning and Department of Employment Services based on a variety of data sources Total population of subcategories may not match 2000 Census totals due to sampling errors. AREA ELEM ENTS COMPREHENSIVE PLAN DISTRICT ELEMENTS ADOPTED 12/19/06 P. 2-30 Income and Employment 1705 Data from the Department of Employment Services and the Office of Planning indicates there were approximately 423,000 jobs in Central Washington in 2005, primarily in the government, professional, and non-profit sectors. This represents about 57 percent of the city’s job base. Year 2000 Census “journey to work” data states that 150,000 Maryland commuters and 115,000 Virginia commuters traveled into Central Washington every day to work. Another 90,000 residents from the other nine planning areas of the District of Columbia also commute into Central Washington each day.1 1705.1 [PULLQUOTE: Data from the Department of Employment Services and the Office of Planning indicates there were approximately 423,000 jobs in Central Washington in 2005, primarily in the government, professional, and non-profit sectors. This represents about 57 percent of the city’s job base.] About 39 percent of the inbound commuters drive alone to work and about 38 percent take public transit. Some 18 percent carpool or vanpool and five percent walk or bicycle. The high volume of commute traffic strains the area’s road network on a daily basis, and places a premium on convenient, high- quality transit. 1705.2 In 2000, the Census indicated the median household income in the Planning Area was $27,879. This is substantially below the citywide average of $45,927. More than 30 percent of the area’s residents lived below the federal poverty level in 2000. However, the addition of thousands of market-rate condominiums and apartments since 2000 has undoubtedly brought a sharp rise in median household income since then. 1705.3 Census data indicates that about 47 percent of the area’s employed residents hold jobs within Central Washington. About 30 percent work elsewhere in the District, and the remaining 23 percent reverse commute to suburban jobs. 1705.4 Projections 1706 Based on projects that are under construction, approved, or proposed; regional growth trends; and the planning policies articulated by the Comprehensive Plan, significant growth is expected in Central Washington during the next 20 years. The Planning Area is expected to grow from 8,000 households in 2005 to 16,400 households in 2025. Population will nearly double from about 15,700 residents today to about 30,000 residents by 2025. Most of the growth in Central Washington is expected to consist of new high-density housing, particularly in the Mount Vernon Triangle and NoMA areas. Medium and moderate density housing is also anticipated, as communities like Sursum Corda/ Northwest One are redeveloped. 1706.1 The number of jobs is expected to increase from about 423,000 today to 490,000 in 2025. This represents just over half of the total increase in employment projected for the District of Columbia between 2005 and 2025. Most of the increase will take place in NoMA and on the eastern side of the traditional Downtown. Major development sites such as the Old Convention Center also will generate a significant 369 number of new jobs. Replacement of some of the aging building stock in the traditional Downtown, Near Southwest, and Golden Triangle areas also can be expected. 1706.2 [Photo Caption: Renovated John A. Wilson Building, the District’s “City Hall”] 1 These figures add to less than 423,000 due to the growth in employment (about 32,000 jobs) since 2000, and the fact that only workers with regular daily commutes in and out of Central Washington are counted. AREA ELEM ENTS COMPREHENSIVE PLAN DISTRICT ELEMENTS ADOPTED 12/19/06 P. 2-31 Planning and Development Priorities 1707 Priorities for Central Washington were discussed at Comprehensive Plan community workshops throughout 2005 and 2006. Several meetings with the Advisory Neighborhood Commissions that include Central Washington were conducted. Briefings to business and trade organizations with a stake in Downtown’s future also took place. The revision process also included a Small Group Discussion on Downtown in October 2005. About 25 participants representing an array of Central Washington neighborhoods and interests were present. 1707.1 The following priorities for Central Washington were expressed through this process: 1707.2 (a) The vision of a mixed use “living downtown” remains even more applicable today than it was 30 years ago when it was conceived. A priority should continue to be placed on diversifying the mix of Downtown land uses to strengthen its role as the heart of the city. The area is already the center of one of the largest urban office markets in the world. Strengthening Central Washington as a creative, vibrant urban center will require more housing, retail, and arts and entertainment venues. It will also require facilitating the expansion of the traditional Downtown to the east and southeast. Capital projects, financial and development incentives, and continued strong leadership will be needed to create the desired mix of uses b) The Central Area should be a diverse place and its diversity should be reflected on many levels. Not only should it feature a mix of uses, but it should serve a variety of users, including Downtown and city residents, workers and visitors from across the region, as well as those from the rest of the country and the world. Downtown retailers should serve customers with a variety of income levels, and retailers themselves should include small, locally grown businesses as well as national chains. Non-profits and those who cannot afford Class A office rents also provide desirable diversity. Participants in Comp Plan discussions stated that further efforts should be made to nurture Downtown’s developing mix of fine restaurants, theaters, galleries, clubs, and retail shops—and to complement these uses with attractive public spaces to achieve the eclectic, organic, high-energy character that defines cities like London and New York c) In addition to being diverse, Downtown should be authentic. This should be expressed through its appreciation and celebration of its history, culture and heritage. Thus, priority should be placed on the preservation of buildings, places and uses which express these qualities. Recent efforts to restore the former Carnegie Library Building, create farmers markets, and improve the Central Library to provide space for cultural celebrations are examples of actions which contribute to the feeling of authenticity. Chinatown presents an interesting case. While on the one hand, preserving Chinatown’s authenticity has to be about more than just preserving facades or using Chinese characters on street signs, on the other hand, there has been a marked reduction in the number of Chinese businesses. It remains to be seen if Chinatown can maintain an authentic role as the center of a dispersed Asian community. Historic 370 preservation should be strongly promoted Downtown where the historic fabric is still largely intact, but contemporary architecture also should flourish in places where new construction is appropriate. [Photo Caption: H Street NW, Chinatown] (d) One issue raised during the Comprehensive Plan revision was the question of who Downtown Washington “belongs” to. The Mall may be a national gathering place, but many District residents do not perceive it as “theirs.” Downtown should function as the city’s “Commons”, a place where residents AREA ELEM ENTS COMPREHENSIVE PLAN DISTRICT ELEMENTS ADOPTED 12/19/06 P. 2-32 can come, feel welcome, celebrate good times and, when necessary, even protest about District issues. The former Convention Center site should provide a great physical site for the expression of the Commons. There is a need for other public gathering places, events, and activities that reinforce Central Washington’s role as the great melting pot that serves all of the city’s neighborhoods e) Central Washington’s design is unique among American cities. Its distinguishing qualities, including its diagonal avenues, monumental buildings, low building heights, and open spaces, are viewed as some of the District of Columbia’s greatest assets. It is essential that new buildings reflect this character and add to the sense of place. In particular, attention must be paid to how buildings meet the street. Curb cuts, blank walls, and inactive ground floor uses should be minimized. Loading and parking entrances should be off of alleys as much as possible. As noted in the Urban Design Element of the Comprehensive Plan, the identity of Central Washington’s multiple centers needs to be more clearly defined, and the connections between them need to be improved. [PULLQUOTE: Central Washington’s design is unique among American cities. Its distinguishing qualities, including its diagonal avenues, monumental buildings, low building heights, and open spaces, are viewed as some of the District of Columbia’s greatest assets.] (f) While recognizing Central Washington’s national and international role, the area should also play a special role for our own citizens. It should serve the multiple needs of all its citizens, without regard to age, class or ethnic background. Many activities serving very low-income persons and those with special needs—including social services, low cost housing, and emergency shelter—have faced displacement as land values and rents have increased. Given the area’s location, urban character, and accessibility, a significant number of special needs housing units and human service facilities should be retained in the future. This should be achieved by preserving the affordable housing units left, preserving (or replacing) emergency shelter space, and creating new forms of affordable housing that work best in a Downtown setting such as Single Room Occupancy hotels. Other social service facilities, such as day care centers and job training facilities, are needed to sustain Downtown as a community hub g) Central Washington is the hub of the metropolitan transportation system with 15 Metrorail stations, commuter and interstate rail terminals, and major bridges, freeway, and surface street infrastructure. However, to retain its central role, it must overcome transportation challenges including: Some Metrorail stations that are nearing capacity Recent security-related street closures that have constricted traffic Conflicts between street activities, such as truck deliveries, bus stops, taxi stands, and parking Conflicts between building perimeter security and pedestrian circulation An inadequate supply of parking to meet shopper and visitor needs Confusing signage and a lack of information about routes and transportation services 371 The DC Circulator has been an important step to connect Central Washington destinations to one another, but additional improvements are needed. Improving east-west and north-south circulation, and improving parking management continue to be high priorities. Supporting Metro’s efforts to increase capacity— especially at Metro Center—also should be a priority h) The “federal” city and “domestic” city should be connected as one, as they are in other great national capital cities. The Mall’s museums and attractions are ringed by imposing federal office buildings that offer few amenities or opportunities for visitors— or even their own employees and little indication of what lies a few blocks beyond. The expansion of development and redevelopment around the mall should begin to diminish these distinctions, and provide more amenities closer to the Mall. There will need to be special efforts to draw tourists into Downtown, such as signage and streetscape improvements, new transportation modes (like the Circulator and the development of new attractions AREA ELEM ENTS COMPREHENSIVE PLAN DISTRICT ELEMENTS ADOPTED 12/19/06 P. 2-33 like the Newseum and Spy Museum in the heart of Downtown. In addition to the urban design benefits of unifying the Mall and Downtown, there are other obvious benefits as more visitors choose to dine, shop, and stay in the District. Waterfront park improvements provide another way to tie the city together; developing a continuous 11-mile band of waterfront open space from Georgetown to the Arboretum was an important theme of the NCPC Legacy Plan and will continue to be a priority in the future. [PULLQUOTE: The “federal” city and “domestic” city should be connected as one, as they are in other great national capital cities.] (i) Downtown’s growth and success should continue to benefit residents of the District of Columbia. Downtown already plays a pre-eminent role in the economic health of the city, producing a net benefit of $600 million per year in tax revenues. In addition, the growth of retail trade, hotels, restaurants, and other services will create many entry-level jobs. The continued development of office space will create new clerical, professional, mid-level, and management jobs in emerging and growing professions. Job placement, apprenticeships, and training programs are needed to ensure that District residents can take advantage of these opportunities j) While Downtown has been among the top office markets in the world since the beginning of the decade, the health of that market should not be taken for granted. Changes in security policies on the part of the Defense Department will result in the abandonment of over four million square feet of office space in Arlington alone, most of it proximate to Metro stations, and already less costly per square foot than Downtown office space. This situation will require achieving a delicate balance between using the strength of the Downtown office economy to leverage public benefits without hindering its ability to compete with other jurisdictions for office tenants k) Central Washington should continue to lead the way in the city’s overall efforts toward environmental sustainability. While Downtown’s density of uses, and its extensive reliance on public transportation help it to score high on any index of sustainability, more can be done, both to influence transportation choices and the development of “green buildings.” Policies and Actions CW-1.1 Guiding Growth and Neighborhood Conservation 1708 The following general policies and actions should guide growth and neighborhood conservation 372 decisions in Central Washington. These policies and actions should be considered in tandem with those in the citywide elements of the Comprehensive Plan. 1708.1 Policy CW-1.1.1: Promoting Mixed Use Development Expand the mix of land uses in Central Washington to attract a broader variety of activities and sustain the area as the hub of the metropolitan area. Central Washington should be strengthened as a dynamic employment center, a high-quality regional retail center, an internationally-renowned cultural center, a world-class visitor and convention destination, a vibrant urban neighborhood, and the focus of the regional transportation network. New office and retail space, hotels, arts and entertainment uses, housing, and open space should be encouraged through strategic incentives so that the area remains attractive, exciting, and economically productive. 1708.2 See also the Urban Design and Land Use Elements for additional policies related to Downtown growth. AREA ELEM ENTS COMPREHENSIVE PLAN DISTRICT ELEMENTS ADOPTED 12/19/06 P. 2-34 Policy CW-1.1.2: Central Washington Office Growth Retain Central Washington as the premier office location in the Greater Washington region. Office development should generally be guided eastward from its current area of concentration, filling in the gap between 3rd Street NW and North Capitol Street (south of Massachusetts Avenue and capitalizing on the growing demand for office space along North and South Capitol Streets and in the vicinity of the New York Avenue Metro station. A range of office space should be planned to meet the needs of high- end, mid-range, and low-end office space users. 1708.3 See also the Economic Development Element for additional policies related to growth of the office economy. [Photo Caption: Seventh Street NW] Policy CW-1.1.3: Incentives for Non-Office Uses Because market forces tend to favor office development over other land uses in Central Washington, take action to attract the other desired land uses within the area. For example, the District’s zoning regulations should include incentives for mixed use development, including housing, ground floor retail, educational uses, and arts facilities, in locations consistent with the Comprehensive Plan. 1708.4 Policy CW-1.1.4: New Housing Development in Central Washington Encourage the development of new high-density housing in Central Washington, particularly in the area north of Massachusetts Avenue and east of Mount Vernon Square. This area includes Mount Vernon Triangle, Northwest One, and NoMA. Ground floor retail space and similar uses should be strongly encouraged within these areas to create street-life and provide neighborhood services for residents. A strong Downtown residential community can create pedestrian traffic, meet local housing needs, support local businesses in the evenings and on weekends, and increase neighborhood safety and security. 1708.5 See also the Housing Element for additional policies relating to Downtown housing production. Policy CW-1.1.5: Central Washington Housing Diversity Preserve Central Washington’s existing low- to moderate-income housing, including public housing, Section 8 housing—both contracts and vouchers—and other subsidized units. While this will be expensive, it is important to keep Central Washington a mixed income community and avoid the displacement of lower income residents. 1708.6 [Photo Caption: Market Square, Penn Quarter] 373 Policy CW-1.1.6: Capturing Visitor and Employee Spending Capture a greater share of the demand for goods and services generated by the more than 400,000 persons working in Central Washington, and the millions of tourists who visit the area each year by supporting additional retail and restaurant development. This will generate substantial jobs, tax revenues, and social and economic benefits for the city. 1708.7 Policy CW-1.1.7: Central Washington Arts and Entertainment Uses Retain, enhance, and expand Central Washington’s arts and entertainment uses, including theaters, cinemas, galleries, studios, museums, and related services. Cultural uses should be actively encouraged in the area along 7th Street NW (between the National Mall and the Convention Center and along the E Street corridor (between 5th and 15th Streets NW) The clustering of arts uses in these areas should complement the significant cultural institutions already present or planned, such as the Smithsonian AREA ELEM ENTS COMPREHENSIVE PLAN DISTRICT ELEMENTS ADOPTED 12/19/06 P. 2-35 museums (including the renovated National Portrait Gallery and Smithsonian American Art Museum the Corcoran Gallery of Art, the Newseum, and the numerous Downtown theaters. 1708.8 See also the Economic Development Element for further policies relating to growth of the tourism and hospitality economy, and policies in the Arts and Culture Element on the promotion of Downtown arts and live-work housing for artists. Policy CW-1.1.8: Promote Central Washington Retail Develop and promote Central Washington as a regional retail destination. Particular emphasis should be placed on sustaining a concentrated regional shopping area at a) The F and G Street corridors between 7th and 15th Streets NW (b) Seventh Street NW in the Gallery Place and Penn Quarter neighborhoods; and (c) The Old Convention Center site. The design of streets and facades in these areas should be conducive to pedestrian-oriented shopping, with wide sidewalks, window displays, well managed on-street vending activities, outdoor seating areas, and other shopper amenities. A mix of traditional large-format retail anchors and specialty shops should be encouraged. In particular, support should be provided to attract one or two additional boutique department stores to these areas. 1708.9 See also the Economic Development and Urban Design Elements for additional policies relating to the retail sector. [Photo Caption: Gallup Building at 9th and F Streets] Policy CW-1.1.9: Neighborhood-Serving Retail in Central Washington Ensure that Central Washington’s retail uses serve not only the regional market, but also the local neighborhood market created by residential development within the area. This should include basic consumer goods like drug stores, hardware stores, and grocery stores, to supplement the major anchors and specialty shops. 1708.10 Policy CW-1.1.10: Central Washington Hotels and Hospitality Services Encourage the development of additional hotels in Central Washington, especially in the areas around the new Convention Center and Gallery Place, along Pennsylvania Avenue NW and Massachusetts Avenue NW, in the Thomas Circle area, and in the area east of Third Street NW. A range of hotel types, including moderately priced hotels, and hotels oriented to family travelers as well as business 374 travelers, should be encouraged. Hotels generate jobs for District residents and revenues for the general fund and should be granted incentives when necessary. Retain existing hotel uses by allowing and encouraging the expansion of those uses, including the addition of one floor, approximately 16 feet in height subject to coordination with federal security needs, to the Hay-Adams Hotel. 1708.11 Policy CW-1.1.11: Leveraging Public Development Sites Use publicly-owned development sites, such as urban renewal sites, WMATA joint development sites, and the former Washington Convention Center site to implement key objectives and policies of the Central Washington Area Element, especially with respect to land use and urban design. These sites should be viewed as a portfolio of assets that must be strategically managed to meet the long term needs of the District. 1708.12 Policy CW-1.1.12: Reinforcing Central Washington’s Characteristic Design Features Reinforce the physical qualities that set Central Washington apart from all other major American city centers, including the L’Enfant framework of diagonal avenues and park reservations, relatively low AREA ELEM ENTS COMPREHENSIVE PLAN DISTRICT ELEMENTS ADOPTED 12/19/06 P. 2-36 building heights, the great open spaces of the National Mall and Tidal Basin, the large number of historic and/ or monumental buildings, and the blending of historic and contemporary architecture. 1708.13 [Photo Caption: Recent Downtown construction] Policy CW-1.1.13: Creating Active Street Life and Public Spaces Promote active street life throughout Central Washington through the design of buildings, streets, and public spaces. This should include a) discouraging second-level pedestrian bridges or underground walkways that drain activity from Central Washington streets b) encouraging multiple entrances in large projects to increase street-level activity c) managing certain streets so they can be easily closed to traffic on special occasions for use by pedestrians d) providing streetscape improvements that make Downtown streets more comfortable and attractive e) encouraging active ground floor uses, and discouraging wide building entrances, large internal lobbies, and street-facing garage entrances and loading areas f) creating and managing well designed public spaces that provide space for spontaneous performances, programmed entertainment, and social interaction; and (g) supporting collaboration with the National Park Service on measures to allow for recreation space as well as local and federal monuments and national memorials on federally-owned parks in the heart of the central business district such as Pershing Park, and Franklin, McPherson, and Farragut Squares h) continuing the effort started more than 45 years ago to revitalize Pennsylvania Avenue through measures such as improved lighting, landscaping, and better use of Freedom Plaza. 1708.14 See also the Urban Design Element for additional policies relating to improving the public realm and creating active Downtown street environments. [Photo Caption: L Street NW, Golden Triangle] Policy CW-1.1.14: Central Washington Multi-modal Transportation System Develop and maintain a balanced multi-modal transportation system for Central Washington which makes optimal use of the existing street network, the Metrorail and commuter rail networks, the bus system, and public spaces including sidewalks and alleys. Mass transit should be supported as the dominant form of transportation to, from, and around the area. 1708.15 Policy CW-1.1.15: Increasing Central Washington’s Transit Mode Share 375 Improve public transit and other means of non-automobile access to Central Washington to the point where 70 percent of all peak hour trips into the area are made by a mode other than a single occupant vehicle. Based on 2000 Census data, the split for the Central Washington Planning Area was 60/40, with 40 percent of all commuters driving to work alone. Public transit should be emphasized as the preferred means of access to and around Central Washington by a) giving priority to public transit vehicles on the area’s streets (b) promoting the use of public transit for commuting (c) encouraging direct connections from Metrorail stations to adjacent development (d) improving the availability of information and signage about public transit service (e) developing new forms of transit such as circulators and trolleys, and (f) improving public transit service, particularly during off peak hours g) photo enforcement of traffic signals (red light cameras) 1708.16 AREA ELEM ENTS COMPREHENSIVE PLAN DISTRICT ELEMENTS ADOPTED 12/19/06 P. 2-37 Policy CW-1.1.16: Central Washington Parking Management Develop creative, effective solutions to manage Downtown parking demand. These solutions should be responsive to the needs of local retailers and businesses without inducing excessive auto traffic or discouraging transit use. Incentives for short-term parking within private garages, the sharing of parking by multiple uses with different demand characteristics, and better parking signage are all strongly encouraged. 1708.17 See also the Transportation Element for additional policies on shared parking and parking management Policy CW-1.1.17: Making Central Washington’s Streets More Pedestrian-Friendly Enhance Central Washington’s pedestrian network and improve pedestrian safety. This should be achieved through such measures as a) Improving certain streets for pedestrian use b) Providing safe and accessible pedestrian waiting space on the widest thoroughfares c) Maintaining sufficiently wide sidewalks and regulating sidewalk obstructions d) Restricting curb cuts and parking garage access along major streets e) Providing safe and accessible pedestrian detours at construction sites; and (f) Encouraging sidewalk widening within private development g) Enforcement of traffic and parking laws, such as no parking zones 1708.18 Policy CW-1.1.18: Cross-town Circulation Strengthen transportation connections between Central Washington and the rest of the city by improving east-west connections such as F Street NW and north-south connections such as 7th and 9th Streets. 1708.19 See also policies in the Land Use, Urban Design, and Transportation Elements discouraging street closures in and around the District Policy CW-1.1.19: Goods Movement and Service Delivery within Central Washington Strongly discourage the obstruction of public rights-of-way by goods and service delivery activities. Provide for the efficient and convenient movement of goods and delivery of services within Central Washington by a) maintaining and improving interior alleys where needed to provide for off street loading facilities and minimize curb cuts on streets b) encouraging the consolidation of loading areas within new development and limiting on-street service deliveries c) requiring adequate off street or below grade loading and service parking areas d) converting on street loading facilities to off street facilities whenever possible; and (e) managing goods and service delivery times. 1708.20 See the Transportation Element for additional policies on goods delivery [Photo Caption: Street vendor, North Capitol Street] Policy CW-1.1.20: Wayfinding Signage Maintain, upgrade, and manage pedestrian, bicycle, and vehicular signage within Central Washington 376 to improve connections within the area, and between the area and the rest of the city. Street signs, directional signs, and maps should provide clear information on travel routes, emergency routes and procedures, parking, and transit operations. 1708.21 See the Urban Design Element for additional policies on signage AREA ELEM ENTS COMPREHENSIVE PLAN DISTRICT ELEMENTS ADOPTED 12/19/06 P. 2-38 Policy CW-1.1.21: Central Washington Capital Improvements Invest in capital projects that improve the quality of Central Washington’s environment, stimulate private investment, accommodate projected growth, and set the stage for the area to achieve its full economic and quality of life potential. To create the necessary revenue stream for these improvements, a significant share of the tax revenues generated by development in Central Washington should be reinvested within the area. No less than three percent of Central Washington’s real property tax revenues should be directed to capital improvements in this area annually. 1708.22 Action CW-1.1-A: Downtown Action Agenda Update Update the 2000 Downtown Action Agenda as a “Center City Action Agenda.” The updated agenda should include a five-year list of actions to ensure development of the center city into a dynamic mixed use area. Study area boundaries should extend from Georgetown to Capitol Hill on the west and east and Dupont Circle to Buzzard Point on the north and south, with a particular focus on NoMA and the areas south of I-395. The Action Agenda should include updated land use “targets” to guide future development and marketing strategies. It should also address the relationship between the Central Employment Area and the “ring” of residential neighborhoods on its perimeter. 1708.23 Action CW-1.1-B: Land Use and Transportation Planning for Central Washington Conduct ongoing land use and transportation research and planning for Central Washington, including the collection and analysis of data on the area’s employment, population, housing, visitor, land use, development, travel pattern, and economic characteristics. This research and planning is necessary to monitor Central Washington’s competitive position in the nation and region and to make policy recommendations to maintain its health. This activity should be done in concert with the National Capital Planning Commission (NCPC the DC Economic Partnership, and the local Business Improvement Districts. 1708.24 Action CW-1.1-C: Central Washington Urban Design Planning Continue to develop plans and guidelines for the design of buildings, streets, and public spaces in Central Washington. Design guidelines should help implement the Comprehensive Plan by reinforcing the unique identity of Central Washington’s sub-areas and neighborhoods, improving connections to the National Mall, encouraging pedestrian movement, creating active street life, preserving historic resources, promoting green roofs and other sustainable design principles, and achieving high quality architectural design. 1708.25 [PULLQUOTE: Design guidelines should help implement the Comprehensive Plan by reinforcing the unique identity of Central Washington’s sub-areas and neighborhoods, improving connections to the National Mall, encouraging pedestrian movement, creating active street life, preserving historic resources, promoting green roofs and other sustainable design principles, and achieving high quality architectural design.] Action CW-1.1-D: Focused Planning for “Catalytic” Sites Develop detailed plans for “catalytic” sites with the potential to significantly shape the future of Central Washington. These sites include but are not limited to the Old Convention Center site, the I-395 air 377 rights between D Street and Massachusetts Avenue NW, the Northwest One neighborhood, the air rights north of Union Station, and the former Carnegie Library on Mount Vernon Square. Encourage the federal government to prepare plans for similar sites under their jurisdiction such as Freedom Plaza, the old Post Office on Pennsylvania Avenue NW, Old Naval Observatory Hill, and the area around the Kennedy Center. 1708.26 AREA ELEM ENTS COMPREHENSIVE PLAN DISTRICT ELEMENTS ADOPTED 12/19/06 P. 2-39 Action CW-1.1.E: Public Space Regulations Simplify public space regulations for Downtown to avoid duplicative or inconsistent standards and overly complex permitting requirements. 1708.27 Action CW-1.1.F: Residential Development Incentives Develop incentives for the conversion of lower-performing retail/office buildings into new housing or mixed use development throughout Central Washington. 1708.28 Action CW-1.1.G: Tax and Financial Incentives for “Preferred” Land Uses and Infrastructure Investments Apply a range of tax and financial incentives to assist in achieving the land use objectives for Central Washington. These incentives could include such measures as reduced taxes and financial assistance for preferred land uses, tax increment financing, PILOTs (payments in lieu of taxes the use of special tax districts, and the involvement of the Housing Finance Agency and other entities that produce affordable housing or provide other public benefits. 1708.29 Action CW-1.1.H: Congestion Task Force Report Recommendations Implement the recommendations of the Mayor’s 2005 Downtown Congestion Task Force. 1708.30 CW-1.2 Conserving and Enhancing Community Resources 1709 Policy CW-1.2.1: Enhancing the Identity of Central Washington Neighborhoods Enhance the sense of identity of the different neighborhoods within Central Washington based on their history and natural features, their ethnic and cultural heritage, the design and scale of their buildings, and the types of activities and uses they support. Unique identities should be established in the emerging areas around Washington’s traditional Downtown, rather than replicating existing development patterns. 1709.1 Policy CW-1.2.2: Preservation of Central Washington’s Historic Resources Protect and enhance Central Washington’s historic resources by continuing the current practices of a) preserving the area’s historic buildings and districts (b) requiring that renovation and new construction is sensitive to the character of historic buildings and districts (c) applying design incentives and requirements to encourage preservation, adaptive reuse, and appropriate relationships between historic development and new construction (d) encouraging the adaptive reuse of historic and architecturally significant buildings (e) preserving the original L’Enfant Plan pattern of streets and alleys, especially alleys that provide for off-street loading, deliveries, and garage access 1709.2 Historic resources should be recognized as essential to Downtown’s economic vitality and competitive edge, particularly for retail, tourist, and entertainment activities. 1709.3 See also the Historic Preservation Element for additional policies related to historic resources. Policy CW-1.2.3: Central Washington Open Space Provide high quality outdoor public spaces throughout Central Washington. This should include the development of new open spaces, such as a civic plaza on the site of the Old Convention Center. It 378 should also include enhancements to existing open spaces such as Judiciary Square (in accordance with the approved Judiciary Square Master Plan In addition, the area’s triangle parks should be enhanced as an important element of the L’Enfant Plan. Parks and open spaces in Central Washington should be wellmaintained, well-designed, and appropriately programmed based on their location, context, historic significance, and design features. 1709.4 AREA ELEM ENTS COMPREHENSIVE PLAN DISTRICT ELEMENTS ADOPTED 12/19/06 P. 2-40 [Photo Caption: Franklin Square] Policy CW-1.2.4: Recreation for New Downtown Residents and Workers Ensure that emerging residential and employment centers such as Northwest One, NoMA and Mount Vernon Triangle include adequate parks, open spaces, and recreational facilities for residents, workers and other users. The use of payment-in-lieu-of-taxes (PILOTs) to fund such improvements should be explored. 1709.5 See also Parks, Recreation and Open Space for policies regarding new parks [Photo Caption: Freedom Plaza] Policy CW-1.2.5: Central Washington Economic Opportunity Develop programs to maximize the economic benefits of development in Central Washington for District residents. A priority should be placed on programs which link District residents to jobs in the area; programs that retain, assist, and expand small and minority businesses; and programs that avoid the displacement of small or locally-owned businesses. 1709.6 See also the Economic Development Element for policies relating to small businesses and commercial gentrification. Policy CW-1.2.6: Central Washington Social Services Continue the important role that Central Washington plays in the District’s social service delivery system, particularly in the provision of health care and medical services, and services for the homeless, elderly, disabled, and others with special needs. Ensure that centrally located facilities providing these services are retained or added as the city’s population and employment base expand. 1709.7 Policy CW-1.2.7: Central Washington Leadership and Management Achieve Central Washington planning objectives through leadership and management strategies as well as land use, transportation, and design strategies. Support the activities of local Business or Community Improvement Districts to coordinate special events, marketing, planning and design, business development, maintenance and security, transportation, and joint development activities. 1709.8 Policy CW-1.2.8: Building a Sense of Community in Central Washington Encourage the involvement of Central Washington residents in planning and community development decisions. Given the expected influx of new residents into the area and the historically transient character of its population, this will be important to create a stronger sense of community ownership and neighborhood pride. 1709.9 Action CW-1.2-A: Business and Community Improvement Districts Support the activities of the Central Washington Business Improvement Districts (BIDs) and Community Improvement Districts (CIDs) within Central Washington. Encourage partnerships between these entities and District government to achieve local job training, job placement, and business assistance goals. 1709.10 See also the Economic Development Element for additional policies related to economic and 379 business development. AREA ELEM ENTS COMPREHENSIVE PLAN DISTRICT ELEMENTS ADOPTED 12/19/06 P. 2-41 Action CW-1.2-B: Central Washington Open Space Planning Work with the National Capital Planning Commission and the National Park Service in the planning and programming of Central Washington’s major open spaces, including participation in the National Capital Framework Plan and the National Mall Comprehensive Management Plan. In addition, work with the federal government to develop unique management policies and procedures for the smaller (non- Mall) Central Washington federal parks. 1709.11 More specific actions relating to community resources are contained in the Policy Focus area discussions below. CW-2.0 Policy Focus Areas 1710 The Comprehensive Plan identifies eight areas in Central Washington as “policy focus areas,” indicating that they require a level of direction and guidance beyond that provided in the prior section of this Area Element and in the citywide elements. These eight areas are: Metro Center/ Retail Core Gallery Place/ Penn Quarter Chinatown Mount Vernon District Downtown East/ Judiciary Square Golden Triangle/ K Street L’Enfant Plaza/ Near Southwest NoMA/ Northwest One 1710.1 With a few exceptions, these areas exclude what is commonly thought of as the “federal city”, in other words the portions of Central Washington under federal jurisdiction. Planning for these areas, which include the Kennedy Center, the Federal Triangle, the Northwest Rectangle, the Southwest Federal Center, and East Potomac Park is the responsibility of the National Capital Planning Commission (NCPC NCPC recently launched its “National Capital Framework Plan” to address the future of these areas. NCPC and the National Park Service are also engaged in planning for the National Mall. Similarly, the Architect of the Capitol is engaged in an update of the U.S. Capitol Master Plan. The discussions below are complementary to federal policy initiatives and result in a unified vision for the future of the central city. 1710.2 AREA ELEM ENTS COMPREHENSIVE PLAN DISTRICT ELEMENTS ADOPTED 12/19/06 P. 2-42 Table 16.2: Policy Focus Areas Within and Adjacent to Central Washington 1610.3 Within Central Washington 2.1 Metro Center Retail Core (see p. 17-24) 2.2 Gallery Place/ Penn Quarter (see p. 17-28) 2.3 Chinatown (see p. 17-30) 2.4 Mount Vernon District (see p. 17-32) 2.5 Downtown East/ Judiciary Square (see p. 17-35) 2.6 Golden Triangle/ K Street (see p. 17-37) 2.7 L’Enfant Plaza/ Near Southwest (see p. 17-39) 380 2.8 NoM A/ Northwest One (see p. 17-40) Adjacent to Central Washington 1 Foggy Bottom/ West End (see p. 21-28) 2 Dupont Circle (see p. 21-24) 3 14 th Street/ Logan Circles (see p. 21-26) 4 Shaw/ Convention Center Area (see p. 21-19) 5 N.

The area also includes Downtown’s largest department store, other major retailers, many large office buildings, hotels, theaters, and restaurants. At the heart of this area, the Metro Center subway station is one of the busiest stations in the Metrorail system and is a major transfer point between intersecting Metro lines. 1711.2 While the Retail Core has enjoyed a comeback since 2000, it is not robust. Many retail spaces remain underutilized or have been converted to office space. Some of the retail energy has shifted eastward toward Gallery Place, with many of the blocks around Metro Center now perceived as an office district rather than the region’s premier shopping area. The renovation of Hecht’s and the opening of new retailers like H&amp;amp;M (in the former Woodward and Lothrop Department Store) have been positive signs. On the other hand, the Shops at National Place—designed to revitalize Downtown shopping in the 1980s—has been converted to non-destination retail use. Downtown workers still have limited shopping options, and potential tourist and visitor spending is still being lost. In addition, with only one major department store, Downtown Washington does not offer the range and quality of goods to be expected in a major city’s downtown, much less the capital of the United States. 1711.3 [PULLQUOTE: With only one major department store, Downtown Washington does not offer the range and quality of goods to be expected in a major city’s downtown, much less the capital of the United States.] The retail core of the city must be strengthened in the coming years. Retail “leakage” or loss of sales has been estimated to be as high as $1.2 billion per year (or approximately $70 million in 2005 Retail 381 strategies should build off the success of nearby Gallery Place and the Verizon Center, increasing the synergy between these areas and the historic F Street shopping district. The old Convention Center site offers an opportunity to improve the connection between the two areas and create an expanded Central Washington shopping district for the region. New boutique department stores, major national retailers, and smaller independent specialty shops should be strongly encouraged as redevelopment plans for the old Convention Center site proceed. 1711.4 Including ground level retail space within new and renovated office space in the Metro Center area can also help create the critical mass necessary to make Central Washington a more vibrant shopping hub. Strategies to address parking needs, improve public transit links, and create a more comfortable and attractive street environment can support the goal of increasing the area’s prominence as a retail center. 1711.5 Policy CW-2.1.1: Strengthening the Retail Core Strengthen the traditional retail core along F and G Streets between 9th and 15th Street NW. Encourage the extension of the retail core eastward to 6th Street NW to create greater synergy between this area and Gallery Place. Large scale retail and entertainment uses should continue to be strongly encouraged as buildings in the Downtown Retail Core are adaptively reused, and as new infill development takes place. 1711.6 Policy CW-2.1.2: Promoting Central Washington Shopping Facilitate District and private sector efforts to market the Central Washington Retail Core as a shopping destination for District residents as well as for tourists and suburban residents, and to promote Central Washington as a preferred alternative to suburban shopping malls. Retail strategies for this area should AREA ELEM ENTS COMPREHENSIVE PLAN DISTRICT ELEMENTS ADOPTED 12/19/06 P. 2-44 be structured to avoid damaging the successful and strong regional retail economies in Georgetown and Friendship Heights. 1711.7 Policy CW-2.1.3: Creating a Critical Mass of Retail Choices Improve Downtown’s viability as a shopping destination by encouraging additional small retailers to locate around existing retail anchors, adding new major retail anchors, and requiring continuous ground floor retail space wherever appropriate. Encourage the greatest possible variety of goods, services, and pricing so that the Retail Core meets the needs of a diverse range of residents, employees, and visitors. 1711.8 [Photo Caption: Illustrative Rendering of Possible Old Convention Center Site Reuse (2004)] Policy CW-2.1.4: Establishing a Unique Identity for Downtown Shopping Enhance the identity of the Downtown Retail Core as a unique shopping area. Design attention should be focused on the lower levels of buildings, with at grade retail frontages and frequent street-level store entrances. Special features such as canopies, signs, and lighting should be used to create a vibrant shopping environment. Streetscape and landscape design, street lighting, and signage should contribute to the area’s unique sense of place. 1711.9 382 Policy CW-2.1.5: Pedestrian Movement in the Retail Core Emphasize and encourage pedestrian movement in the Downtown Retail Core, particularly along F, G, and H Streets NW. Future development in this area should create and support street-level activity. Interior or underground pedestrian arcades or passageways should be discouraged. 1711.10 Policy CW-2.1.6: Connections to Adjacent Areas Improve pedestrian connections within the Downtown Retail Core, with a particular emphasis on improving the north-south connections along 6th, 8th, 9th, 10th, 11th, 12th, and 13th Streets NW to better connect the area to the Federal Triangle and National Mall on the south and the Convention Center and Franklin Square areas on the north. Use strategies such as improved signage and streetscape design to draw visitors from the National Mall. 1711.11 Policy CW-2.1.7: Complementary Activities Encourage new activities in the Downtown Retail Core that complement and support its primary function as a shopping district, including hotels, restaurants, and entertainment activities. 1711.12 Policy CW-2.1.8: Parking in the Retail Core Encourage the provision of sufficient parking and loading areas in and adjacent to the Downtown Retail Core, with an emphasis on short term parking for shoppers. Wherever feasible, access to parking should be from E and H Streets NW and from the north south streets, rather than from F and G Streets NW. 1711.13 Policy CW-2.1.9: Old Convention Center Redevelopment Support the redevelopment of the Old Washington Convention Center as a mixed use development with residential, office, institutional, community, open space, and recreational uses. Promote the site as a regional retail destination that links Gallery Place to the traditional Retail Core. The reuse plan should include restoration of the I Street and 10th Street rights of way and the Reservation 174 “triangle”, and should be oriented around a major new civic plaza. 1711.14 Action CW-2.1-A: Downtown Retail District Streetscape Planning Review land use, zoning, and urban design regulations for the Downtown retail district to ensure that they are producing the desired results, including continuous ground floor retail space, pedestrian-friendly AREA ELEM ENTS COMPREHENSIVE PLAN DISTRICT ELEMENTS ADOPTED 12/19/06 P. 2-45 streetscapes, adaptive reuse of historic buildings, and increased patronage by visitors and workers. 1711.15 Action CW-2.1-B: Retail Revitalization Programs Continue to use retail revitalization programs such as tax increment financing, grants and loans for façade improvements, and small business development loans to boost Downtown retail development. Periodically assess whether programs are achieving desired outcomes. 1711.16 CW-2.2 Gallery Place Penn Quarter 1712 This Policy Focus area is located east of Metro Center and the Retail Core. It is roughly bounded by 9th Street NW on the west, 5th Street NW on the east, Pennsylvania Avenue NW on the south, and I Street NW on the north. The area includes the Gallery Place-Chinatown Metrorail station and the Archives- Navy Memorial Metrorail station. Its character is more diverse than the Metro Center area, with a large number of housing units, galleries, theaters, museums, and hospitality uses as well as offices and retail shops. 1712.1 The Gallery Place and Penn Quarter area has made an astounding comeback in the last ten years. 383 Since opening in 1997, the 20,000 seat Verizon Center (formerly the MCI Center) has brought millions of sports and concert patrons to the area. The arena has brought about a boom in restaurants, bars, night clubs, and entertainment-oriented retailing. The opening of the 250,000 square foot Gallery Place mixed use complex in 2005 has further boosted the area’s reputation as the center of Washington’s night- life and entertainment scene. 1712.2 At the same time, the opening of the International Spy Museum in 2002, the reopening of the National Portrait Gallery/ Smithsonian Museum of American Art in 2006, the soon-to-open Newseum, and the presence of major art galleries and theaters has made the area the city’s preeminent center for arts and culture. The Woolly Mammoth Theater, E Street Cinemas, and expanded Shakespeare Theater are bringing additional evening foot-traffic to the area, and further supporting the restaurant and gallery scene. 1712.3 [PULLQUOTE: The opening of the International Spy Museum in 2002, the re-opening of the National Portrait Gallery in 2006, the soon-to-open Newseum, and the presence of major art galleries and theaters has made the area the city’s preeminent center for arts and culture.] The area is also Downtown’s premier residential neighborhood. Penn Quarter buildings like the Lansburgh and the Pennsylvania have become some of the city’s most desirable addresses. 1712.4 The continued development of this area as an arts and entertainment district should be supported. As thousands of new housing units come on line in Mount Vernon Triangle and along Massachusetts Avenue, the area’s resident customer base will expand. Its location as the city’s top location for arts and entertainment should be sustained by encouraging additional venues, providing new amenities, and strengthening connections to the National Mall, Retail Core, and emerging Mount Vernon District. 1712.5 [Photo Caption: 7th Street NW shopping] Policy CW-2.2.1: Art and Entertainment District Promote the development of the Gallery Place and 7th Street area as a pedestrian-oriented arts and entertainment district, with nightlife and restaurants, theaters, galleries, and independent and national retailers. Continuous ground floor retail, arts, and entertainment uses should be encouraged along 7th Street between Mount Vernon Square and Pennsylvania Avenue. 1712.6 AREA ELEM ENTS COMPREHENSIVE PLAN DISTRICT ELEMENTS ADOPTED 12/19/06 P. 2-46 Policy CW-2.2.2: East End Theater District Promote the area bounded by 6th Street, 14th Street, F Street, and Pennsylvania Avenue as an internationally recognized theater district, capitalizing on the presence of existing theaters like the National, Warner, Ford’s, Woolly Mammoth, and the Shakespeare’s Lansburgh Theater and new theaters such as the Sidney Harmon Center and the Washington Stage Guild. Marketing, promotion, signage, and special programs should be used to “brand” the area as the region’s top performing arts center. Complementary evening uses such as restaurants should be encouraged in this area. 1712.7 See also the Economic Development Element and the Arts and Culture Element for policies relating to promotion of the arts, tourism and hospitality industries, including the development of a cultural corridor between Union Station and the White House. Policy CW-2.2.3: Penn Quarter Neighborhood Continue to develop the Penn Quarter as a mixed use urban neighborhood. Residential uses should be complemented by additional arts, cultural, retail, and office use, as well as open space. 1712.8 Policy CW-2.2.4: Urban Design in the Arts and Entertainment District Retain and adaptively reuse historic buildings within the Penn Quarter/Gallery Place area. The area’s historic features are an essential part of the Quarter’s success and ambiance as an arts district and must be preserved. New construction in the area should respect the historically low scale building features 384 along 7th Street, stepping down as appropriate to protect the scale and context of important historic buildings. 1712.9 See also Urban Design and Historic Preservation Elements for additional policies relating to historic resources and design. Policy CW-2.2.5: Links to Adjacent Areas Improve the linkages from the Gallery Place/ Penn Quarter area to the National Mall on the south, the Retail Core on the west, and the Mount Vernon Square and Triangle area on the north. The north- south linkages along 7th, 8th, and 9th Streets are particularly important. Given the low traffic volumes along 8th Street NW between F Street and Pennsylvania Avenue, the street’s role as a pedestrian-oriented space linking the National Archives and National Portrait Gallery should be emphasized. Its potential as a large, flexible, programmable open space should be recognized. 1712.10 Action CW-2.2-A: Gallery Place/ Penn Quarter Streetscape Improvements Prepare streetscape improvement plans for Seventh, Eighth, and Ninth Streets NW that physically reinforce the desired character of the area as the city’s “Arts Walk” and provide space for performance, street theater, public art and exhibitions, and other activities that reinforce its role as an entertainment district. Streetscape improvements should be consistent with the approved Pennsylvania Avenue Development Corporation (PADC) Plan for this area. 1712.11 [Photo Caption: Penn Quarter Housing] AREA ELEM ENTS COMPREHENSIVE PLAN DISTRICT ELEMENTS ADOPTED 12/19/06 P. 2-47 CW-2.3 Chinatown 1713 The distinctive “Friendship Arch” at the intersection of 7th and H Streets NW is the center of Washington’s Chinatown. Decorative metal lattice work and railings, Chinese signs, and Chinese façade and roof details greet visitors to the blocks of H Street between 5th Street and 8th Street NW. The area has been a center of Chinese culture since the 1930s, when the city’s original Chinatown along Pennsylvania Avenue was displaced by development of the Federal Triangle. 1713.1 Today, Chinatown is struggling to retain its identity as the area around it booms with new retail, office, entertainment, and housing development. The Chinese population in the area now numbers fewer than 600 residents, and many of the Chinese businesses are having a difficult time keeping pace with rising rents and land costs. National chains have moved in, leading to curious street scenes as businesses like Hooters and Starbucks display signs with Chinese characters. 1713.2 Keeping Chinatown a viable ethnic commercial district and neighborhood will require proactive measures to assist its businesses, attract new Chinese enterprises and cultural activities to the area, and support the institutions and services that sustain the Chinese community today. The area can capitalize on its proximity to the Convention Center and Gallery Place without losing its special character. Although the Chinese population in the neighborhood itself is small, it serves as a cultural and symbolic hub for a metropolitan area with almost 100,000 Chinese-American residents. It is also a destination for tourists (including visitors from Asia) and most recently, the home of the new Chinese community cultural center at Gallery Place. 1713.3 Policy CW-2.3.1: Sustaining Chinatown Retain and enhance Chinatown as a thriving Downtown community including housing, community 385 and cultural facilities, ethnically-oriented street-level retail, related wholesale operations, office and professional uses, and hotels. 1713.4 Policy CW-2.3.1: Protection Chinatown as a Viable Community Protect and conserve Chinatown, not only through Chinese-themed building facades and street signs, but by supporting the cultural traditions of the local Chinese community, assisting Chinese-owned businesses within Chinatown, sustaining the social services that serve the Chinese population, and attracting new activities which expand the area’s role as a regional center for Chinese culture and education. 1713.5 Policy CW-2.3.3: Chinatown’s Architectural Character Support architectural, streetscape, and landscape design criteria for new and renovated buildings that reinforce the identity of Chinatown as a special cultural district. These criteria should provide for the use of Chinese design features in a way that does not harm the historic character or structural integrity of Chinatown’s landmark buildings. 1713.6 Policy CW-2.3.4: Chinatown Wholesaling Support the retention of small food wholesalers and other small non-retail businesses that contribute to the success of Chinatown and help sustain its economic vitality. 1713.7 Policy CW-2.3.5: Chinatown as a Destination Continue to enhance Chinatown’s role as a destination for residents and workers from the District and surrounding jurisdictions, as well as for leisure and business visitors. This can help strengthen the vitality of Chinese-owned businesses, and support the development of new enterprises. Focus in particular on pedestrian connections along 7th Street between H Street NW and the Convention Center. 1713.8 [Photo Caption: Friendship Arch] AREA ELEM ENTS COMPREHENSIVE PLAN DISTRICT ELEMENTS ADOPTED 12/19/06 P. 2-48 Action CW-2.3.A: Chinatown Design Review Continue to implement design review procedures that support the authentic expression of Chinese culture in new and rehabilitated development, including, as appropriate, building design, signage, streetscape and open space criteria. Periodically review the procedures and update them as necessary. 1713.9 Action CW-2.3.B: Chinatown Best Practices Study Conduct a “best practices” study that analyzes what other cities have done to conserve ethnic business districts (particularly central city “Chinatowns” through land use and urban design decisions, regulatory controls, business development and economic assistance, and tourist promotion. 1713.10 Action CW-2.3.C: Chinese Park at 5th Street and Massachusetts Avenue Support redesign of the park reservation at 5th Street NW and Massachusetts Avenue NW with a Chinese landscape theme, providing a symbolic gateway to Chinatown from Massachusetts Avenue NW. 1713.11 CW-2.4 Mount Vernon District 1714 The Mount Vernon District includes the blocks adjacent to and including historic Mount Vernon Square and the newly developing Mount Vernon Triangle area on its east. Located at the crossroads of New York and Massachusetts Avenues, the Mount Vernon District provides a transition between the lowerscale residences of Shaw on the north and the high-density commercial areas of Downtown on the south. The area suffered from disinvestment and blight during the late 20th Century. Much of its building stock was abandoned or demolished, and large areas were converted to parking or became vacant. The area 386 has undergone a turnaround since 2000 and is currently one of the city’s most active development areas. 1714.1 Mount Vernon Square itself was designed to be a focal point in Washington’s ensemble of great civic landmarks. Its focus is the 1902 former Carnegie Library building, an elegant historic structure that is now in use by the Washington Historical Society. Facing the north edge of the Square is the 2.3 million square foot Washington Convention Center, completed in 2003. To the southwest, the now vacant site of the former Convention Center is awaiting redevelopment. Immediately northwest of the Square, a major convention hotel is planned. Large-scale office buildings occupy other sides of the Square, framing it as a potentially great public space. 1714.2 In 2004, the Office of Planning prepared a design workbook for Mount Vernon Square to enhance the Square’s identity as the heart of a new urban neighborhood. The workbook explored alternatives to make the Square more accessible to pedestrians, more active and animated, and more visually dramatic. Its recommendations include enhancing the L’Enfant Plan “bow-tie” parks along Massachusetts and New York Avenues, improving access to the square, using placards to formalize the identity of Mount Vernon Square as an urban center, and re-inventing the Square itself as a 21st Century landmark. 1714.3 [PULLQUOTE: In 2004, the Office of Planning prepared a design workbook for Mount Vernon Square to enhance the Square’s identity as the heart of a new urban neighborhood. The workbook explored alternatives to make the Square more accessible to pedestrians, more active and animated, and more visually dramatic.] East of Mount Vernon Square, the 30-acre Mount Vernon Triangle is bordered by Massachusetts Avenue, New Jersey Avenue, and New York Avenue. An “Action Agenda” for this area was developed in 2003 to guide its transformation to a new mixed use neighborhood. Since that time, projects like Sovereign Square, the Meridian, and 555 Massachusetts have redefined the area and generated momentum for AREA ELEM ENTS COMPREHENSIVE PLAN DISTRICT ELEMENTS ADOPTED 12/19/06 P. 2-49 additional development on the remaining vacant sites. A 55,000 square foot grocery store and more than 600 housing units are currently under construction in the City Vista project at 5th and I Streets NW, and more than 1,000 more new units are in the construction or planning stages nearby. A limited number of office buildings are also planned, but the emphasis is on housing with supporting retail and cultural uses. 1714.4 The Mount Vernon District provides an important opportunity to draw residents from outside the city as well as to attract residents looking for a unique urban experience not available in other Washington neighborhoods. The expected population growth will require the improvement of public facilities, parks, streets, transit, infrastructure, and community services. It will require ongoing planning to protect historic resources, respect the fabric of adjacent communities, and ensure that new uses are compatible with and connected to their surroundings. As Mount Vernon Triangle and Mount Vernon Square evolve into Downtown’s newest neighborhood, coordinated public and private investment will be needed to create 387 economic value, and to ensure that a quality environment for new residents, workers and visitors is created. 1714.5 Policy CW-2.4.1: Re-envisioning Mount Vernon Square Improve Mount Vernon Square as a center of cultural activity, a memorable civic landmark, and a crossroads between Downtown on the south and the historic Shaw neighborhood on the north. The Square’s function should be reinforced by encouraging active ground floor uses and prominent entries on the blocks that front it, and promoting high quality architecture and streetscape design on its perimeter. Redesign of the Square itself should be explored, retaining it is as an important civic open space but modifying pathways, landscapes, paving patterns, street furniture, lighting, and access points to make it more usable and inviting. 1714.6 Policy CW-2.4.2: Emphasizing the Avenues and Visual Axes Emphasize and reinforce the historic elements of the L’Enfant Plan in the planning and design of the Mount Vernon District. This should include the creation of more dramatic and well-lit gateways along Massachusetts and New York Avenues, capitalizing on the 8th Street NW view corridor (mitigating the effects of the TechWorld “bridge” creating a park-like promenade along the K Street axis (on both sides of the Square and reinforcing the continuity of 7th and 9th Streets as access points to the Square. 1714.7 [Photo Caption: View corridor from Mt. Vernon Square south to National Portrait Gallery] Policy CW-2.4.3: Convention Center Area Land Uses Encourage land uses around Mount Vernon Square which capitalize on the presence of the Washington Convention Center. Such uses include hotels, restaurants, retail, and entertainment uses. Conventionrelated hotel construction should be focused on vacant or underutilized land immediately adjacent to the Convention Center to minimize impacts on the surrounding neighborhood. 1714.8 Policy CW-2.4.4: Mount Vernon Triangle Residential Development Develop the Mount Vernon Triangle (east of Mount Vernon Square) as a high-density residential neighborhood. Zoning incentives for this area should encourage the production of housing, as well as local-serving ground floor retail, arts, and small office uses. Public and private sector improvements to parking, infrastructure, transit, and other community services and facilities should be provided as development takes place. 1714.9 Policy CW-2.4.5: Creating a Sense of Community in Mount Vernon Triangle Foster a stronger sense of community in Mount Vernon Triangle by including affordable housing as well as market rate housing, providing family-oriented amenities such as larger housing units and parks, encouraging small-scale cultural uses and small businesses, and preserving historic landmarks within the AREA ELEM ENTS COMPREHENSIVE PLAN DISTRICT ELEMENTS ADOPTED 12/19/06 P. 2-50 area. The 5th and K Street area should be emphasized as the area’s “neighborhood center” and the 3rd and K Street area should be emphasized as its “residential core.” 1714.10 See also the Near Northwest Area Element, and the Urban Design Element for additional policies regarding development along the edges of Central Washington Policy CW-2.4.6: Mount Vernon District Parks Improve the network of public open spaces in the Mount Vernon Square and Triangle area to meet the needs of residents, workers, and visitors. Special attention should be given to enhancing the “bow- tie” shaped park reservations on Massachusetts and New York Avenues, and providing more active, programmed uses in Mount Vernon Square itself. This will require coordination with the National 388 Park Service and the National Capital Planning Commission. Eventual transfer of park management responsibilities to the District should be pursued for these spaces. 1714.11 Policy CW-2.4.7: Creating Pedestrian-Oriented Streets in the Mount Vernon District Promote active, pedestrian-friendly streets throughout the Mount Vernon District. Place a particular emphasis on improving K Streets as a major east-west pedestrian route, with wide sidewalks and abundant street trees and landscaping. Pedestrian amenities should also be provided along 5th, 7th, 8th, and 9th Streets to improve the connections between the Mount Vernon District and the Gallery Place and Chinatown areas to the south. 1714.12 Action CW-2.4-A: Mount Vernon Square Design Vision and Mount Vernon Triangle Action Agenda Implement the recommendations of the Mount Vernon Square Design Workbook and the Mount Vernon Triangle Action Agenda, particularly as they relate to zoning, urban design, streetscape improvements, capital improvements, and development of priority sites. 1714.13 Action CW-2.4-B: Convention Center Hotel Develop a major convention center hotel in close proximity to the Washington Convention Center. The hotel should be sited and designed to complement adjacent uses and add activity and aesthetic value to the Mount Vernon Square neighborhood. 1714.14 Action CW-2.4-C: Parking Management Program Develop and implement parking management programs to protect residential areas from spillover parking associated with the Convention Center, Downtown office and retail growth, and new attractions on the Old Convention Center site and elsewhere on the northern edge of Downtown. 1714.15 [Photo Caption: New housing along Massachusetts Avenue NW] CW-2.5 Downtown East Judiciary Square 1715 The Downtown East Judiciary Square Focus Area is roughly bounded by Massachusetts Avenue NW on the north, North Capitol Street and Louisiana Avenue NW on the east, Pennsylvania Avenue on the south, and 5th Street NW on the west. The area is dominated by government and institutional uses, including the US Department of Labor, General Accounting Office, and Federal Courthouse; the District Municipal Building and Superior Court; Georgetown Law School; and the National Building Museum. The area also includes new housing development along Massachusetts Avenue, private office buildings like the award-winning National Association of Realtors building, and several large hotels. 1751.1 The Downtown East/ Judiciary Square area currently suffers from a weak sense of identity—even its hotels are advertised as being on Capitol Hill rather than Downtown. East-west circulation is interrupted by I-395, which effectively carves a wide channel through the area between 2nd and 3rd Streets NW. AREA ELEM ENTS COMPREHENSIVE PLAN DISTRICT ELEMENTS ADOPTED 12/19/06 P. 2-51 Massive government buildings further block circulation and in some instances obstruct historic sight lines. The area also contains a large number of parking lots, curb cuts, and buildings that are devoid of ground level activity. 1715.2 Downtown East has the potential to be much more than it is today. It could be much better integrated with the booming Gallery Place/ Penn Quarter area on its west, the emerging Mount Vernon Triangle and NoMA neighborhoods on its north, and the Capitol complex and Union Station area on its east. The area 389 is substantially larger than Gallery Place/ Penn Quarter but lacks its animated quality, fine-grain architecture, and active street life. Key to its future success is the development of the air rights over I- 395, the restoration of E and F Streets NW as east-west through streets. The improvement of Judiciary Square as a great public space also should be encouraged to create a stronger focal point for the area. Mixed use infill development should be strongly encouraged throughout Downtown East. The design of new buildings in this area should be less monolithic than they have has been in the past, with active ground floor uses and more varied facades. 1715.3 [PULLQUOTE: Downtown East has the potential to be much more than it is today. It could be much better integrated with the booming Gallery Place/ Penn Quarter area on its west, the emerging Mount Vernon Triangle and NoMA neighborhoods on its north, and the Capitol complex and Union Station area on its east.] Policy CW-2.5.1: Judiciary Square Improvements Maintain the primary function of the Judiciary Square area as a judicial center, and enhance the area’s appearance as a great pedestrian-oriented civic space with a strong sense of identity. Consistent with the 2005 Master Plan for the site, buildings in the area should be better related to one another and to the Square itself. 1715.4 Policy CW-2.5.2: Judiciary Square Parking Relocation Pursue the long-term relocation of surface parking lots south of Judiciary Square (on E Street) and east of the Square (along 4th Street) to underground garages as a way to improve aesthetics, enhance the Square’s role as a formal open space, and provide a green connection to the National Mall. Consider special paving, traffic and parking restrictions, and other design changes on F Street NW to improve connectivity between the National Building Museum and the Square. 1715.5 Policy CW-2.5.3: Connecting Judiciary Square to Gallery Place/ Penn Quarter Improve pedestrian connections between Judiciary Square and the Gallery Place/ Penn Quarter area by encouraging active ground floor uses along E and F Streets NW, improving signage, upgrading surface transit, and supporting compatible infill development. 1715.6 [Photo Caption: National Building Museum] Policy CW-2.5.4: Enhancing the Identity of “Downtown East” Strengthen Downtown East as a geographically distinct mixed use area of hotel, commercial, retail, and residential development, taking advantage of its strategic location between Capitol Hill, Downtown, and Union Station. Undertake streetscape improvements, well-designed infill development, and branding and marketing strategies to give the area a stronger identity and sense of place. 1715.7 Policy CW-2.5.5: Using the Avenues as a Design Framework Take advantage of the L’Enfant Plan avenues that cross Downtown East, including New Jersey, Massachusetts and Louisiana Avenues NW, and North Capitol Street to create a framework for the area’s future development. The avenues should be enhanced as pedestrian-friendly streets, with buildings designed to frame important views and landmarks. 1715.8 AREA ELEM ENTS COMPREHENSIVE PLAN DISTRICT ELEMENTS ADOPTED 12/19/06 P. 2-52 Policy CW-2.5.6: I-395 Air Rights Development Pursue development of the air rights over I-395 between E Street NW and Massachusetts Avenue NW, including the restoration of the street rights-of-way along F and G Streets. Mixed land uses, including housing, offices, ground floor retail, and parkland, should be encouraged in this area. Air rights 390 development should be sensitive to adjacent areas and should preserve important views. 1715.9 Action CW-2.5-A: Downtown East Design Plans Conduct more detailed urban design planning for the Downtown East areas similar to the plans completed for the Mount Vernon Square and Mount Vernon Triangle areas. 1715.10 Action CW-2.5-B: Judiciary Square Transportation Improvements Implement the recommendations of the 2004 DDOT Judiciary Square Transportation and Security Study, including the narrowing of E Street and Indiana Avenue, restoration of two-way traffic on C Street, provision of new bus stops and bicycle amenities, and better organization of parking to reduce conflicts in the area. 1715.11 CW-2.6 Golden Triangle/ K Street 1716 The Golden Triangle/ K Street Policy Focus Area includes the Golden Triangle Business Improvement District and the area to the east around Franklin Square. The area is roughly bounded by Massachusetts Avenue on the north, New Hampshire Avenue on the west, and Pennsylvania (west of the White House) and New York Avenues (east of the White House) on the south. 1716.1 This is the largest concentration of office space in Central Washington, encompassing more than 60 square blocks almost completely developed with office buildings. The area also includes complementary land uses that support the office market, such as hotels, retail stores and restaurants. It also contains important open spaces such as Farragut and McPherson Squares. Golden Triangle/ K Street shares its southern edge with major institutional and federal neighbors, including the White House, the Corcoran Gallery, and the Executive Office Building. The area around 19th and G Streets NW has emerged as the District’s international financial center, with global banking and monetary institutions like the IMF and World Bank.1716.2 On the eastern side of this Focus Area, Lower 16th Street has a unique and historic character that sets it apart from the area around it. The five blocks between H Street NW and Scott Circle are the ceremonial gateway to the White House and provide significant vistas of the White House and Washington Memorial. The street’s green space and exceptionally wide right-of-way (40 feet between the sidewalks and property lines) are a defining element of its character. In addition, the corridor includes notable architecture and a mix of uses, including high-density housing. It is currently under consideration for historic district designation. 1716.3 The Golden Triangle/ K Street area was Central Washington’s major development area from 1950 through the early 1980s. Today, the area is almost completely built out and almost no vacant land remains. Some of the area’s buildings are likely to be replaced or overhauled during the coming years, however. This is especially true for its 1950s and 1960s vintage office buildings, many of which lack modern “Class A” amenities. As infill and renovation take place, there will be opportunities to introduce new uses such as housing, and to improve architectural quality and street-level activity. 1716.4 Because the area has been so heavily dominated by a single use (office) in the past, its streets are often empty at night and on the weekends. The lack of residents forces many of the retailers to limit hours of operation. The area’s architecture is also repetitive, with many buildings almost identical in height and AREA ELEM ENTS COMPREHENSIVE PLAN DISTRICT ELEMENTS ADOPTED 12/19/06 P. 2-53 391 width and similar in exterior design. This should change in the future, as the area takes on a more mixed use character and high-quality architecture becomes more valued as an amenity. 1716.5 Over the next 20 years, housing and retail uses should be considered in this area to balance the office concentration and create after-hours street life. The area has some of the best transit access in the city, with four Metrorail stations. A proposed redesign of K Street to create an exclusive busway will improve connectivity between this area and the rest of Downtown, as well as the emerging Mount Vernon District and NoMA area. 1716.6 [PULLQUOTE: Over the next 20 years, housing and retail uses should be considered in this area to balance the office concentration and create after-hours street life.

Continue to develop programs to meet the transportation needs of the local workforce, manage congestion on area streets, address security needs, and improve access for transit users, pedestrians, and bicyclists. 1716.7 Policy CW-2.6.2: Diversification of Land Use Encourage the gradual diversification of land uses in Golden Triangle, capitalizing on opportunities for housing and ground floor retail use as the aging building stock is replaced. 1716.8 Policy CW-2.6.3: Golden Triangle/ K Street Amenities Retain and enhance the unique characteristics of the Golden Triangle/ K Street area. Specifically, Franklin Square, McPherson Square, and Farragut Square parks, should be retained as attractive, high quality open spaces, with programmed activities that encourage their use and enjoyment. Historic buildings throughout the area should be restored, protected, and adaptively reused. As the area is renovated and older buildings are refurbished and replaced, the streetscape and public realm also should be improved. 1716.9 Policy CW-2.6.4: Connecticut Avenue Corridor Support the continued concentration of active ground-floor retail uses along the Connecticut Avenue corridor between K Street and Dupont Circle. 1716.10 [Photo Caption: World Bank at 18th and H Streets NW] Policy CW-2.6.5: East-West Circulation Improvements Improve east-west circulation through the Golden Triangle to better connect the area to the Retail Core, Gallery Place, and Mount Vernon areas on the east, and the West End and Georgetown business districts on the west. These improvements should reinforce K Street’s role as the area’s “Main Street.” 1716.11 Policy CW-2.6.6: Lower 16th Street Protect and enhance the special character of Lower 16th Street NW between H Street and Scott Circle. The street’s historic, ceremonial role as the approach to the White House and Lafayette Park should be recognized and conserved. Future development shall be compatible with the street’s established architectural character and scale. Uses and activities that are appropriate to maintain the street’s appearance and historic significance, particularly its open space and greenery, should be encouraged. 1716.12 AREA ELEM ENTS COMPREHENSIVE PLAN DISTRICT ELEMENTS ADOPTED 12/19/06 P. 2-54 Action CW-2.6-A: K Street Busway Implement the K Street Busway project, including exclusive bus lanes from 9th Street to 22nd Street 392 NW. 1716.13 CW-2.7 L’Enfant Plaza/ Near Southwest 1717 The L’Enfant Plaza/ Near Southwest Policy Focus Area is bounded by 15th Street NW on the west, 2nd Street NW on the East, Independence Avenue on the north, and I-395 on the south. The area includes a mix of private commercial development and numerous federal office buildings, including the U.S. Departments of Agriculture, Energy, Education, and Housing and Urban Development. With a workforce of 65,000 employees, the Near Southwest is one of the major employment hubs of Central Washington. 1717.1 The Near Southwest reflects the Modernist design philosophies of the 1950s and 1960s. Although some of its buildings were constructed in the late 1930s, the area’s character was largely defined by the urban renewal projects of the post-war era. Many of its mid-century buildings are set back from the street by vast plazas and are accessed by raised roadways like the 10th Street promenade. The vision for the area as a coherent set of futuristic buildings was never realized, and today the area has a disjoined quality. 1717.2 In addition, Near Southwest’s former role as a federal industrial district is evident in a number of places. Elevated railroad tracks bisect the area, and there are still active heating plants, warehouses, and even quasi-manufacturing activities like the Bureau of Printing and Engraving. Navigating the area on foot can be confusing and the relationships between buildings, streets, and the area’s larger context is often unclear. 1717.3 Some of the Near Southwest’s private complexes, including the Portals and L’Enfant Plaza, are zoned in a way that allows additional development on their plazas and open spaces. Design measures are needed to guide this development so that it can help resolve the harsh pedestrian conditions within the area and humanize the streetscape. Streetscape improvements are also needed to better connect the Near Southwest with the Southwest Waterfront (via the Banneker Overlook at the end of 10th Street and the National Mall. Planning for the area should be done collaboratively with the National Capital Planning Commission (NCPC which has jurisdiction over much of this area. NCPC’s Urban Design and Security Plan contained extensive recommendations for improving circulation and streetscape in this area while also addressing security concerns for major federal tenants. In addition, the area will be addressed by NCPC in its National Capital Framework Plan.1717.4 Policy CW-2.7.1: Enhancing the Near Southwest Work collaboratively with the National Capital Planning Commission to improve the aesthetic quality, identity, and pedestrian character of the Near Southwest. Plans for the area should identify streetscape and signage improvements, pedestrian circulation changes, measures to mitigate the scale of the area’s monolithic buildings, and guidelines for new (or replacement) buildings within the area. 1717.5 Policy CW-2.7.2: 10th Street Promenade and Banneker Overlook Enhance 10th St SW as a major point of access between the National Mall, L’Enfant Plaza, and the Southwest Waterfront. Encourage a nationally significant cultural attraction at Banneker Overlook that provides a clear connection between the Near Southwest, the Washington Channel, and East Potomac Park. Planning for this area should be coordinated with DDOT’s plans to develop an intermodal 393 transportation center in the vicinity. 1717.6 AREA ELEM ENTS COMPREHENSIVE PLAN DISTRICT ELEMENTS ADOPTED 12/19/06 P. 2-55 [PULLQUOTE: Enhance 10th St SW as a major point of access between the National Mall, L’Enfant Plaza, and the Southwest Waterfront.

These plans should consider the build out potential of the area’s urban renewal sites. They should also consider the need for zoning changes, design guidelines, or other measures that encourage the development of nationally important destinations while limiting overdevelopment of existing open spaces and plazas. 1717.8 CW-2.8 NoMA and Northwest One 1718 The North of Massachusetts Avenue (NoMA) and Northwest One Policy Focus Area includes the area roughly bounded by New Jersey Avenue on the west, Massachusetts Avenue on the south, New York Avenue on the north, and 2nd and 3rd Streets NE on the east. This 350-acre area includes the Union Station and New York Avenue Metrorail stations. 1718.1 For much of the past century, NoMA has been an industrial and warehousing area and a “back office” district supplementing Downtown. Its proximity to the CSX railroad and the established concentration of industry along New York Avenue attracted light manufacturers, wholesalers, and distributors throughout the mid to late 1900s. During the 1990s, the area was viewed as the city’s best prospect for hightechnology uses and plans were developed to attract new media and biotech enterprises, as well as “telecom hotels,” to the area. 1718.2 NoMA’s proximity to the U.S. Capitol has also made it a desirable location for government office space. During the 1980s and 1990s, office development moved steadily northward along North Capitol Street and by 2000 was also moving eastward toward Capitol Hill. This trend accelerated after 2000 with the opening of Metrorail’s first “infill” station at New York Avenue, the renovation of a historic printing plant in Eckington as the new headquarters of XM Satellite Radio, the leasing of more than one million square feet at Station Place (1st and F Streets NE) to the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, and the development of a new headquarters facility for the Bureau of Alcohol Tobacco and Firearms at 1st Street NE and New York Avenue. 1718.3 Large areas of NoMA remain vacant or underutilized today—although that is rapidly changing. The strong demand for Downtown housing has shifted the vision for NoMA’s future, and it is now regarded as an exceptional site for future mixed use development, rather than just technology and back office uses. While the area is far from a blank canvass, its parking lots, open storage yards, and vacant sites 394 present the opportunity for thousands of new homes, millions of square feet of office space, and great new parks and public buildings. Much of the land in NoMA has been acquired by investors during the last ten years, and concept plans are pending on many of its 50 or so blocks. 1718.4 [PULLQUOTE: While the area is far from a blank canvass, its parking lots, open storage yards, and vacant sites present the opportunity for thousands of new homes, millions of square feet of office space, and great new parks and public buildings.] AREA ELEM ENTS COMPREHENSIVE PLAN DISTRICT ELEMENTS ADOPTED 12/19/06 P. 2-56 Given the extraordinary level of development interest, it is important that measures be taken to coordinate development and address the need for infrastructure, street improvements, landscaping, parks, and other public necessities in the area. There is also an urgent need for design guidelines and standards to ensure that the area develops in an attractive and cohesive manner, create a pedestrian-friendly and vibrant street environment, and provide appropriate transitions to less dense development areas nearby. 1718.5 Planning for NoMA must also accommodate established uses. The area includes important historic buildings like the Government Printing Office and the U-Line Arena. It also includes active light manufacturing and wholesale uses north of Florida Avenue and east of the CSX tracks. These uses should not be driven out by rising land values and speculation, but should be retained and ultimately assisted in relocating to suitable sites elsewhere in the city when market conditions support a change in land use. 1718.6 The District is currently completing a Vision Plan and Development Strategy for NoMA to establish more detailed policies for the area. The Draft Strategy envisions an area of high-density commercial and mixed use development between North Capitol Street and the CSX railroad tracks, and a less intense and primarily residential area east of the tracks, stepping down to the moderate density residential areas of Capitol Hill. A similar transition is envisioned on the north, with vacant land and industrial uses north of Florida Avenue and west of the railroad gradually giving way to housing over the next 20 years. The strategy also envisions air rights development over the CSX tracks (adjacent to the H Street overpass helping bridge the railroad barrier and support the revival of the H Street commercial district to the east. 1718.7 West of NoMA, the Northwest One neighborhood is roughly bordered by North Capitol and K Streets, and New Jersey and New York Avenues. The area includes several subsidized housing developments, including Sursum Corda Cooperative, Temple Court Apartments, Tyler House, Sibley Plaza, and Golden Rule Center. More than 35 percent of the area’s 2,000 residents live below the federal poverty line, and the area has suffered from high crime and distressed housing for years. In 2004, Northwest One was selected as the pilot site for the city’s New Communities Initiative. Plans are currently underway to rebuild the Sursum Corda Cooperative as a mixed income community, providing one-for-one replacement of subsidized housing while adding market rate housing and new community anchors that help residents become more self-sufficient. 1718.8 395 [PULLQUOTE: Plans are currently underway to rebuild the Sursum Corda Cooperative as a mixed income community, providing one-for-one replacement of subsidized housing while adding market rate housing and new community anchors that help residents become more self-sufficient.] Policy CW-2.8.1: NoMA Land Use Mix Promote NoMA’s development as an active mixed use neighborhood that includes residential, office, hotel, commercial, and ground floor retail uses. A diverse mix of housing, serving a range of household types and incomes, should be accommodated. 1718.9 Policy CW-2.8.2: East of the Tracks and Eckington Place Transition Areas Create a production/arts and live-work, mixed-use area east of the CSX railroad tracks between H Street NE and Florida Avenue NE, and in the area east of Eckington Place and north of New York Avenue. Some of this area is shown as “Mixed Use Production Distribution Repair Residential” areas on the Future Land Use Map. The intent of this designation is not to blend industrial uses with housing, but rather to retain viable industrial activities until market conditions support their conversion to live- work space, housing, artists studios, and similar uses. These two areas should generally not be developed as AREA ELEM ENTS COMPREHENSIVE PLAN DISTRICT ELEMENTS ADOPTED 12/19/06 P. 2-57 large-scale commercial office buildings. Mixed use development, including housing, should be encouraged in both locations. 1718.10 Policy CW-2.8.3: NoMA Transportation Improvements Design NoMA to accommodate a wide array of transportation options, with a particular emphasis on walking, bicycling, and improved transit connections. Improve the accessibility, functionality, and safety of the area’s street grid, introducing new streets as needed to improve circulation through the area. This should include the redesign of the New York/ Florida Avenue intersection to improve pedestrian safety, enhance access to the New York Avenue metro station, and create a landscaped neighborhood gateway, possibly including a new national memorial. 1718.11 Policy CW-2.8.4: Protecting Neighborhoods Abutting NoMA Provide appropriate scale transitions between NoMA and existing adjacent residential neighborhoods in Eckington and Capitol Hill to conserve the fine-grained row house fabric of these communities. Service facilities, loading docks, and other potentially objectionable features should be located away from sensitive uses such as housing. 1718.12 See also the Urban Design Element and the Capitol Hill Area Element for policies on scale transitions Policy CW-2.8.5: NoMA Architectural Design Establish a unique architectural and design identity for NoMA, based in part on the area’s heritage as an industrial area. This identity should preserve, renovate, and adaptively reuse NoMA’s important historic buildings. 1718.13 Action CW-2.8-A: Implement the NoMA Vision Plan Implement the NoMA Vision Plan and Development Strategy, including its recommendations for land use, infrastructure, transportation, environmental improvements, streetscape, open space, identity, and neighborhood quality. 1718.14 See the Mid-City Area Element for a discussion of the proposed Eckington Small Area Plan, including the North Capitol Street area between Florida and New York Avenues. 396 Action CW-2.8-B: NoMA Infrastructure Complete an assessment of infrastructure and utility needs for NoMA and identify the most appropriate means to finance and build needed improvements. 1718.15 Action CW- 2.8-C: Development incentives for NoMA Consider a range of development incentives, including tax-increment financing, payment in lieu of taxes, and tax abatement for preferred development, to achieve the desired land use mix within NoMA. 1718.16 Action CW-2.8-D: Northwest One New Community Redevelop Northwest One as a mixed income community, including new market rate and subsidized housing, a new school and recreation center, a library and health clinic, and neighborhood-serving retail space. Redevelopment of Northwest One should a) Restore the city street grid through Sursum Corda (b) Emphasize K Street NW as a “main street” that connects the area to NoMA and the Mount Vernon District c) Maximize private sector participation. 1718.17 AREA ELEM ENTS COMPREHENSIVE PLAN DISTRICT ELEMENTS ADOPTED 12/19/06 P. 2-58 CHAPTER 17 FAR NORTHEAST AND SOUTHEAST AREA ELEMENT [Citations to be reflowed, starting with Overview, now Sec 1700] Overview 1800 The Far Northeast and Southeast Planning Area encompasses the 8.3 square miles located east of I- 295 and north of Naylor Road SE. Its boundaries are shown in the Map at left. Most of this area has historically been Council Ward 7 although in past decades, parts have been included in Wards 6 and 8. 1800.1 Far Northeast and Southeast is known for its stable, attractive neighborhoods and its diverse mix of housing. It includes single-family communities like Hillcrest, Eastland Gardens, and Penn Branch; row house and semi-detached housing neighborhoods such as Twining, River Terrace, and Fairlawn; and apartment communities like Naylor Gardens, Mayfair Mansions, and Lincoln Heights. The area has an excellent transportation network, including the Minnesota Avenue, Benning Road, and Deanwood Metrorail stations, Interstate 295, and several major avenues linking neighborhoods east of the Anacostia River to Central Washington. The community is home to Fort Dupont Park—one of the largest parks in the city and a center of community life for generations. It includes shopping centers like East of the River Park and Skyland, and small neighborhood commercial districts along Pennsylvania Avenue, Nannie Helen Burroughs Avenue, and other local streets and arterials. 1800.2 Far Northeast and Southeast has always had a strong sense of community spirit, due in part to a well organized network of community associations, churches, and interest groups. These groups include nonprofits like the Marshall Heights Community Development Organization, cultural organizations like the East of the River Community Arts Program, and neighborhood groups such as the Deanwood Citizens Association and the Benning Ridge Civic Association. For years, activities like Minnesota Avenue Day and the Fort Dupont Summer Concert Series have built community pride and entertained residents and visitors. Far Northeast and Southeast also has a historic tradition of being strongly connected to its natural landscape, dating back to its origins as an agricultural community. Small backyard gardens may 397 be found throughout the community today, even in apartment complexes and public housing. 1800.3 The area is not without its challenges. Between 1990 and 2000, Far Northeast and Southeast experienced an 11 percent decline in population, an increase in its poverty rate, and an increase in its percentage of single-mother households. Its crime rate and unemployment rate are both above the city average, and many residents must travel long distances for shopping, education, and basic services. Many middle class families left the neighborhoods of Far Northeast and Southeast during the 1970s, 80s, and 90s, and schools and other community services have suffered as a consequence. 1800.4 These issues must be addressed before the Far Northeast and Southeast community can reach its full potential. And they must be addressed in a way that benefits existing residents as well as new residents who may be attracted to the area by its relatively affordable housing and other amenities. Broader prosperity in Far Northeast and Southeast should not be gained at the expense of those who have helped build and sustain the community for generations. While a high priority will be placed on bringing middle class and working families back to this community, an even higher priority must be placed on improving the quality of life for the individuals and families who live here today. 1800.5 This Planning Area has seen significant change during recent years. More than 1,000 housing units have been constructed since 2000 alone, and many more have been renovated. New developments like Fort Chaplin Woods and Dupont Commons are creating more diverse housing choices and opportunities. At AREA ELEM ENTS COMPREHENSIVE PLAN DISTRICT ELEMENTS ADOPTED 12/19/06 P. 2-59 the same time, demolition of former public housing projects such as East Capitol Dwellings has removed over 1,000 units from the area’s housing stock since 2000, resulting in a net loss of total households in the last five years. 1800.6 Non-residential development in Far Northeast and Southeast has lagged behind the rest of the city. In fact, most of the recent non-residential construction has consisted of reinvestment in public facilities such as schools and recreation centers. This may shift change in the coming years, as new shopping areas are developed at Skyland and East Capitol Gateway, and new businesses and services open along Pennsylvania Avenue SE, Minnesota Avenue, at Kenilworth-Parkside, and elsewhere in the community. 1800.7 [Photo Caption: Far NE/ SE is home to Fort Dupont Park—one of the largest parks in the city and a center of community life for generations.] Context History 1801 Most of Far Northeast and Southeast was still countryside until the early 20th century. In fact, large tracts of land were farmed until as recently as the mid-1900s. Early settlements in the area included the communities of Good Hope (near Alabama Avenue and Naylor Road Benning Heights (near Fort Dupont and Deanwood. 1801.1 Far Northeast and Southeast took on strategic importance during the Civil War, when Fort Dupont, Fort Davis, and other encampments were built to protect the nation’s capital from attack. Woodlawn Cemetery—another local landmark—was established in 1895 to provide a site for African-American burials, which were largely prohibited at other cemeteries in the region at that time. By the late 1800s, Deanwood had emerged as a working class community of black and white families and was known 398 for its self-reliance and strong sense of economic independence. 1801.2 The first large-scale urban development in the area took place during the 1920s. The pace accelerated during World War II, as defense and government workers flocked to the city. Naylor Gardens, for example, was developed for the federal government and later served as cooperative housing for returning war veterans. Rapid development continued through the 1950s, as sewers, paved streets, and sidewalks were provided to most areas. Neighborhoods like Hillcrest (originally called Summit Ridge) and Benning Ridge (originally called Bradbury Heights) date from this period. 1801.3 Following the removal of restrictive housing covenants in the late 1940s, the racial composition of the community shifted. By 1960, a majority of the area’s residents were African-American. The pace of development slowed after 1970, and the community entered a period of population decline as many families left the city for suburban Maryland and elsewhere. Despite the loss of residents, many highquality neighborhoods remain in Far Northeast and Southeast, and today there are signs of reinvestment in nearly all parts of the community. 1801.4 Land Use 1802 Land use statistics for this Planning Area appear in Figure 17.1. Far Northeast and Southeast comprises about 5,300 acres, or about 14 percent of the city’s land area. 1802.1 [INSERT Figure 17.1: Land Use Composition in the Far Northeast and Southeast 1802.5] AREA ELEM ENTS COMPREHENSIVE PLAN DISTRICT ELEMENTS ADOPTED 12/19/06 P. 2-60 [Pie chart “slices” updated to reflect Planning Area boundary changes. Parks/Open Space-25 Residential-35 Comm/Ind-3 Streets-25 Pub/Institutional-4 Rail/Utilities-4%,Vacant-4%.] The area is predominantly a residential community, with more than 35 percent of the land area developed with housing. Densities are typically lower than the citywide average, with much of the housing stock consisting of one- and two-family homes. Concentrations of more dense housing exist in Fairfax Village, Randle Highlands, Benning Ridge, Lincoln Heights, Marshall Heights, Kenilworth-Parkside, and north of Fort Dupont Park. 1802.2 Commercial uses are clustered in nodes along Minnesota Avenue, East Capitol Street, Naylor Road, Pennsylvania Avenue, and Benning Road. The area’s largest commercial centers are located near Minnesota Avenue and Benning Road, and at Skyland on Naylor Road. A small industrial area is located in the northwest corner of the area, parallel to the railroad and Kenilworth Avenue. Industrial uses, including the Pepco Power Plant, are also located north of Benning Road. Together, commercial and industrial uses represent just three percent of the Far Northeast and Southeast’s land area. 1802.3 Open space and parks comprise about 25 percent of the Planning Area. Much of the area’s open space, including the chain of Fort Circle Parks extending from Fort Mahon to Fort Stanton, and the Kenilworth Aquatic Gardens, is under National Park Service ownership. Two of the community’s parks—Watts Branch and Pope Branch—follow natural stream valleys and provide a unique amenity for the community. Public facilities, including local public schools, comprise about 4 percent of the area. Streets and public rights of way comprise 25 percent of the Planning Area. Approximately 180 acres—almost 4 percent of Far Northeast and Southeast—consists of vacant, unimproved land. 1802.4 Demographics 1803 Basic demographic data for Far Northeast and Southeast is shown in Table 18.1. In 2000, the area had a 399 population of 73,800, or about 13 percent of the city’s total. Population in the area has been declining for over 40 years, although the decline was not as rapid in the 1990s as it was in the 1970s and 80s. In 2005, the population is estimated to be 69,900. Average household size in 2005 was 2.33, which was higher than the citywide average of 2.14. However, average household size has been dropping in Far Northeast and Southeast as it has in other neighborhoods across the city. This trend may reverse in the coming years as former public housing complexes are replaced by new single family homes and townhomes, and as infill development takes places on vacant land. 1803.1 Approximately 96 percent of the area’s residents are African-American, which is significantly higher than the citywide average of 60 percent. Only about one percent of the area’s residents are of Hispanic origin, and fewer than two percent are foreign born. Relative to the city as a whole, the area has higher percentages of children and seniors. About 27 percent of the residents are under 18, compared to a citywide average of 20 percent. About 14 percent are over 65, compared to the citywide average of 12 percent. 1803.2 [SIDEBAR: Relative to the city as a whole, the area has higher percentages of children and seniors.

AREA ELEM ENTS COMPREHENSIVE PLAN DISTRICT ELEMENTS ADOPTED 12/19/06 P. 2-62 Housing Characteristics 1804 The 2000 Census reported that 18 percent of the homes in Far Northeast and Southeast were single family detached homes, and 28 percent were single family attached homes (row houses and townhouses These are slightly higher than the percentages for the city as a whole. Conversely, only 8 percent of the area’s housing stock consists of multi-family buildings of 20 units or more, compared to 32 percent for the city as a whole. Relative to the rest of the District of Columbia, Far Northeast and Southeast has a much higher percentage of small apartment buildings. About one-third of the area’s housing units were in buildings with 5 to 19 units—almost twice the citywide proportion. In 2000, nearly 13 percent of the housing units in Far Northeast and Southeast were vacant. 1804.1 The 2000 Census reported that 41 percent of the households in the Planning Area were homeowners and 59 percent were renters. These percentages are identical to the city as a whole. 1804.2 Income and Employment 1805 Data from the Department of Employment Services and the Office of Planning indicates there were 12,400 jobs in Far Northeast and Southeast in 2005, primarily in local-serving businesses, public schools, and government. This represents just 1.7 percent of the city’s job base. Most employed residents in Far Northeast and Southeast commute to jobs elsewhere in the city and region, with about 34 percent commuting to Central Washington, 31 percent commuting to Maryland and Virginia, 30 percent commuting elsewhere in the District of Columbia, and only five percent working within the Far Northeast and Southeast community. As of the 2000 Census, median household income in the Planning Area was $31,507, compared to a citywide median of $45,927. 1805.1 Projections 1806 Based on land availability, planning policies, and regional growth trends, Far Northeast and Southeast is projected to begin adding households, population, and jobs during the next five years and continue growing through 2025. The Planning Area is expected to grow from 29,700 households in 2005 to 35,200 households in 2025, with an attendant 20 percent increase in population from 69,900 to 83,800. Although this is roughly the same number of residents the Area had in 1990, the addition of over 5,000 new homes (including more than 1,000 homes on former public housing sites at Capitol Gateway Estates and Eastgate Gardens, and infill development at Kenilworth-Parkside) will bring new vitality and energy to the community. Much of the growth in Far Northeast and Southeast is expected to consist of new lowdensity housing, particularly on vacant single family lots in Deanwood and Marshall Heights. Moderatedensity housing and mixed use development will be concentrated around the Metro stations, on redeveloped public housing sites, and along corridor streets. 1806.1 401 [PULLQUOTE: Based on land availability, planning policies, and regional growth trends, Far Northeast and Southeast is projected to begin adding households, population, and jobs during the next five years and continue growing through 2025.] The number of jobs is expected to increase from about 12,400 today to 16,100 in 2025. Most of the increase will take place around the Minnesota Avenue Metro station, at Kenilworth-Parkside, at the revitalized Skyland Shopping Center, and along East Capitol Street. 1806.2 AREA ELEM ENTS COMPREHENSIVE PLAN DISTRICT ELEMENTS ADOPTED 12/19/06 P. 2-63 Planning and Development Priorities 1807 Four Comprehensive Plan workshops took place in Far Northeast and Southeast during 2005 and 2006. These meetings provided an opportunity for residents to discuss both citywide and neighborhood planning issues. The Advisory Neighborhood Commissions and groups such as the Ward 7 Leadership Council also provided a voice for local priorities and concerns. There have also been many meetings in the community not directly connected to the Comprehensive Plan, but focusing on long-range planning issues. These meetings have covered topics such as Kenilworth Avenue road improvements, the future of Watts Branch, reuse plans for Skyland Shopping Center, and the upgrading of “Great Streets” like Pennsylvania Avenue SE. 1807.1 The community delivered several key messages during these meetings, summarized below: 1807.2 (a) The low density character that typifies most Far Northeast and Southeast neighborhoods should be maintained. While it is recognized that the area contains much vacant land with the potential for infill development, this development should generally be similar in density to what exists today. This is one of the few areas in the city with opportunities to build three- and four- bedroom homes suitable for families with children. Whereas the neighborhood lost families to Prince George’s County and elsewhere in the past, it may gain families from these areas in the future if it builds appropriately designed housing, provides quality schools, and improves public services b) While protecting established single family neighborhoods is a priority, Far Northeast and Southeast recognizes the need to provide a variety of new housing choices. More density is appropriate on land within one-quarter mile of the Metro stations at Minnesota Avenue, Benning Road, and Deanwood, and on the District side of the Southern Avenue and Capitol Heights stations. The commercially zoned land along the Nannie Helen Burroughs, Minnesota Avenue, and Pennsylvania Avenue “Great Streets” corridors also offer opportunities for somewhat denser uses than exist today. These areas may provide opportunities for apartments, condominiums, townhomes, assisted living facilities and other types of housing, provided that measures are taken to buffer adjacent lower density neighborhoods, address parking and traffic issues, and mitigate other community concerns. [PULLQUOTE: While protecting established single family neighborhoods is a priority, Far Northeast and Southeast recognizes the need to provide a variety of new housing choices. More density is appropriate on land within one-quarter mile of the Metro stations at Minnesota Avenue, Benning Road, and Deanwood, and on the District side of the Southern Avenue and Capitol Heights stations.] (c) The neighborhood is underserved by retail stores and services, including the “basics” such as sitdown restaurants, banks, hardware stores, drug stores, and movie theaters. These uses should be accommodated in the future by encouraging both public and private reinvestment in the established commercial districts. The upgrading of Skyland and development of Capitol Gateway should go a long 402 way toward meeting these needs—but these centers are not conveniently located for everyone in the community. Neighborhoods like Deanwood and Fairlawn would benefit from additional quality retail services. The Minnesota-Benning commercial district, in particular, should evolve into a stronger, more vital shopping district in the future, attracting customers from both sides of the Anacostia River. [Photo Caption: Minnesota Avenue] (d) Renovation and rehabilitation of the housing stock should continue to be a priority, especially for the aging post-war apartment complexes and for developments with subsidized units. Steps should be taken to preserve affordable units in these complexes as they are renovated. In some cases, as was the AREA ELEM ENTS COMPREHENSIVE PLAN DISTRICT ELEMENTS ADOPTED 12/19/06 P. 2-64 case at East Capitol Dwellings and Eastgate Gardens, the best approach may be to replace deteriorated multi-family housing with new housing that better meets community needs. In other cases, the renovation of older apartments could be coupled with conversion to owner-occupancy, with provisions to help tenants become homeowners e) Code enforcement continues to be one of the top issues in the community. Residents are concerned about illegal dumping and unpermitted construction, inadequate notification of zoning changes, and the need for clean-up of blighted and abandoned properties. While these are operational issues that cannot be resolved through the Comprehensive Plan, the District must strive toward responsive, effective enforcement, maintenance, and customer service in the future f) More steps should be taken to improve environmental quality, especially along Watts Branch. Far Northeast and Southeast was impacted for years by the now defunct Benning Road incinerator and continues to face noise, air pollution, and truck traffic from I-295 and other thoroughfares. Programs to reduce these impacts, while improving physical connections to the Anacostia River, the Fort Circle Parks, and other open spaces in the area are high priorities. Indeed, much of the discussion at public meetings during the Comprehensive Plan revision focused on the need for better parks, cleaner streams, and more trees. While the community has more green space than many other parts of the District, this space has been neglected. Greater stewardship by Far Northeast and Southeast residents, coupled with more attention from the District and federal governments, will help restore the natural landscape as a place of beauty, spiritual enrichment, and diverse habitat (g) Additional improvements are needed to reduce traffic congestion, especially around the I-295/ Pennsylvania Avenue intersection and along Kenilworth Avenue. Parts of Far Northeast and Southeast are more than one mile from Metrorail and need better, more reliable bus connections to Metro. The safety of pedestrians and bicyclists continues to be an issue in many neighborhoods and at many intersections h) Schools, libraries, recreation centers, and other public facilities in Far Northeast and Southeast must be upgraded to meet the needs of a community on the rise. The recent modernizations of Kelly Miller Middle School and Randle Highlands Elementary School are a promising start, but there is much more to accomplish. Investment in schools should take place in tandem with investment in new housing, shopping, libraries, and other services, as it is at Eastgate Gardens, to create “whole” communities and not simply tracts of homes i) With an unemployment rate that is twice the citywide average, more must be done to strengthen the occupational skills of the Far Northeast and Southeast labor force. Job training, adult education, and vocational education programs are an essential part of the equation. Good access to Metrorail is also critical, to connect residents to jobs Downtown and elsewhere in the region. As noted in the citywide 403 elements of the Comp Plan, establishing a community college or branch campus of the University of the District of Columbia east of the Anacostia River would go a long way toward helping Far Northeast and Southeast youth prepare for good, quality jobs in the District economy. [PULLQUOTE: With an unemployment rate that is twice the citywide average, more must be done to strengthen the occupational skills of the Far Northeast and Southeast labor force. Job training, adult education, and vocational education programs are an essential part of the equation.] (j) Additional facilities and services for children and youth are needed in the Far Northeast/ Southeast Area. More than one in four residents of the Planning Area are under 18. Further increases in the number of children are likely as additional family housing is completed. New and expanded recreation centers, AREA ELEM ENTS COMPREHENSIVE PLAN DISTRICT ELEMENTS ADOPTED 12/19/06 P. 2-65 playgrounds, child care facilities, and similar facilities are urgently needed today and will continue to be needed in the future. The District must place a high priority on investment in these facilities to create a healthy environment for children as well as adults. Policies and Actions FNS-1.0 General Policies FNS-1.1 Guiding Growth and Neighborhood Conservation 1808 The following general policies and actions should guide growth and neighborhood conservation decisions in Far Northeast and Southeast. These policies and actions should be considered in tandem with those in the citywide elements of the Comprehensive Plan. 1808.1 Policy FNS-1.1.1: Conservation of Low Density Neighborhoods Recognize the value and importance of Far Northeast and Southeast’s stable single family neighborhoods to the character of the local community and to the entire District of Columbia. Ensure that the Comprehensive Plan and zoning designations for these neighborhoods reflect and protect the existing low density land use pattern while allowing for infill development that is compatible with neighborhood character. 1808.2 [Photo Caption: Hillcrest] Policy FNS-1.1.2: Development of New Housing Encourage new housing for area residents on vacant lots and around Metro stations within the community, and on underutilized commercial sites along the area’s major avenues. Strongly encourage the rehabilitation and renovation of existing housing in Far Northeast and Southeast, taking steps to ensure that the housing remains affordable for current and future residents. 1808.3 Policy FNS-1.1.3: Directing Growth Concentrate employment growth in Far Northeast and Southeast, including office and retail development, around the Deanwood, Minnesota Avenue and Benning Road Metrorail station areas, at the Skyland Shopping Center, and along the Nannie Helen Burroughs Avenue, Minnesota Avenue, Benning Road, and Pennsylvania Avenue SE “Great Streets” corridors. Provide improved pedestrian, bus, and automobile access to these areas, and improve their visual and urban design qualities. These areas should be safe, inviting, pedestrian-oriented places. 1808.4 Policy FNS-1.1.4: Retail Development Support the revitalization of the neighborhood commercial areas listed in Policy FNS-1.1.3 with new businesses and activities that provide needed retail services to the adjacent neighborhoods and that are 404 compatible with surrounding land uses. 1808.5 Policy FNS-1.1.5: Prince George’s County Work closely with Prince George’s County and the Maryland National Capital Parks and Planning Commission to guide the development of land along the Maryland/District line, especially around the Capitol Heights and Southern Avenue Metro stations. Safe pedestrian access to these stations should be provided. Given the proximity of the Naylor Road station to the District line (about 1000 feet collaborative transit-oriented development planning around this station is also encouraged. 1808.6 AREA ELEM ENTS COMPREHENSIVE PLAN DISTRICT ELEMENTS ADOPTED 12/19/06 P. 2-66 Policy FNS-1.1.6: Residential Rehabilitation Encourage the rehabilitation of single family homes in the Fairlawn and Twining neighborhoods, and the renovation of vacant deteriorating apartment units, especially in Marshall Heights, Lincoln Heights, Northeast Boundary, Greenway, Randle Highlands (south of Pennsylvania Avenue SE and along 29th Street between Erie and Denver Streets. 1808.7 Policy FNS-1.1.7: Row House Neighborhoods In the Fairlawn and Twining neighborhoods, encourage infill housing constructed in the architectural style and materials compatible with the brick row houses and semi-detached homes that predominate in these areas. New development in these neighborhoods should be consistent with prevailing densities. 1808.8 [Photo Caption: Fairlawn} Policy FNS-1.1.8: Buffering Improve the interface between the I-295 Freeway/rail corridor and adjacent residential uses, especially in the Fairlawn, Greenway, and Twining neighborhoods. These improvements should protect the neighborhoods from noise, odor, vibration, and other freeway impacts while also providing a more positive visual impression of the community from the highway itself. 1808.9 Policy FNS-1.1.9: Congestion Management Re-examine traffic control and management programs along major Far Northeast and Southeast arterial streets, particularly along Pennsylvania and Minnesota Avenues, East Capitol Street, Benning Road, Branch Avenue, and Naylor Road, and develop measures to improve pedestrian safety and mitigate the effects of increased local and regional traffic on residential streets. 1808.10 Policy FNS-1.1.10: Transit Improvements Improve bus service to the Metrorail stations from neighborhoods throughout Far Northeast and Southeast, particularly in the southern part of the Planning Area. 1808.11 Policy FNS-1.1.11: Anacostia Light Rail Coordinate land use and transportation decisions along the alignment of the proposed light rail line on the former CSX railroad tracks, making the most of the opportunities for new transit-served development along the Minnesota Avenue corridor at Pennsylvania Avenue, Benning Road, East Capitol Street, and points in between. 1808.12 Action FNS-1.1-A: Façade Improvements Encourage urban design and façade improvements in the established commercial districts along Naylor Road, Minnesota Avenue, Benning Road, Branch Avenue, Alabama Avenue, Nannie Helen Burroughs Avenue, Division Avenue, and Pennsylvania Avenue SE. These improvements should respect and enhance historic structures and landmarks in these areas. 1808.13 Action FNS-1.1-B: Expansion of NCR Program Expand the Neighborhood Commercial Revitalization Program operated by the Marshall Heights Community Development Organization (MHCDO) to include additional neighborhood commercial areas 405 in Far Northeast and Southeast. 1808.14 Action FNS-1.1-C: Joint Planning Agreement with Prince George’s County Develop a joint planning agreement with the Maryland National Capital Park and Planning Commission/ Prince George’s County to coordinate the mutual review of projects and area plans on both sides of the District/Maryland line. 1808.15 AREA ELEM ENTS COMPREHENSIVE PLAN DISTRICT ELEMENTS ADOPTED 12/19/06 P. 2-67 Action FNS-1.1-DE: Kenilworth Avenue Transportation Study Implement the recommendations of the Kenilworth Avenue transportation study to better manage truck traffic and to separate local traffic from through-traffic on neighborhood streets. 1808.16 [Photo Caption: The Kenilworth Industrial “Triangle”] FNS-1.2 Conserving and Enhancing Community Resources 1809 Policy FNS-1.2.1: Watts Branch and Pope Branch Conserve and improve Watts Branch and Pope Branch as safe, healthy natural resource areas. Undertake capital improvements to acquire land, improve trails, provide recreational features, and restore water quality and natural habitat. Promote District maintenance, enforcement, and community stewardship projects to keep the streambed and parklands clean, reduce crime and illegal dumping, and ensure that the parks remain resources that the whole community can enjoy. 1809.1 [Photo Caption: Watts Branch] Policy FNS-1.2.2: Connecting To the River Link the neighborhoods of Far Northeast and Southeast to the Anacostia River through trail, path, transit, and road improvements. Provide new amenities and facilities in the waterfront parks that meet the needs of Far Northeast and Southeast residents. 1809.2 Policy FNS-1.2.3: Fort Dupont Park Improve access to Fort Dupont Park by providing additional parking, bicycle and pedestrian access, and public transit service.

Such views are rare in the District and should be cherished and maintained. Policy FNS-1.2.6: Historic Resources Protect and restore buildings and places of potential historic significance in Far Northeast and Southeast, including Woodlawn Cemetery, the Antioch Baptist Church, the Shrimp Boat Restaurant, the Strand Theater, the Pennsylvania Avenue Commercial District between Minnesota and Alabama Avenues, the Minnesota/Benning Commercial District, and the Deanwood and Burrville neighborhoods. 1809.5 Policy FNS-1.2.7: Health Care Facilities Provide additional facilities to meet the mental and physical health needs of Far Northeast and Southeast residents, including primary care facilities, youth development centers, family counseling, drug abuse 406 and alcohol treatment facilities. Such facilities are vital to reduce crime and promote positive youth development. Specific plans for new social service and health facilities should be developed through needs assessments, agency master plans, strategic plans, and the city’s public facility planning process. AREA ELEM ENTS COMPREHENSIVE PLAN DISTRICT ELEMENTS ADOPTED 12/19/06 P. 2-68 All plans should be prepared in collaboration with the community, with input from local ANCs and civic associations, residents and businesses, and local community development corporations and non-profit service providers. 1809.6 Policy FNS-1.2.8: Facilities for Children and Youth Develop additional parks, recreation centers, playgrounds, and other facilities which meet the needs of children and youth in the Far Northeast/ Southeast community. The District must recognize that children are the future of Far Northeast/ Southeast, and should have a positive and healthy environment in which to live, play, and grow. Policy FNS-1.2.9: Kingman and Heritage Islands Retain Kingman and Heritage Islands as natural sanctuaries. Uses should be limited to an interpretive nature center, trails, public art, passive open space, and pedestrian accessways. {This policy was moved from 1509.8 due to the Planning Area Boundary change} Action FNS-1.2-A: Historic Surveys Conduct historical surveys in Deanwood, Burrville and Randle Highlands (south of Pennsylvania Avenue, S.E Based on the outcome, prepare nominations to the National Register, incorporating the community’s recommendations as part of the nomination process. 1809.7 Action FNS-1.2-B: Marvin Gaye Park Implement the Plan for Marvin Gaye Park along Watts Branch, including restored habitat and natural features, trails and bridges, meadows and nature sanctuaries, and safety improvements for park visitors. 1809.8 Action FNS-1.2-C: Fort Dupont Park Improvements In collaboration with the National Park Service, explore the feasibility of developing additional community-serving recreational facilities at Fort Dupont Park, including indoor swimming and tennis facilities, equestrian facilities, and an upgraded outdoor theater. 1809.9 FNS-2.0 Policy Focus Areas 1810 The Comprehensive Plan has identified eight areas in Far Northeast and Southeast as “policy focus areas,” indicating that they require a level of direction and guidance above that in the prior section of this Area Element and in the citywide elements. These eight areas are: Minnesota/Benning Business District Deanwood Capitol View/Northeast Boundary Benning Road Metro Marshall Heights/ Benning Ridge Pennsylvania Avenue SE Skyland Kenilworth-Parkside 1810.1 [INSERT Map 17.1: Far Northeast and Southeast Policy Focus Areas] AREA ELEM ENTS COMPREHENSIVE PLAN DISTRICT ELEMENTS ADOPTED 12/19/06 P. 2-69 Table 17.2: Policy Focus Areas Within and Adjacent to Far Northeast and Southeast 1810.2 Within Far Northeast and Southeast 2.1 Minnesota Benning Business District (see p. 18-14) 2.2 Deanwood 407 (see p. 18-17) 2.3 Capitol View/ Northeast Boundary (see p. 18-19) 2.4 Benning Road Metro (see p. 18-20) 2.5 Marshall Heights/ Benning Ridge (see p. 18-21) 2.6 Pennsylvania Avenue SE (see p. 18-22) 2.7 Skyland (see p. 18-23) 2.8 Kenilworth/ Parkside (see p.

Sometimes referred to as “Downtown Ward 7”, it includes the 150,000 square foot East of the River Park Shopping Center, the Senator Square Shopping Center (anchored by the former Senator Theater and a variety of small retail and service businesses serving Far Northeast and Southeast. While this area functions as an important community shopping district, some of its properties are underutilized and consist of empty parking lots, open storage, vacant buildings, and undeveloped land. The shopping district itself lacks the variety of retail stores needed to serve the community. It also suffers from poor design, confusing access and parking, and—with the exception of the historic Senator Theater—a lack of distinctive facades and storefronts. 1811.1 A complex of office buildings, including a 4-story Metro parking garage, and a new headquarters for the Department of Employment Services and Department of Human Services, are planned on a 10-acre area site just south of the Minnesota Avenue Station. Space for future private offices and retail stores will also be provided. The development should provide a catalyst for revitalization, and bring new revenue and a larger customer base to the adjacent shopping area. Complementary uses such as a civic space/ urban plaza, public art, and cultural facilities should be strongly encouraged, and additional infill development should be supported on vacant lots and underutilized land to the south and east. 1811.2 AREA ELEM ENTS COMPREHENSIVE PLAN DISTRICT ELEMENTS ADOPTED 12/19/06 P. 2-70 Improvements to Minnesota Avenue are planned to maintain traffic flow, and make the area safer for pedestrians. Any development in this area should maximize Metrorail access while taking care to provide appropriate buffers and transitions to adjacent uses. 1811.3 Policy FNS-2.1.1: Minnesota/Benning Revitalization Support revitalization and further development of the area around the Minnesota Avenue Metro station, including the adjacent business district to the south along Minnesota Avenue. Upgrade and expand 408 existing businesses in this area, and encourage new small business development, educational facilities, and community-based human services such as job training, health care, and child care facilities. Any new public facility in this area should contribute to its image as an attractive and vibrant community hub and should be responsive to the needs of surrounding neighborhoods. 1811.4 Policy FNS-2.1.2: Shopping Center Improvements Improve the East of the River Park and Senator Square shopping areas at Minnesota Avenue and Benning Road as quality shopping areas. This area should function as a single, cohesive business and mixed use district rather than a series of disconnected shopping centers. 1811.5 Policy FNS-2.1.3: Minnesota Avenue Station Area Mixed Use Development Encourage mixed use development including medium density multi-family housing around the Minnesota Avenue Metro station, recognizing the opportunity for “transit-oriented” development that boosts neighborhood businesses, reduces the need for auto commuting, and enhances the quality of the pedestrian environment along Minnesota Avenue. 1811.6 [Photo Caption: Minnesota Avenue Metrorail Station] Action FNS-2.1-A: Financial Assistance for Small Businesses Target the Senator Square and East of the River Park Shopping centers for District financial assistance, grants, and loans for façade improvements and small business development. 1811.7 Action FNS-2.1-B: Government Center Complete the Government Center Office project, including the new headquarters for DOES and DHS, and the adjacent Metrorail parking garage. Undertake concurrent streetscape and landscape improvements to beautify this important gateway to Far Northeast and Southeast, improve pedestrian safety, and better connect the Metro station with the shopping district to the south. 1811.8 FNS-2.2 Deanwood 1812 Deanwood is one of Far Northeast and Southeast’s oldest communities; much of its housing stock dates from the early 20th century. Several well-known African-American architects, including W. Sidney Pittman and Howard D. Woodson, and many skilled local craftsmen designed and built many of its homes. The neighborhood was once home to Nannie Helen Burroughs, an early civil rights leader and the founder of the National Training School for Women and Girls, an independent boarding school for African-American girls founded in 1909 and located on 50th Street NE. From 1921 to 1940, Deanwood was also home to Suburban Gardens (50th and Hayes NE a black-owned amusement park that served thousands of African-American residents during a time of racial segregation. 1812.1 [PULLQUOTE: Deanwood is one of Far Northeast and Southeast’s oldest communities; much of its housing stock dates from the early 20th century.

Woodson, and many skilled local craftsmen designed and built many of its homes.] AREA ELEM ENTS COMPREHENSIVE PLAN DISTRICT ELEMENTS ADOPTED 12/19/06 P. 2-71 Deanwood’s relatively low density, small wood-frame and brick homes, and dense tree cover give it a small town character that is unique in the District of Columbia. At the same time, there are hundreds of vacant single family lots in the community, creating the potential for future infill housing on many blocks. Some of the vacant properties have caused problems in the past, attracting crime, dumping, and 409 neighborhood blight. Non-conforming uses, including an illegal trash transfer station, further challenge neighborhood integrity and environmental quality. 1812.2 While new housing is encouraged in the Deanwood and adjacent Burrville neighborhoods, density and design should complement prevailing community character. Rehabilitation of existing housing is also strongly encouraged, as much of Deanwood has suffered from disinvestment over the past 40 years. The neighborhood’s main commercial streets—Nannie Helen Burroughs Avenue and Division Avenue—have strong potential for infill and revitalization. The intersection of these two streets in particular should be strengthened as a neighborhood hub, with new retail and service businesses strongly encouraged. 1812.3 Deanwood also suffers from land use and transportation conflicts, particularly on its western edge along Kenilworth Avenue. An industrial area along the CSX line provides jobs and services, but also creates noise, truck traffic, and visual blight. Improved buffering of this area from the adjacent neighborhood and additional development around the Deanwood Metro station can reduce future conflicts while improving overall community appearance. 1812.4 Policy FNS-2.2.1: Deanwood’s Residential Character Strongly encourage infill development on vacant lots in the Deanwood community. This development should respect and perpetuate the low-density, single family character of the neighborhood, with new one and two-family homes that complement existing architectural traditions and community character. 1812.5 [Photo Caption: Deanwood] Policy FNS-2.2.2: Nannie Helen Burroughs Avenue Focus neighborhood-serving commercial development in Deanwood along the Nannie Helen Burroughs Corridor, with the intersection of Division and Nannie Helen Burroughs Avenues restored as a community hub. 1812.6 Policy FNS-2.2.3: Kenilworth Industrial Area Upgrade and expand the commercial and industrial area along Kenilworth Avenue, particularly the Kenilworth Industrial Park, and provide for additional employment in this industrial corridor. Improve the appearance of this area through design standards, building maintenance, and public space and street improvements. Encourage local businesses and entrepreneurs to use the business incubator in this corridor in order to create increased job opportunities for area residents. 1812.7 Policy FNS-2.2.4: Deanwood Metro Station Provide for new moderate density housing in the vicinity of the Deanwood Metrorail Station, and expanded neighborhood-serving commercial uses along Kenilworth Avenue NE. Ensure that appropriate buffers are provided between new development and the adjacent residential areas. 1812.8 Policy FNS-2.2.5: Deanwood Industrial Buffers Improve buffers between the industrial and residential uses in the Deanwood and Central Northeast neighborhoods, particularly where the proximity of these uses to one another is creating conflicts. 1812.9 AREA ELEM ENTS COMPREHENSIVE PLAN DISTRICT ELEMENTS ADOPTED 12/19/06 P. 2-72 Action FNS-2.2-A: Deanwood Small Area Plan Prepare a Small Area Plan for the Deanwood neighborhood, including the Metro station area, the Nannie Helen Burroughs and Division Avenue business districts, and the surrounding residential community. 1812.10 410 Action FNS-2.2-B: Division and Nannie Helen Burroughs Commercial Explore the option of acquiring underused land from DCPS for commercial development at the intersection of Division and Nannie Helen Burroughs Avenues NE. 1812.11 Action FNS-2.2-C: Minnesota Avenue Extension Extend Minnesota Avenue from Sheriff Road to Meade Street N.E. to improve access to the Deanwood Metrorail Station and to eliminate the private bus company’s encroachment on public space. 1812.12 FNS-2.3 Capitol Gateway Estates/ Northeast Boundary 1813 Capitol View and Northeast Boundary are the easternmost neighborhoods in the District of Columbia. At the heart of the community, Capitol Gateway Estates is being constructed on a 40-acre site that formerly housed the 1,100-unit East Capitol Dwellings public housing project. Working through the federal HOPE VI program, East Capitol Dwellings was demolished in the early 2000s. The first phase of the revitalized project, consisting of 151 units of senior housing, opened in 2005. An additional 550 units of market rate and subsidized housing will be completed in the coming years. The complex also includes a new shopping district along East Capitol Street. 1813.1 [Photo Caption: New senior housing at Capitol Gateway Estates] Capitol Gateway holds the promise of bringing new life to adjacent neighborhoods along both side of East Capitol Street. Vacant sites in the immediate vicinity can support infill housing, with moderate densities on the blocks closest to the Capitol Heights Metro station (across the state line in Maryland) and lower densities elsewhere. A few blocks to the north, the commercial area along Dix Street can support infill commercial and residential development, providing needed services to the adjacent Northeast Boundary neighborhood. A few blocks to the west, the 190-unit Richardson Dwellings and the even larger Lincoln Heights public housing project provide essential affordable housing resources but also present the challenges of concentrated poverty, chronic unemployment, and high crime. A planned “new community” at Lincoln Heights would replace the public housing with mixed income housing—including one-for-one replacement of the subsidized units. 1813.2 Improvements to Marvin Gaye Park (Watts Branch) and public facilities such as Woodson High School are an important part of revitalizing the Capitol View community. The park in particular can become a stronger source of community pride and an important link to new recreational areas along the Anacostia River. 1813.3 Policy FNS-2.3.1: Northeast Boundary Neighborhood Leverage the development of Capitol Gateway Estates to achieve additional reinvestment in the Northeast Boundary neighborhood, particularly the rehabilitation of existing housing and the development of new mixed income family housing on vacant lots. 1813.4 Policy FNS-2.3.2: 61st and Dix Improve the commercial area along Dix Street between 60th and Eastern Avenue, encouraging new retail businesses and services that benefit the adjacent community. 1813.5 AREA ELEM ENTS COMPREHENSIVE PLAN DISTRICT ELEMENTS ADOPTED 12/19/06 P. 2-73 Policy FNS-2.3.3: Development as a Catalyst for Marvin Gaye Park Design development along Marvin Gaye (Watts Branch) Park in a manner that improves park visibility, access, appearance, and security. The park should be treated as the “front door” to the adjacent neighborhood and a valued amenity for development along its perimeter. 1813.6 411 Action FNS-2.3-A: Land Acquisition At 61st and Dix Continue to work with community development organizations in the acquisition of vacant lots at 61st and Dix streets NE, and their development with local serving commercial uses and services. 1813.7 Action FNS-2.3-B: Lincoln Heights New Community Pursue redevelopment of Lincoln Heights as a “new community”, replacing the existing public housing development with new mixed income housing, including an equivalent number of affordable units and additional market rate units. 1813.8 FNS-2.4 Benning Road Metro Station Area 1814 The Benning Road Metrorail station is located at the corner of Benning Road and East Capitol Street. The station, which is served by Metro’s Blue Line, opened in 1980 and currently has one of the lowest volumes of passenger traffic in the Metrorail system. Surrounding land uses include auto-oriented commercial businesses, including the Shrimp Boat restaurant, single family homes and duplexes, and small two and three-story apartment buildings. A controversial proposal to develop a five-story office building for the Court Supervision and Offender Services Administration at the station was tabled in 2005. While the proposal generated much debate, it did provide an opportunity for area residents to articulate more clearly the type of development that is desired in the station area. 1814.1 The Benning Road station area should become a much more attractive community hub in the future, comprised of pedestrian-oriented housing, retail, and recreational uses. Large-scale office buildings and surface parking lots should be discouraged here; rather the site is most appropriate as a walkable neighborhood center with low-scale moderate density residential buildings containing ground floor retail, service, and similar uses. Amenities such as plazas, public art, attractive facades, and pocket parks should be provided as the area develops, and safe street crossings for pedestrians and bicyclists should be ensured. Special care should be taken to preserve the adjacent neighborhoods, improve the hazardous and confusing street intersections in the vicinity, and emphasize land uses and activities which benefit area residents. 1814.2 [PULLQUOTE: The Benning Road station area should become a much more attractive community hub in the future, comprised of pedestrian-oriented housing, retail, and recreational uses.] Policy FNS-2.4.1: Benning Road Station Area Development Support development of the Benning Road Metro Station area as a pedestrian-oriented mixed use area, including moderate density housing, retail, service uses, and public spaces and amenities that serve adjacent neighborhoods. Future development must recognize and be consistent with the low-density, residential character of the adjacent neighborhoods. 1814.3 Action FNS-2.4-A: Benning Road Station Transit-Oriented Development Plan Undertake a community planning process for the Benning Road Metro station, defining specific land use and urban design improvements, and more clearly establishing the community’s vision for the station area. 1814.4 [Photo Caption: The Shrimp Boat is considered by many to be a local landmark] AREA ELEM ENTS COMPREHENSIVE PLAN DISTRICT ELEMENTS ADOPTED 12/19/06 P. 2-74 FNS-2.5 Marshall Heights/ Benning Ridge 1815 The Marshall Heights/ Benning Ridge area is located south of East Capitol Street and east of the Fort Circle Parks. The area includes a mix of single family and semi-detached homes and apartments, and has several hundred scattered vacant lots. Marshall Heights and Benning Ridge were especially hard hit by population loss, crime, property abandonment, and disinvestment during the 1970s, 80s, and 90s. While 412 the communities have begun to rebound since 2000, significant improvements are still needed. 1815.1 Several developments have recently been completed or are planned. Hilltop Terrace and JW King Senior Housing have added nearly 100 new homes along Benning Road. Just to the north, the former Eastgate Gardens public housing complex is planned for redevelopment with 269 new homes—including senior housing, public housing, market-rate family housing, and a community arts center. Continued residential infill and rehabilitation is strongly encouraged, taking care to develop at densities that are appropriate to neighborhood character. Improvement of retail centers, including the small shopping centers at Benning Road and H Street, and Benning Road between F and G Streets will also be pursued in order to upgrade existing businesses and provide needed services to the surrounding communities. 1815.2 Policy FNS-2.5.1: Marshall Heights Infill Support the development of the many scattered vacant lots in the Marshall Heights community with new low density residential development, especially one- and two-family homes. This will provide ownership opportunities for area residents and housing stock needed to attract families with children back to Far Northeast and Southeast. Improve schools, parks, and other public services in Marshall Heights to meet the needs created by additional growth, and to attract families to the area. 1815.3 Action FNS-2.5-A: Eastgate Gardens Develop Eastgate Gardens as a mixed income community containing senior housing, public housing, home ownership opportunities, and a community arts center. As population increases here and elsewhere in Marshall Heights, pursue the refurbishing of shopping areas along Benning Road to better serve the surrounding community. 1815.4 Action FNS-2.5-B: Marshall Heights Zoning Study Conduct a zoning study of the Marshall Heights and Benning Ridge neighborhoods to ensure that areas that are predominantly single family in character areas are appropriately zoned. Presently, much of this area is zoned for multi-family housing, despite the fact that one and two-family homes are prevalent. 1815.5 FNS-2.6 Pennsylvania Avenue Southeast Corridor 1816 Pennsylvania Avenue SE is one of the busiest arterials in the District of Columbia, carrying 96,000 vehicles a day across the Sousa Bridge and 53,000 vehicles per day between Minnesota and Branch Avenues. For several years, a Citizens Task Force has been exploring strategies for addressing traffic congestion on the avenue while mitigating related problems such as noise, pedestrian safety, and cutthrough traffic on local streets. Parallel efforts by the District have looked at land use and design issues, including the character of the street environment and the quality of the business districts in Fairlawn, Penn Branch, and Fort Davis. In 2005, plans to redesign the Sousa Bridge/I-295 on and off-ramps were announced as part of a broader strategy to improve the corridor and invest in new sidewalks, lighting, and trees. 1816.1 The future of Pennsylvania Avenue has profound impacts on the adjacent neighborhoods of Fairlawn, Twining, Dupont Park, Penn Branch, Hillcrest, Fort Davis, and Fairfax Village.

Particular emphasis should be placed on upgrading the shopping area between Fairlawn Avenue and 28th Street SE. This corridor, initially developed as a walkable shopping street, suffers from a lack of continuity, poor retail choices, many vacant storefronts, parking management issues, and traffic patterns that are dangerous for pedestrians. 1816.2 [PULLQUOTE: The future of Pennsylvania Avenue has profound impacts on the adjacent neighborhoods of Fairlawn, Twining, Dupont Park, Penn Branch, Hillcrest, Fort Davis, and Fairfax Village.

These recommendations include streetscape, signage, and parking improvements, speed controls, signal timing changes, pedestrian and bicycle safety improvements, travel lane and pavement marking adjustments, traffic calming measures to avoid cut-through traffic on local side streets, and changes to the I-295/Pennsylvania Avenue interchange. 1816.5 Action FNS-2.6-B: Great Street Improvements Implement the “Great Street” Plan to beautify Pennsylvania Avenue, maintaining the width of the street, landscaping the avenue from the Sousa Bridge to the Maryland border, and taking other steps to manage traffic flow and avoid negative effects and cut-through traffic on adjacent neighborhoods. 1816.6 [Photo Caption: Residential uses near the Pennsylvania Avenue SE corridor] FNS-2.7 Skyland 1817 Skyland Shopping Center occupies 16 acres at the intersection of Naylor Road, Good Hope Road, and Alabama Road SE. When it was initially developed in the 1940s, the 170,000 square foot complex of free-standing retail buildings was one of the first auto-oriented shopping centers in Washington. Along with the adjacent 95,000 square foot Good Hope Marketplace, it is the principal commercial center serving the southern part of Far Northeast and Southeast. Plans to renovate and modernize Skyland have been evolving for many years. The center has not adapted to changing trends in retailing, and is not fully meeting the needs of the more than 80,000 residents who live in its primary market area. Its redevelopment as a “Town Center” with more than 275,000 square feet of leasable space is being pursued by the National Capital Revitalization Commission. 1817.1 Reinvestment is Skyland is an important part of the District’s efforts to provide better shopping options 414 for neighborhoods east of the Anacostia River, reduce the loss of retail dollars to the suburbs, and make the East of the River area more attractive to existing and future residents.

Together with the Good Hope Marketplace, these two centers should function as the primary business district for adjacent neighborhoods, providing a diverse array of quality goods and services for area residents. 1817.3 Policy FNS-2.7.2: Naylor Road Corridor Improvements Work collaboratively with local businesses and residents of Naylor Gardens, Hillcrest, and Knox Hill/Buena Vista to upgrade local commercial and residential uses and improve the appearance of the Naylor Road corridor between Skyland Shopping Center and Suitland Parkway. Pedestrian and bicycle access to the Naylor Road Metro station also should be improved. 1817.4 Action FNS-2.7-A: Revitalization Task Force Continue to work wth the Skyland Area Revitalization Task Force to assist small businesses and private enterprise in the Skyland area. 1817.5 Action FNS-2.7-B: Fort Baker Drive Buffering Work with property owners to develop and maintain a suitable visual, sound and security buffer between Skyland Shopping Center and the adjacent residential areas along Fort Baker Drive. 1817.6 [Photo Caption: Skyland Shopping Center] FNS-2.8 Kenilworth-Parkside 1516 The upper reaches of the Anacostia River’s eastern shore include the communities of Kenilworth- Parkside, Mayfair Mansions, and Eastland Gardens. This area also includes Kenilworth Aquatic Gardens Park, the Kenilworth-Parkside Recreation Area, and wetlands and open space managed by the National Park Service. The Pepco Plant and the Benning Road Waste Transfer Station are located adjacent to this area on the north side of Benning Road. 1516.1 Kenilworth-Parkside was initially developed as low income housing in the 1940s. During the 1980s, the 464-unit public housing complex was touted by the federal government as a success story after property management responsibilities were transferred to the local tenant organization. Crime dropped dramatically, and the quality of life visibly improved. The area’s reputation as a testing ground for innovative housing policy continued through the 1990s. The public housing was sold and renovated and a “neotraditional town” was conceived on a 26-acre vacant site between Kenilworth and the Pepco Plant. About 100 affordable townhomes were constructed but most of the land remains vacant today. 1516.2 Over the next decade, buildout of the remaining area in Kenilworth-Parkside is expected. Plans call for some 1,500 units of new medium to high density housing, 250,000 to 500,000 square feet of office space, and 30,000 square feet of retail space. A reconstructed pedestrian bridge will connect this area to the Minnesota Avenue Metro station, making the area transit accessible for new residents and 415 employees. 1516.3 The pedestrian connection will help achieve an important goal of the Anacostia Waterfront Initiative in Far Northeast DC—improved access to the shoreline for the neighborhoods east of I-295. In addition to the Kenilworth-Parkside bridge, the creation of Marvin Gaye Park along Watts Branch, development of the Minnesota Avenue government center, and improvement of Nannie Helen Burroughs Avenue as a “great street” should all help unite the community on both sides of the freeway. 1516.4 AREA ELEM ENTS COMPREHENSIVE PLAN DISTRICT ELEMENTS ADOPTED 12/19/06 P. 2-77 [Photo Caption: Kenilworth-Parkside aerial view.

The Planning Area includes neighborhoods such as Historic Anacostia, Congress Heights, Hillsdale, Woodland, Fort Stanton, Barry Farm, Bellevue, Washington Highlands, Douglas/Shipley Terrace, Garfield Heights, and Knox Hill/ Buena Vista. Most of this area has historically been Council Ward 8, but prior to redistricting in 2002, the northern portion was in Ward 6. Planning Area boundaries are shown in Map to the left. 1900.1 Far Southeast/ Southwest is a community of surprising contrasts. It includes the 19th century row houses of Historic Anacostia as well as brand new communities like Henson Ridge and Wheeler Creek. Its housing ranges from single family homes in neighborhoods like Congress Heights, to garden apartments in neighborhoods like Washington Highlands and Fort Stanton, to high-rise apartments such as the Wyngates and Faircliff Plaza. 1900.2 It is home to two National Historic Landmarks—the residence of abolitionist champion Frederick Douglas at Cedar Hill, and the St. Elizabeths Hospital campus, one of the country’s most renowned institutions for the treatment of mental illness for more than 150 years. Its commercial areas range from a brand new shopping center under construction at Camp Simms to more traditional neighborhood centers along Martin Luther King Jr Avenue, Good Hope Road, and South Capitol Street. The community also includes open spaces and natural areas like Oxon Run and Oxon Cove. 1900.3 Anacostia and the surrounding Far Southeast/Southwest neighborhoods that surround it have stayed strong through difficult times. Many middle-class residents left the area in the 1970’s, 80’s and 90’s, affecting the stability of the area’s neighborhoods. Between 1990 and 2000 population in this Planning Area declined by nine percent and the poverty rate increased from 28 percent to 38 percent. The crime rate and unemployment rate remain chronically high and are well above the city and regional average. The average resident must go outside their neighborhood to shop, enjoy a restaurant, and even find basic services like groceries. 1900.4 Today, the priorities are clear: safer streets, better schools, more jobs, and improved housing choices. The Comprehensive Plan reflects these priorities in its policies and maps. Poverty, unemployment, illiteracy, crime, and other social issues must be addressed to improve the quality of life for residents in the Far Southeast/Southwest. For revitalization to truly succeed, all residents must be given opportunities to advance. 1900.5 The area’s social and economic needs affect its physical environment in many ways. They translate to a need for more facilities for vocational training and job placement like the One Stop Career Center on South Capitol Street. Community priorities mean that aging neighborhood schools like Savoy and Turner must be rebuilt; that aging libraries like the Washington Highlands Branch must be modernized; and that new recreation centers and cultural centers like Bald Eagle and the ARC are provided to create positive alternatives for at-risk youth and others. New opportunities for local entrepreneurs also are needed— providing a chance to start a business, hire local residents, and provide needed services to the community. 1900.6 AREA ELEM ENTS 417 COMPREHENSIVE PLAN DISTRICT ELEMENTS ADOPTED 12/19/06 P. 2-79 The strength of the District’s real estate market is already bringing a wave of change to the Far Southeast/Southwest. Thousands of affordable housing units have been constructed or rehabilitated since 2000. The HOPE VI projects have created many first time homeowners, including former public housing residents. Projects such as Monterrey Park, Livingston Apartments, Danbury Station, Royal Court and Congress Park are just a few examples of the improved housing choices in the area. The first new shopping center in over a decade is under construction—and after two decades of waiting, the community will finally have a full-service modern supermarket. 1900.7 Investment in public facilities has been a catalyst for housing development in the area. Bald Eagle Recreation Center and Fort Greble Recreation Center have received major upgrades in the last two years. The new Patterson Elementary School has opened, and several more schools are slated for major renovation or new construction. A new Senior Wellness Center opened in Congress Heights in 2002. 1900.8 The future of the Far Southeast/Southwest depends on active community engagement. The continued involvement of groups like the East of the River Community Development Corporation, Anacostia Economic Development Corporation, Far SW/SE Community Development Corporation, the United Planning Organization and the Far SE Family Strengthening Collaborative can help revitalize the community. Moreover, groups such as the Congress Heights and Fort Stanton Civic Associations, the Frederick Douglass Community Improvement Council, the Anacostia Coordinating Council and the Ward 8 Business Council provide a community resource and are an important voice in neighborhood and citywide affairs. 1900.9 [Photo Caption: Far Southeast/ Southwest includes the residence of abolitionist champion Frederick Douglas at Cedar Hill, a National Historic Landmark] Context History 1901 While “the Far Southeast/Southwest” is a new name for this part of the city, the area itself has a long and interesting history. 1901.1 In 1662, the first land grant in the Washington area was made to George Thompson on land along the east bank of the Potomac River, extending from Blue Plains to what is now the St. Elizabeths Campus. The land was farmed as a tobacco plantation until 1862. In 1863, a portion of the tract was leased by the government as an army post called Camp Stoneman. The post became a resort after the Civil War until it burned down in 1888. Other late 19th century uses in the Far Southeast/Southwest included a race course, a one-room schoolhouse on what is now Congress Heights School, and dairy farms. St. Elizabeths Hospital was founded in 1852, growing into the largest federal psychiatric facility in the country by 1940. More than 7,000 residents lived there at its peak. 1901.2 Present-day Anacostia was established as Uniontown in 1854 as a bedroom community for Navy Yard workers. The neighborhood was a “whites-only” community until abolitionist Fredrick Douglass purchased his home on Cedar Hill in 1877. Many of the original wood frame and brick homes, along with some of the original commercial structures along Good Hope Road and Martin Luther King Jr Avenue, still remain today and are protected through their designation as a 25-block Historic District. 1901.3 AREA ELEM ENTS COMPREHENSIVE PLAN DISTRICT ELEMENTS ADOPTED 12/19/06 P. 2-80 [PULLQUOTE: Many of the original wood frame and brick homes, along with some of the original commercial structures along Good Hope Road and Martin Luther King Jr Avenue, still remain today and are protected through their designation as a 25-block Historic District.] 418 By the turn of the century, the expanding capital city began to spread east of the Anacostia River. A seawall was constructed to protect the Anacostia shoreline and storm sewers were installed. In 1908, Washington Steel and Ordnance Company—best remembered as “the steel plant”—arrived at the foot of what is now Portland Street. The Army developed an airfield on the still rural land near the shoreline in 1917, with a ferry connection to Hains Point established a year later. The compound would eventually become Bolling Air Force Base and the Naval Air Station. 1901.4 Large farms still persisted through the 1920s and 30s. In fact, some of this area was still active farmland as recently as 50 years ago and longtime residents recall “moving out to the country” when they first arrived. Winding roads follow the natural contours of the land and reflect the area’s development during a time when great suburban growth was occurring beyond the city limits. The grid and diagonal road system that characterizes much of the rest of Washington was not followed, resulting in a more organic pattern of development. 1901.5 The Second World War was a period of great change in the Far Southeast/Southwest. The population grew by over 200 percent during the 1940s, as neighborhoods like Bellevue and Washington Highlands were developed. The wartime growth of Bolling Field and the Naval Research Laboratory fueled demand for housing, with thousands of garden apartments constructed. One of the complexes developed during this period was Barry Farm. Once literally a farm, the site was part of a 375-acre tract established in 1867 to provide freed slaves with an opportunity to become homeowners. 1901.6 After the War, apartments continued to be constructed, only now the arriving residents included many households displaced from urban renewal activities west of the Anacostia River. The influx of new residents was coupled with the closure of wartime industrial uses, such as the Navy armaments factory in Congress Heights. The combined effects of economic and social disruption triggered a long period of economic and population decline which started in the late 1950s and continued for four decades. By 2000, nearly one in six housing units in the Planning Area were vacant and more than one in three residents lived in poverty. 1901.7 Today, there are signs of a turn-around in many parts of the area. Transportation, economic development, and housing initiatives are underway, bringing new investment and promise of better times ahead. 1901.8 Land Use 1902 Excluding water, the Far Southeast/Southwest Planning Area comprises 4,687 acres, which represents about 12 percent of the city’s land area. Figure 18.1 indicates the land use mix in the area. 1902.1 [INSERT Figure 18.1: Land Use Composition in the Far Southeast/Southwest 1902.4] [Pie chart “slices” unchanged since July Draft] A majority of the land within the Planning Area—amounting to two-thirds of the total—is publicly owned. Federal properties such as Bolling Air Force Base comprise about 23 percent of the total, and parks—most of which are also under federal control—comprise 16 percent of the total. Local public facilities, consisting primarily of Blue Plains, DC Village, and school campuses, make up 9 percent. Roads make up 20 percent of the total area, slightly less than they do in the other nine Planning Areas. 1902.2 AREA ELEM ENTS COMPREHENSIVE PLAN DISTRICT ELEMENTS ADOPTED 12/19/06 P. 2-81 Residential uses make up 24 percent of the total area, or about 1,060 acres. Of this amount, more than 419 half consists of garden apartments, and about one-quarter consists of row houses and townhomes. Garden apartments predominate in Washington Highlands, Hillsdale, Barry Farm, Fort Stanton, Shipley Terrace, Douglass, and Knox Hill. Only about 163 acres in the Planning Area consists of single-family detached homes, mostly located in Bellevue and Congress Heights. 1902.3 The area has very little commercial and industrial land. These uses make up 1.5 percent of the total area, and consist primarily of a commercial spine extending along Good Hope Road, Martin Luther King Junior Avenue, and South Capitol Street. Good Hope/Martin Luther King form a traditional “Main Street” through Historic Anacostia with many small storefronts and neighborhood businesses. Further south along this spine, there are neighborhood commercial centers at Malcolm X Avenue, Atlantic Avenue, and Southern Avenue. There are scattered small shopping centers and convenience stores elsewhere in the Planning Area. 1902.5 The Far Southeast/Southwest includes about 188 acres of vacant land. Although this represents just four percent of the Planning Area total, it represents nearly one-quarter of the vacant land in the entire District of Columbia. Most of this acreage is residentially zoned and is privately owned, suggesting the potential for much change during the coming years. 1902.6 [Photo Caption: Henson Ridge] Demographics 1903 Table 18.1 shows basic demographic data for Far Southeast/ Southwest. In 2000, the Planning Area had a population of 64,600 or 11 percent of the city total. The area has lost 5 to 10 percent of its population in each decennial census since 1960. Estimates for 2005 indicate a leveling off in this decline over the last five years. Average household size in the Planning Area was 2.74 in 2005, which was substantially higher than the citywide average of 2.12. The larger household size suggests that there are more children here than elsewhere in the city. In fact, 36 percent of the area’s residents were under 18 in 2000, compared to 20 percent in the city as a whole. 1903.1 Approximately 93 percent of the area’s population is African-American, which is significantly higher than the citywide average of 60 percent. Only one percent of the area’s residents are of Hispanic origin and less than 2 percent are foreign born. 1903.3 Housing Characteristics 1904 There were about 26,900 housing units in the Far Southeast/Southwest as of the 2000 Census. About 16 percent of these units were vacant—nearly double the citywide average. Compared to the rest of the city, the Planning Area has an abundance of small apartment buildings. In fact, 20 percent of the housing units were in 5-9 unit buildings, and almost 30 percent were in 10-19 unit buildings. Both of these percentages are more than double the citywide averages. Only about six percent of the housing units were single family detached homes, less than half the citywide figure. 1904.1 As one might expect given the high percentage of apartments, the homeownership rate in the Planning Area is low. In fact, it was 20 percent in 2000—compared to 41 percent citywide. However, there are indications that the ownership rate is on the rise; it was only 14 percent in 1980 and much of the housing built since 2000 has been owner-occupied. 1904.2 [Photo Caption: Oxon Run Townhomes] 420 AREA ELEM ENTS COMPREHENSIVE PLAN DISTRICT ELEMENTS ADOPTED 12/19/06 P. 2-82 Table 18.1: Far Southeast/Southwest At A Glance 1903.2 Basic Statistics Land Area (square miles) 7.3 Population 1990 75,551 2000 64,618 2005 (estimated) 64,000 2025 (projected) 81,800 Households (2005 22,800 Household Population (2005 exclu des grou p qu arters 62,500 Persons Per Household (2005) 2.74 Jobs (2005) 21,800 Density (persons per sq mile 2005) 8,800 Year 2000 Census Data Profile Far Southeast/Southwest Planning Area Citywide Total of Total of Total Age Under 18 23,674 36.3 20.0 18-65 36,887 56.5 67.8 Over 65 4,681 7.2 12.3 Residents Below Poverty Level 24,419 37.8 20.2 Racial Composition White 2,979 4.6 30.6 Black 59,959 92.8 60.0 Native American 165 0.2 0.4 Asian/ Pacific Islander 399 0.6 2.6 Other 311 0.7 3.8 Multi-Racial 668 1.0 2.6 Hispanic Origin 773 1.1 7.9 Foreign-Born Residents 1.5 1.9 12.9 Tenure Owner Households 4,499 19.9 40.7 Renter Households 18,137 80.1 59.3 Population 5+ yrs in same house in 2000 as in 1995 30,019 51.8 46.9 Housing Occupancy Occupied Units 22,636 84.1 90.4 Vacant Units 4,272 15.9 9.6 Housing by Unit Type 1-unit detached 1,601 5.9 13.1 1-unit attached 6,114 22.7 26.4 2-4 units 4,003 14.9 11.0 5-9 units 5,299 19.7 8.0 10-19 units 7,819 29.1 10.3 20-49 units 615 2.2 7.4 50+ units 1,456 5.4 23.3 Mobile/ other 0 0 0.2 Figures noted with an asterisk are estimates developed by the Office of Planning and Department of Employment Services based on a variety of data sources Total population of subcategories may not match 2000 Census totals due to sampling errors. AREA ELEM ENTS COMPREHENSIVE PLAN DISTRICT ELEMENTS ADOPTED 12/19/06 P. 2-83 Income and Employment 1905 Information provided by the Department of Employment Services and the Office of Planning shows there were 21,800 jobs in the Far Southeast/ Southwest in 2005. Most are government related and are associated with the military and St. Elizabeths. As of the 2000 Census the median household income for the area was $23,290 per year, or about one-half the city’s median income of $45,927. 1905.1 In the fourth quarter of 2005, the unemployment rate in the Far Southeast/ Southwest was 13 percent. This was four times higher than the rate in Upper Northwest neighborhoods and more than three times the average for the Washington region. Data on commute patterns indicates that 31 percent of the employed residents in the Planning Area commuted to jobs in Central Washington. Some 8 percent worked within the Far Southeast/ Southwest Planning Area itself, and 34 percent commuted to jobs elsewhere in the city. 421 The remaining 26 percent commuted to Maryland or Virginia. 1905.2 Projections 1906 Based on land availability, recent development activity, planning policies, and regional growth trends, significant growth is expected during the next 20 years. The planning area is expected to grow from about 22,800 households in 2005 to 30,100 households in 2025, an increase of about 32 percent. By 2025, the area is expected to have a population of almost 82,000. While this is still fewer residents than the area had during the peak years of the 1950s, it marks a major turnaround after five decades of decline. The projections assume that vacant and abandoned housing units in the Planning Area will be refurbished or replaced, and that new units will be developed on vacant and underutilized sites. 1906.1 [PULLQUOTE: Based on land availability, recent development activity, planning policies, and regional growth trends, significant growth is expected during the next 20 years. The planning area is expected to grow from about 22,800 households in 2005 to 30,100 households in 2025, an increase of about 31 percent. Approximately 6,000 additional jobs are forecast in the Planning Area during the next two decades.] A period of sustained growth in the Planning Area has already started. Between 2000 and 2005, an astonishing 8,000 units of housing have been constructed or rehabilitated, including more than 1,000 new units in HOPE VI projects at the former Stanton Dwellings, Frederick Douglass Homes and Valley Green public housing developments. Future housing development is expected around the Anacostia and Congress Heights Metro stations, on the East Campus of St. Elizabeths Campus, at the now vacant Sheridan Terrace housing complex, and at Barry Farm. Infill development is also expected along Martin Luther King, Jr Avenue, South Capitol Street, and on scattered vacant sites. 1906.2 Approximately 6,000 additional jobs are forecast in the Planning Area during the next two decades. Future job centers include St. Elizabeths, DC Village, and the Anacostia Metrorail Station and Gateway areas.2 1906.3 2 These forecasts were prepared before the Department of Homeland Security announced its plans for the west campus of St. Elizabeths; consequently, actual employment growth in the Planning Area could significantly exceed 6,000 jobs. AREA ELEM ENTS COMPREHENSIVE PLAN DISTRICT ELEMENTS ADOPTED 12/19/06 P. 2-84 Planning and Development Priorities 1907 Three Comprehensive Plan workshops took place in the Far Southeast/ Southwest during 2005 and 2006. Many residents, Advisory Neighborhood Commissioners, and civic association leaders provided input at these meetings, discussing local planning issues and priorities. There have also been many meetings in the community not directly connected to the Comprehensive Plan, but focusing on other long-range planning issues. Topics such as the rebuilding of the 11th Street and South Capitol Street Bridges, development of Poplar Point, the redevelopment of Camp Simms and St. Elizabeths, and streetscape improvements for Martin Luther King, Jr. Avenue SE have all been addressed at public meetings in the last two years. 1907.1 Several important messages came across in these meetings, including: 1907.2 (a) An improved educational system, job and vocational training system, and social service safety net is essential to the area’s future. A 40 percent high school dropout rate is unacceptable—and the doubledigit unemployment that results in part from poor education also is unacceptable. Improved job training and adult education are essential to alleviate unemployment, under-employment, and poverty—and 422 additional facilities to house these services are needed. As noted elsewhere in the Comprehensive Plan, establishing a community college or branch campus of the University of the District of Columbia east of the Anacostia River could go a long way toward preparing youth and adults for good, quality jobs in the District’s economy. Good access to transit is essential to connect residents with jobs in the District and elsewhere in the region. [Photo caption: CVS Regional Learning Center and DC One-Stop Career Center on South Capitol Street] (b) The culture of drugs and violence still destroys the lives of too many youth and families in the community. While the root causes of this problem are complex, greater investment in schools, libraries, child care centers, recreation centers, parks, and health clinics provides an important start toward improved public safety. Many residents have advocated for improved public facilities and services; the development that is planned for this area over the next 20 years should be leveraged to make this a reality. The Anacostia and Washington Highlands Libraries must be reconstructed. Anacostia High, Ketcham, Birney, Savoy, Ballou, and other schools must be modernized. Public facility improvements should be the cornerstone of any revitalization or neighborhood economic development program in this area c) The Far Southeast/Southwest needs more housing suitable for families and young homeowners. The concentration of poverty in the community has resulted in part from the concentration of poorly maintained rental apartments and public housing, and few opportunities for home ownership. The established single family, row house, and duplex neighborhoods should be protected and enhanced. Additional low to moderate density housing should be encouraged as sites like St. Elizabeth’s (east campus) and Sheridan Terrace are redeveloped. In some areas, rezoning may be needed to promote the desired housing types—currently, much of the area is zoned “R-5-A” which perpetuates the garden apartment pattern d) The community recognizes that there are opportunities for increased density within the Planning Area—especially around the Metro stations at Anacostia and Congress Heights, at St. Elizabeths, and in neighborhood centers along Martin Luther King Junior Avenue and South Capitol Street. Transitoriented development in these areas can provide opportunities for seniors, households without cars, young renters, and others. Residents would like an array of housing choices, but believe that higher-density housing should be limited to the areas listed above. Beyond these areas, many residents have expressed AREA ELEM ENTS COMPREHENSIVE PLAN DISTRICT ELEMENTS ADOPTED 12/19/06 P. 2-85 the opinion that deteriorating apartment complexes should be replaced with less dense housing over time. In fact, this is what has happened at Frederick Douglass, Stanton Dwellings, and Valley Green, with public housing replaced by mixed income townhomes and detached units. Many residents asked that the remaining vacant sites in the community be planned and zoned for single family homes rather than more garden apartments e) Housing maintenance is a big issue in the Planning Area, and affects the lives of residents in many ways. Residents are concerned about rising costs—especially rising rents and property taxes. The demolition of much of the area’s public housing has displaced some long-time residents and created concerns about future redevelopment. There is an interest in preserving the affordability of some of the 423 area’s rental housing through rehabilitation and renovation. On the other hand, there are also concerns about lax code enforcement, unpermitted construction, and a continued need to clean up vacant and abandoned properties f) More retail services are needed in the community, especially supermarkets and sit-down restaurants. The community also needs basic services like full-service gas stations and hardware stores, so residents do not have to travel to Prince George’s County to shop. The Camp Simms Shopping Center is an important step in the right direction; additional investment should be made in the existing retail centers along Martin Luther King Jr Avenue, Good Hope Road, Alabama Road, and South Capitol Streets. Façade improvements, streetscape improvements, and upgraded public transit along these streets can help existing businesses, and promote new businesses—with the added benefit of creating new jobs for area residents. [PULLQUOTE: More retail services are needed in the community, especially supermarkets and sit- down restaurants. The community also needs basic services like full-service gas stations and hardware stores, so residents do not have to travel to Prince George’s County to shop.] (g) Traffic congestion is a problem—with much of the traffic generated by non-residents passing through the area or using local streets as short-cuts when I-295 is congested. Traffic “calming” measures are needed to reduce cut-through traffic, and to slow down speeding traffic and reduce unsafe driving. Public transit improvements also are needed. Approximately half of the area’s households do not own a car and rely on the Metrobus or Metrorail to get around. Residents are concerned that projects like the Anacostia streetcar will reduce bus service, especially across the Anacostia River h) Despite its proximity to the waterfront, much of the Far Southeast/Southwest is cut off from the Anacostia and Potomac Rivers. Access to the Potomac River is limited due to the uses along the shoreline (Bolling AFB and the Blue Plains treatment plant Anacostia River access is difficult due to the I-295 freeway, railroad tracks, and other barriers. Crossing the river on the South Capitol Street or 11th/12th Street bridges is difficult, if not impossible, for pedestrians and bicyclists. Better access to Poplar Point and Anacostia Park on the north, and to Oxon Cove on the south, should be achieved in the future. Historic Anacostia was born as a waterfront community and its identity as a waterfront community should be restored in the future. [PULLQUOTE: Despite its proximity to the waterfront, much of the Far Southeast/Southwest is cut off from the Anacostia and Potomac Rivers. Access to the Potomac River is limited due to the uses along the shoreline (Bolling AFB and the Blue Plains treatment plant).] (i) The Far Southeast/Southwest contains hilly topography. A prominent ridgeline crosses the area, affording great views of Washington and abundant natural scenery. In some cases development has been insensitive to topography, not only missing an opportunity for better design but also causing soil erosion AREA ELEM ENTS COMPREHENSIVE PLAN DISTRICT ELEMENTS ADOPTED 12/19/06 P. 2-86 and unnecessary grading and tree removal. The disregard for the natural environment also manifests itself in illegal dumping—a problem along Oxon Run, in other streambeds, and on vacant land throughout the 424 area. A cleaner environment, and preservation of the area’s natural beauty, are both high priorities. Policies and Actions FSS-1.0 General Policies FSS-1.1 Guiding Growth and Neighborhood Conservation 1908 The following general policies and actions should guide growth and neighborhood conservation decisions in the Far Southeast/Southwest. These policies and actions should be considered in tandem with those in the citywide elements of the Comprehensive Plan. 1908.1 Policy FSS-1.1.1: Directing Growth Concentrate future housing development and employment growth in the Far Southeast/Southwest around the Congress Heights and Anacostia Metro Stations, on the St. Elizabeths Hospital Campus, and along the “Great Streets” corridors of Martin Luther King, Jr. Avenue SE and South Capitol Street. Provide improved transit and automobile access to these areas and improve their visual and urban design qualities. 1908.2 Policy FSS-1.1.2: Conservation of Lower Density Neighborhoods Protect existing single family housing within the Far Southeast/Southwest by appropriately designating such areas as “Low Density Residential” on the Comprehensive Plan Future Land Use Map, and by zoning such areas for single family, rather than multi-family housing. 1908.3 Policy FSS-1.1.3: Rehabilitation of Multi-Family Housing Support rehabilitation and stronger and more consistent code enforcement for the many garden apartments in the Planning Area, particularly in Shipley Terrace, Knox Hill, and Washington Highlands. Support city programs which provide financial assistance to renovate such complexes, with the condition that a significant portion of the units are preserved as affordable after renovation. 1908.4 Policy FSS-1.1.4: Infill Housing Development Support infill housing development on vacant sites within the Far Southeast/Southwest, especially in Historic Anacostia, and in the Hillsdale, Fort Stanton, Bellevue, Congress Heights and Washington Highlands neighborhoods. 1908.5 Policy FSS-1.1.5: Transportation Improvements Undertake transportation improvements and design changes that reduce the amount of “cut through” commuter traffic on local streets. These changes should include new bridges over the Anacostia River, redesigned ramps, and better connections between Downtown, I-295, and Suitland Parkway. 1908.6 Policy FSS-1.1.6: Anacostia Streetcar Project Coordinate land use and transportation decisions along the proposed route of the Anacostia Streetcar between Bolling AFB and the Anacostia Gateway area. Future development along the streetcar line should be clustered around proposed transit stops. In addition, the streetcar route should be designed and planned to minimize impacts on traffic flow and to avoid negative impacts on the historic character of the Anacostia community. 1908.7 AREA ELEM ENTS COMPREHENSIVE PLAN DISTRICT ELEMENTS ADOPTED 12/19/06 P. 2-87 Policy FSS-1.1.7: Retail Development Support additional retail development within the Far Southeast/Southwest, especially in Historic Anacostia, and in the neighborhood centers at Malcolm X/ Martin Luther King Jr Avenue and South Capitol/ Atlantic. Projects which combine upper story housing or offices and ground floor retail are particularly encouraged in these three locations. 1908.8 Policy FSS-1.1.8: Supermarkets and Services Attract additional supermarkets, family-style restaurants, full-service gas stations, and general merchandise stores to the Far Southeast/Southwest. The area’s larger commercial sites should be marketed to potential investors, and economic and regulatory incentives should be used to attract 425 business. The upgrading and renovation of the area’s existing auto-oriented shopping centers is strongly encouraged. 1908.9 Policy FSS-1.1.9: Parking Support additional dedicated off-street parking and loading areas in the business districts at Martin Luther King, Jr Avenue/ Malcolm X Avenue, Alabama Avenue/ 23rd Street, and Historic Anacostia. Work with local merchants in each area to identify potential sites. 1908.10 Policy FSS-1.1.10: Minority/Small Disadvantaged Business Development Provide technical assistance to minority-owned and small businesses in the Far Southeast/Southwest to improve the range of goods and services available to the community. Joint venture opportunities, minority business set-asides, business incubator centers, and assistance to community-based development organizations should all be used to jumpstart local business and provide jobs in the community. 1908.11 Policy FSS-1.1.11: Workforce Development Centers Support the development of additional vocational schools, job training facilities, and workforce development centers. Encourage the retention of existing job training centers, and the development of new centers on such sites as the St. Elizabeth’s Campus and DC Village to increase employment opportunities for local residents. 1908.12 Policy FSS-1.1.12: Increasing Home Ownership Address the low rate of home ownership in the Far Southeast/Southwest by providing more owneroccupied housing in new construction, encouraging the construction of single family homes, and by supporting the conversion of rental apartments to owner-occupied housing, with an emphasis on units that are affordable to current tenants. 1908.13 Policy FSS-1.1.13: School Modernization Strongly support the modernization of schools in the Far Southeast/ Southwest Planning Area. Plans for additional housing must be accompanied by a commitment to improving educational facilities to meet current and future needs, and recognition that education is among the community’s highest priorities. [Photo Caption: Wheeler Creek] Action FSS-1.1-A: R-5-A Zoning Evaluate the continued appropriateness of the R-5-A zoning that occurs throughout the Far Southeast/Southwest Planning Area. Currently, this zoning applies to many row house, duplex, and single family areas within the community. Rezoning should be considered to better match existing character, and to ensure that future infill development is compatible. The use of R-5-A and other, more dense multi-family zones should continue in areas where multi-family development exists or is desirable in the future. 1908.14 AREA ELEM ENTS COMPREHENSIVE PLAN DISTRICT ELEMENTS ADOPTED 12/19/06 P. 2-88 Action FSS-1.1-B: Façade Improvements Implement urban design and façade improvements in the established commercial districts along Martin Luther King, Jr. Avenue SE, Good Hope Road SE and South Capitol Street SW. 1908.15 Action FSS-1.1-C: Retail Development Complete construction of the Camp Simms retail center by 2008 and support efforts to bring quality retail services to the site. 1908.16 Action FSS-1.1-D: UDC Satellite Campus Pursue the development of a satellite campus for University of the District of Columbia or another university (in consultation with local colleges and universities) either in this Planning Area or in the 426 adjacent Planning Area to the north. Possible sites could include vacated DC Public Schools, the St. Elizabeths Campus, Poplar Point, and the Anacostia Metro Station area. 1908.17 Action FSS-1.1-E: East of the River Development Zone Initiatives Continue implementation of the various East of the River Development Zone Initiatives, designed to foster housing and economic development along Alabama Avenue SE and Martin Luther King Jr Avenue (in Anacostia) through financial and tax incentives. 1908.18 Action FSS-1.1-F: Transportation Improvements Implement the recommendations of the Middle Anacostia Crossings Study, prepared by the District Department of Transportation in 2005. These recommendations include redesign of interchanges along I- 295 to reduce traffic congestion on surface streets in Historic Anacostia and its vicinity. 1908.19 Action FSS-1.1-G: Streetcar Extension Study the feasibility of extending the proposed Anacostia streetcar from Bolling Air Force Base south to DC Village and National Harbor. 1908.20 [Photo Caption: Martin Luther King Jr Avenue SE] FSS-1.2 Conserving and Enhancing Community Resources 1909 Policy FSS-1.2.1: Health Care Facilities Sustain and support existing health care facilities in Far Southwest/ Southeast and develop additional health care and social service facilities to respond to the urgent unmet need for primary care, pre- and post-natal care, child care, youth development, family counseling, and drug and alcohol treatment centers. Pursue co-location or consolidation of these facilities with other public facilities where possible, and where the uses are compatible. 1909.1 Policy FSS-1.2.2: Historic Resources Protect buildings of important significance in the Far Southeast/Southwest community, such as the old Anacostia Museum site (also known the Good Samaritan Foundation Support the designation of additional historic landmarks within the Far Southeast/Southwest neighborhoods. 1909.2 Policy FSS-1.2.3: Connecting To the River Reconnect the neighborhoods of the Far Southeast/Southwest to the Anacostia River, particularly through the redevelopment of Poplar Point, implementation of the Anacostia Waterfront Initiative park and trail improvements, and reconstruction of the Anacostia River bridges. 1909.3 AREA ELEM ENTS COMPREHENSIVE PLAN DISTRICT ELEMENTS ADOPTED 12/19/06 P. 2-89 Policy FSS -1.2.4: Designing With Nature Protect and enhance the wooded ridges and slopes of the Far Southeast/Southwest, particularly views of the monumental core of the city from the major north-south ridge that crosses the area. Development should be particularly sensitive to environmental features along the Oxon Run Parkway, Shepherd Parkway (along I-295 and on the St. Elizabeths and DC Village sites. 1909.4 Policy FSS-1.2.5: Fort Circle Parks Improve the Fort Circle Parks within the Far Southeast/Southwest, including upgrades to the Fort Circle Trail, and additional recreational facilities and amenities at Fort Stanton Park. 1909.5 [Photo Caption: View from Fort Stanton] Policy FSS-1.2.6: Soil Erosion Correct existing soil erosion problems in the Far Southeast/Southwest, particularly in Congress Heights, Buena Vista, and Washington Highlands, and ensure that new development mitigates potential impacts on soil stability. 1909.6 Policy FSS-1.2.7: Blue Plains Work with WASA to reduce foul odors at the Blue Plains Wastewater Treatment Plant. Land uses on DC 427 Village and elsewhere in the vicinity of the plant should be regulated in a way that limits the exposure of future residents to odors and other hazards associated with the plant. 1909.7 Action FSS-1.2-A: Oxon Run Trail Upgrade the Oxon Run Trail and extend it to Oxon Cove, consistent with the City’s Bicycle Master Plan. Develop additional trail links between Oxon Run, the Fort Circle Parks, and the Anacostia River. 1909.9 See the Anacostia Waterfront Element for additional policies on the Anacostia River and its parks, including Stickfoot Creek FSS-2.0 Policy Focus Areas 1910 The Comprehensive Plan has identified seven areas in the Far Southeast/Southwest as “Policy focus areas,” indicating that they require a level of direction and guidance above that in the prior section of this Area Element and in the citywide elements (see Map 19.1 and Table 19.2 These areas are: Historic Anacostia St. Elizabeths Campus Barry Farm/ Hillsdale/ Fort Stanton Congress Heights Metro Station Congress Heights Commercial District Bellevue/ Washington Highlands DC Village 1910.1 AREA ELEM ENTS COMPREHENSIVE PLAN DISTRICT ELEMENTS ADOPTED 12/19/06 P. 2-90 Table 19.2: Policy Focus Areas Within and Adjacent to Far Southeast/ Southwest 1910.2 Within Far Southeast/ Southw est 2.1 H istoric Anacostia (see p. 19-16) 2.2 St. Elizabeths Campus (see p. 19-19) 2.3 Barry Farm/ Hillsdale/ Fort Stanton (see p. 19-20) 2.4 Congress Heights Metro Station (see p. 19-22) 2.5 Congress Heights Commercial District (see p. 19-22) 2.6 Bellevue/ Washington Highlands (see p. 19-23) 2.7 DC Village (see p. 19-25) Adjacent to Far Southeast/ Southw est 1 Poplar Point (see p. 15-24) 2 Skyland (see p. 18-23) [INSERT Map 19.1: Far Southeast/ Southwest Policy Focus Areas 1910.3] FSS-2.1 Historic Anacostia 1911 Since the 1980s, much of the planning activity east of the Anacostia River has focused on Historic Anacostia. The area always has had symbolic importance, as it is the oldest area of continuous settlement east of the river and the gateway to the East of the River neighborhoods. Its narrow streets, wood- frame row houses, well-defined business district, and hilly terrain create the ambiance of a small historic mill town—yet is literally minutes away from the US Capitol. The extension of the Metrorail Green Line in the early 1990s made the area more accessible and has created opportunities for revival. 1911.1 Revitalization has been slow, but the area is on the cusp on positive change. The business district was designated as a DC Main Street in 2002, and commercial façade and streetscape improvements have been completed. The abandoned Nichols School has been beautifully refurbished and reopened as 428 Thurgood Marshall Academy. A new streetcar line is planned, and a new government center will soon break ground at the foot of the 11th and 12th Street bridges. Future development at Poplar Point and St. Elizabeths should also help Anacostia rebound. 1911.2 An Anacostia Transit-Area Strategic Investment and Development Plan was prepared in 2004 and 2005 to provide guidance on several key sites along the Martin Luther King Jr Avenue corridor from the 4- acre Metro station site on the south to the “gateway” at Good Hope Road on the north. The Plan proposes mixed use (residential and commercial) development on vacant sites, restoration of historic buildings, better ground floor retail, a return to two-way traffic on MLK Jr Avenue, and improved connections to AREA ELEM ENTS COMPREHENSIVE PLAN DISTRICT ELEMENTS ADOPTED 12/19/06 P. 2-91 parks and adjacent neighborhoods. Three distinct centers of activity are identified—these are summarized in Policy FSS-2.1.2 below. 1911.3 Policy FSS-2.1.1: Historic Anacostia Revitalization Encourage the continued revitalization of Historic Anacostia as a safe, walkable, and attractive neighborhood, with restored historic buildings and compatible, well-designed mixed use projects. New development should serve a variety of income groups and household types and should restore needed retail services to the community. 1911.4 Policy FSS-2.1.2: Activity Concentrations Concentrate development activity in Historic Anacostia at the following locations a) The Metro station, including the station site and the adjacent Bethelehem Baptist Church site, which should be developed with a mix of single and multi-family homes with ground floor retail b) The W Street/Martin Luther King Jr Avenue area, where diverse new housing opportunities and ground floor retail should be encouraged on parking lots and underutilized sites c) The Gateway area (at Good Hope Road where a government center is planned, and additional opportunities exist for residences, shops, offices, and arts uses. Densities and intensities should be compatible with the area’s historic character and should generally be in the moderate range, with medium density on the Metro station site. 1911.5 [Photo Caption: Historic Anacostia] Policy FSS-2.1.3: Pedestrian Connectivity Improve connections between the Anacostia Metro station, Poplar Point, Anacostia Park, Cedar Hill, the Good Hope Road area, and Hillsdale/ Fort Stanton, especially for pedestrians and transit users. 1911.6 Policy FSS-2.1.4: Historic Preservation Encourage continued historic preservation efforts in Anacostia, including the restoration of commercial facades along Martin Luther King Jr Avenue and Good Hope Road and the rehabilitation of older and historic residential and commercial buildings. 1911.7 Action FSS-2.1-A: Government Center Complete the Anacostia Gateway Government Center, which will include the headquarters for the District Department of Transportation, by 2008. Ensure that streetscape and landscape improvements take place concurrently. 1911.8 Action FSS-2.1-B: Transportation and Public Realm Improvements Implement the transportation improvements identified in the Anacostia Strategic Development and Investment Plan, including the Anacostia streetcar, pedestrian safety improvements, new landscaping and 429 street trees, improved signage, redesign of the Metrobus Plaza, and development of new off-street parking facilities. In addition, Martin Luther King, Jr. Avenue SE should be restored as a two-way street to improve retail accessibility. 1911.9 Action FSS-2.1-C: Public Facility Improvements Restore cultural and public facilities throughout Historic Anacostia, including Savoy and Burney Schools, the Anacostia Public Library, and the historic Carver Theater. 1911.10 Action FSS-2.1.4: 1900 Block of Martin Luther King, Jr. Avenue Ensure that future development on this block includes rehabilitation plans for the existing structures in order to preserve their historic character. 1911.11 AREA ELEM ENTS COMPREHENSIVE PLAN DISTRICT ELEMENTS ADOPTED 12/19/06 P. 2-92 See the Anacostia Transit Station Strategic Investment and Development Plan for additional detail. FSS-2.2 St. Elizabeths Hospital Campus 1912 The St. Elizabeths Campus contains 336 acres and is one of the most historically significant and strategically located properties in the entire District of Columbia. It is divided into a 154-acre East Campus under District control, and a 183-acre West Campus under Federal control. The East Campus was transferred to the District by the federal government in 1987 and continues to be used as a mental health facility. In 2006, it housed about 500 patients. In 2003, the District constructed a new Unified Communications Center on a portion of the site. Construction is now starting on a new psychiatric hospital, freeing up the remainder of the site for other uses. 1912.1 A Framework Plan for the East Campus was completed in 2005. The Plan recommends up a phased development program, with up to 1,035 additional housing units, 540,000 square feet of office and retail space, new academic and cultural facilities, and new city parks and plazas. Adaptive reuse of many of the existing buildings is proposed. The Plan takes particular care to integrate the East Campus into the adjacent Congress Heights neighborhood, and to maximize access to the Congress Heights Metro station. Four development areas have been identified, each defined by a unique mix of uses, density, scale, and character. An extensive network of public open space also is proposed, including formal plazas and quadrangles, linear parks, lawns, and forested land. 1912.2 [PULLQUOTE: A Framework Plan for the East Campus was completed in 2005. The Plan recommends up a phased development program, with up to 1,035 additional housing units, 540,000 million square feet of office and retail space, new academic and cultural facilities, and new city parks and plazas.] The fate of the West Campus has been in flux for more than a decade. Many of the site’s historic buildings are in disrepair and will require costly renovation. In 2005, the federal government announced its intent to develop the site as a secured office complex for the US Coast Guard. Other divisions of the federal department of Homeland Security also may relocate there; current estimates call for between 4,000 and 14,000 federal employees. Improvements to the road and transit network will be required as this area redevelops. Great care must be taken to retain the historic proportions of the site and its buildings and landscapes. The General Services Administration is in the process of doing a master plan for the West Campus. 1912.3 Policy FSS-2.2.1: St. Elizabeths East Campus Redevelop the East Campus of St. Elizabeths Hospital as a new community containing a mix of uses, including mixed density housing, retail shops, offices, a comprehensive mental health care facility, and 430 parks and open space. Other uses such as satellite college campuses, civic uses, and local public facilities should be incorporated. 1912.4 [St. Elizabeths Hospital Campus] Policy FSS-2.2.2: St. Elizabeths West Campus Work collaboratively with the federal government on the reuse of the West Campus. Particular priority should be given to preserve historic resources—including not only the buildings, but the historic open spaces and massing of buildings on the site. To the greatest extent feasible, redevelopment of the West Campus should create new publicly accessible open space and should be coordinated with redevelopment of the East Campus. 1912.5 AREA ELEM ENTS COMPREHENSIVE PLAN DISTRICT ELEMENTS ADOPTED 12/19/06 P. 2-93 Policy FSS-2.2.3: Relationship To Nearby Uses Ensure that future development on St. Elizabeths enhances the surrounding neighborhood. It is particularly important that the site’s reuse is coordinated with planning for the nearby Anacostia and Congress Heights Metro Stations, Poplar Point, Barry Farm, and the Martin Luther King Jr Avenue Malcolm X shopping district. 1912.6 Policy FSS-2.2.4: Development Density Provide development densities and intensities on the site that are compatible with adjacent residential neighborhoods—with moderate to medium density residential and commercial on most of the site, with higher densities clustered in the area closest to the Congress Heights Metrorail station. 1912.7 Action FSS-2.2-A: St. Elizabeths East Campus Framework Plan Complete the Framework Plan for the East Campus of St. Elizabeths Hospital and submit it to the DC Council as a Small Area Plan. 1912.8 Action FSS-2.2-B: New St. Elizabeths Hospital Complete construction of the new 300-bed facility on the east campus of St. Elizabeths Hospital to house mentally ill patients, while maintaining current service levels for outpatient treatment. 1912.9 FSS-2.3 Barry Farm, Hillsdale, and Fort Stanton 1913 The neighborhoods of Barry Farm, Hillsdale, and Fort Stanton are sandwiched between Historic Anacostia on the north and the St. Elizabeths Campus and Suitland Parkway on the South. While these three neighborhoods are currently home to more than 8,000 residents, they also contain some of the largest vacant sites east of the Anacostia River. For example, the 9-acre Sheridan Terrace site has sat vacant since 1996, when the apartment complex that once stood there was demolished. The Focus Area includes one of the city’s largest public housing complexes at Barry Farm, the historic Fort Stanton Park, and the Smithsonian Institution Anacostia Museum. Topography in the area is hilly, affording panoramic views of the central city. 1913.1 [Photo Caption: Barry Farm] This area has been called out in the Area Element for three reasons. First, Barry Farm has been identified as a potential “new community” and policies are needed to guide future change. Second, policies are needed to ensure that development is sensitive to the hilly terrain and the area’s established moderate to low density character. Third, policies should ensure that this area is better connected to the fast- changing areas on the north and south, with improved access to transit, parks, jobs, public facilities, and retail services. Barry Farm, Hillsdale, and Fort Stanton should not be left behind as the areas around them move forward. 1913.2 Policy FSS-2.3.1: Barry Farm New Community 431 Encourage the revitalization of Barry Farm in a manner which a) Ensures one-for-one replacement of any public housing that is removed, along with measures to assist residents and avoid dislocation or personal hardship b) Creates additional opportunities for workforce and market rate housing on the site, consistent with the goals of the city’s New Communities program c) Provides new amenities such as community facilities, parks, and improved access to the Anacostia River and Anacostia Metro Station. While some increase in density will be required to meet the one-for-one replacement requirement, consideration should be given to including nearby vacant land into the New Community site, so that densities may remain in the moderate to medium range. 1913.3 AREA ELEM ENTS COMPREHENSIVE PLAN DISTRICT ELEMENTS ADOPTED 12/19/06 P. 2-94 Policy FSS-2.3.2: Housing Opportunities Encourage compatible infill development on vacant and underutilized land within the Hillsdale and Fort Stanton neighborhoods, with an emphasis on low to moderate density housing designed for families. Special care should be taken to respect the area’s topography, avoid erosion, improve the street and circulation system, and mitigate any traffic increases caused by new development. 1913.4 Policy FSS-2.3.3: Connections To Adjacent Areas Improve pedestrian and road connections between the Barry Farm, Hillsdale, and Fort Stanton communities, and between these communities and the future developments at Poplar Point and the St. Elizabeths Campus. Residents should be able to safely walk or bicycle to the Anacostia Metro station, Anacostia Park, and Fort Stanton Park. 1913.5 Action FSS-2.3-A: Sheridan Terrace Consider adding the vacant Sheridan Terrace public housing site and other nearby vacant sites to the Barry Farm New Community proposal, in order to improve the economic viability of the proposal and ensure that mixed income, family-oriented housing can be provided. 1913.6 FSS-2.4 Congress Heights Metro Station 1914 The Congress Heights Metrorail Station is the last station on the Metrorail Green Line before leaving the District of Columbia. The station itself is about five acres in size and consists of a surface parking lot and subway entrance. Its location on the southeastern edge of the St. Elizabeths Campus makes it a critical part of the hospital redevelopment plans, and suggests it will become an increasingly important gateway to the area in the coming years. Land uses in the immediate vicinity include Malcolm X Elementary School, a Police sub-station, apartment complexes, single family homes, and an historic Jewish cemetery. Major projects within a half-mile of the station include the 600-unit Henson Ridge development and the Camp Simms shopping center and housing development. 1914.1 The Station itself is one of the newest in the Metro system, having opened in 2001. Passenger volumes are currently the lowest in the city. The station itself presents an important joint development opportunity, with the potential for new housing, retail, public, and open space uses, as well as Metro parking and bus transfer points. Future development will need to establish appropriate transitions to nearby uses, which are generally low to moderate density. Additional community-based planning for the area is needed to determine the right mix of uses and to address a variety of land use, transportation, and urban design issues in the Congress Heights community. 1914.2 [Photo Caption: Congress Heights Metro station site] Policy FSS-2.4.1: Congress Heights Metro Station Mixed Use Encourage reuse of the Congress Heights Metro station site with mixed use moderate density residential 432 and commercial development. Development on the site should be compatible with the adjacent lower density neighborhood to the west and south, provide a connection to the future development on the St. Elizabeths Campus, and create a stronger sense of identity and gateway for the Congress Heights neighborhood. 1914.3 Action FSS-2.4-A: Congress Heights Small Area Plan Prepare a Small Area Plan for the Congress Heights Metrorail Station and the surrounding Congress Heights neighborhood. The Plan should include more specific detail on the market for different uses on the site; the desired scale, mix, and intensity of development; future circulation patterns; and provisions for open space and public facilities. 1914.4 AREA ELEM ENTS COMPREHENSIVE PLAN DISTRICT ELEMENTS ADOPTED 12/19/06 P. 2-95 FSS-2.5 Congress Heights Commercial District 1915 This Policy Focus Area extends along Martin Luther King, Jr. Avenue from the edge of the St. Elizabeths Campus south to the intersection of South Capitol Street. Land uses are mostly commercial between St. Elizabeths and Alabama Avenue and residential between Alabama Avenue and South Capitol. There are a range of other uses along this mile-long corridor, including churches, non-profits, and health clinics. The heart of the area is the intersection of Malcolm X Avenue and Martin Luther King, Jr. Avenue, which is the main commercial center for the Congress Heights community. 1915.1 Previous Comprehensive Plans for the city have identified this business district for revitalization, and a number of city and non-profit initiatives have been launched to assist in its renewal. In 2005, the corridor was named as part of the city’s Great Streets program. Its proximity to the redeveloping St. Elizabeths Campus means that that it will continue to be an important center of neighborhood commerce. Efforts to strengthen and revitalize the corridor should continue, with infill development creating opportunities for new business and housing. 1915.2 Policy FSS-2.5.1: Martin Luther King, Jr/ Malcolm X Business District Encourage new commercial and small, local business development in the shopping area at Martin Luther King Jr Avenue and Malcolm X Avenue. Strengthen this area as the commercial hub of the Congress Heights neighborhood, and upgrade the mix of uses to better meet neighborhood needs. 1915.3 Policy FSS-2.5.2: Great Street Housing Opportunities Pursue opportunities for additional multi-family housing, possibly with ground floor retail or office uses, along the Martin Luther King Jr Avenue corridor between St. Elizabeths Hospital and Alabama Avenue. 1915.4 Policy FSS-2.5.3: Business Improvement Support the continued efforts of local merchants to improve the Congress Heights shopping district, provide adequate off-street parking and loading areas, manage on-street parking more effectively, and enhance building facades and storefronts. 1915.5 Action FSS-2.5-A: Coordination with St. Elizabeths Development Coordinate planning and reinvestment activities along the Martin Luther King Jr Avenue corridor with planning and development of the St. Elizabeths Campus. Recognize the opportunity for new businesses and services to meet the future demand created by new jobs and housing on the former Hospital site. 433 1915.6 Action FSS-2.5-B: Main Street Designation Consider the designation of the Martin Luther King Jr Avenue commercial district as a Main Street under the District’s Main Streets program. 1915.7 [Photo Caption: Congress Heights commercial district] FSS-2.6 Bellevue/ Washington Highlands 1916 The Bellevue commercial district includes several blocks around the intersection of South Capitol and Atlantic Streets. The area is a traditional neighborhood center, including small retailers, a bank, food and liquor stores, a gas station, personal services, a drugstore/training center for pharmacy technicians, and a Department of Employment Services (DOES) branch office. It includes the former Atlantic Theater and AREA ELEM ENTS COMPREHENSIVE PLAN DISTRICT ELEMENTS ADOPTED 12/19/06 P. 2-96 the Washington Highlands Library, and is adjacent to the new campus of Patterson Elementary School. 1916.1 In 2002, the area was designated a Strategic Neighborhood Improvement Program (SNIP) area by the District. The program’s goals were to improve the area's commercial and retail opportunities, increase home ownership and housing choices, improve the quality of infrastructure, enhance workforce and youth development opportunities, and promote public safety. A local advisory committee was created to prepare recommendations as part of this process. These included buying vacant homes for resale to nonprofit developers; improving streets, sidewalks, and infrastructure; repaving the street; and upgrading public facilities such as the library. Efforts to strengthen South Capitol/ Atlantic as a neighborhood center should continue in the future. South Capitol is part of the city’s Great Streets program and has been targeted for additional investment and economic development. 1916.2 The neighborhoods surrounding the commercial district include a large number of garden apartments, many in deteriorating condition. Some of these apartments were quickly constructed during the boom years of the 1940s and may need replacement or substantial renovation during the coming years. The policies below ensure that neighborhood character will be enhanced and that housing choices will be retained as these changes take place. 1916.3 [Photo Caption: Bellevue shopping district] Policy FSS-2.6.1: Neighborhood Shopping Improvements Encourage new commercial development and adaptive reuse of existing commercial buildings in the South Capitol/Atlantic Streets commercial district. Development should provide improved commercial goods and services to the surrounding Bellevue and Washington Highlands neighborhoods. 1916.4 Policy FSS-2.6.2: Business Improvement Support the continued efforts of local merchants to improve the Bellevue shopping district, provide adequate off-street parking and loading areas, and enhance building facades and storefronts. 1916.5 Policy FSS-2.6.3: Bellevue-Washington Highlands Infill Encourage refurbishment and/or replacement of deteriorating apartment complexes within Bellevue and Washington Highlands. Where buildings are removed, encourage their replacement with mixed income housing, including owner-occupied single family homes and townhomes as well as new apartments. Every effort shall be made to avoid resident displacement when such actions are taken, and to provide existing residents with opportunities to purchase their units or find suitable housing in the community. 1916.6 434 Action FSS-2.6-A: Great Street Improvements Implement the Great Street Plan to beautify South Capitol Street, maintaining the width of the street and landscaping it from Martin Luther King, Jr Avenue to the Maryland border. 1916.7 Action FSS-2.6-B: Merchants Association Encourage local merchants in the South Capitol/ Atlantic shopping district to form a merchants association to address issues such as the reuse of the Atlantic Theater. 1916.8 Action FSS-2.6-C: Washington Highlands Library Consider joint public-private development opportunities to reconstruct the Washington Highlands library, providing the Bellevue and Washington Highlands neighborhoods with a first class, state-of-the art public library. 1916.9 AREA ELEM ENTS COMPREHENSIVE PLAN DISTRICT ELEMENTS ADOPTED 12/19/06 P. 2-97 FSS-2.7 DC Village 1917 The 167-acre District of Columbia Village tract lies between Martin Luther King, Jr. Avenue and I- 295, east of the Blue Plains Wastewater Plant, just south of Bellevue. The site houses an eclectic mix of city operations, including training facilities for the Police and Fire Departments, an impound lots for towed cars, an evidence warehouse, and a District-operated homeless shelter. Other public uses, including the greenhouses of the Architect of the Capitol and the Potomac Job Corps Center are located on the site. The National Park Service controls the forested land on the perimeter of the site, including Oxon Cove to the south. 1917.1 DC Village provides a vital resource for local government operations, but the site is poorly laid out. It is physically isolated from the rest of the city, and its internal street pattern is confusing and hard to navigate. Abandoned structures, weed-covered lots, winding streets, and semi-industrial uses create the impression of a forgotten backwater. The District and surrounding Ward 8 community have wrestled with the site’s future for years. It was designated a “Development Zone” in 1986 and a “Special Treatment Area” by the previous Comprehensive Plan. Various uses have been considered over the years, including a 700-unit housing development, an industrial park, and even a prison (on the land to the south near Oxon Cove 1917.2 While there may be room for other uses on the site in the long term, the immediate priority is to reorganize existing uses and use the land more efficiently for District operations. DC Village is facing pressure to accommodate uses being displaced from the Anacostia Waterfront and other redeveloping areas. The site should be master planned and reorganized, with circulation improvements, higher design standards, and refurbishment or replacement of vacant buildings 1917.3 [Photo Caption: DC Village] Policy FSS-2.7.1: Retention of DC Village for Municipal Uses Retain DC Village as a municipal facility that accommodates activities and functions that are vital to the operation of District government. The organization of uses on the site should be improved so that it is used more efficiently and can function more effectively. 1917.4 Policy FSS-2.7.2: Non-Government Activities at DC Village As existing activities at DC Village are reorganized, consider the potential for other employment uses on the site, such as small business incubators and light industry. Such uses should not be accommodated at the expense of District government operations, and only should be allowed if the land is not essential 435 for municipal purposes. Any future private uses on the site should be compatible with the existing quasiindustrial municipal uses. Every effort should be made to link future jobs on the DC Village site to residents in East of the River neighborhoods, in order to assist residents in gaining income and work experience. 1917.5 [PULLQUOTE: Every effort should be made to link future jobs on the DC Village site to residents in East of the River neighborhoods, in order to assist residents in gaining income and work experience.] Policy FSS-2.7.3: Open Space around DC Village Retain the National Park Service land on the perimeter of DC Village as open space. The forested land south of the site around Oxon Cove should not be developed. 1917.6 Policy FSS-2.7.4: Retention of Job Training Activities Retain job training programs and facilities on the DC Village site, including the Potomac Job Corps Center, and promote participation in these programs by Far Southeast/ Southwest residents. 1917.7 AREA ELEM ENTS COMPREHENSIVE PLAN DISTRICT ELEMENTS ADOPTED 12/19/06 P. 2-98 Action ASE 2.7-A: DC Village Master Plan Prepare a master plan for the DC Village site, addressing the organization of uses on the site, access and circulation standards, environmental improvements, and urban design. The Plan should be linked to the Public Facilities Master Plan called for else where in the Comprehensive Plan, and should ensure that sufficient land is retained for municipal activities. 1917.8 AREA ELEM ENTS COMPREHENSIVE PLAN DISTRICT ELEMENTS ADOPTED 12/19/06 P. 2-99 CHAPTER 19 LOWER ANACOSTIA WATERFRONT/ NEAR SOUTHWEST AREA ELEMENT [Citations to be changed to Section 19, with “Overview” renumbered 1900, and so on] Overview 1500 The Lower Anacostia/ Near Southwest Waterfront Planning Area encompasses 3.0 square miles of land located along both sides of the Anacostia River in the southwest and southeast quadrants of the District of Columbia. Its boundaries are shown in the Map to the left. This Planning Area includes parts of Council Wards 6, 7, and 8. In the past, portions of this Planning Area have also been in Ward 2. 1500.1 The Anacostia waterfront is Washington’s great frontier for the 21st century. Much of its shoreline is on the cusp of being transformed from a landscape of industrial, transportation, and government uses to one of new mixed use neighborhoods, workplaces, civic spaces, parks, and restored natural areas. Established waterfront neighborhoods stand to benefit greatly as this transformation occurs, with improved access to the shoreline, new recreational amenities, new housing and transportation choices, and a cleaner natural environment. 1500.2 Land uses along the Anacostia waterfront are diverse. The shoreline currently includes wetlands and large open spaces, marinas, power plants, housing, commercial centers, and industry. The Anacostia Waterfront Planning Area includes the residential neighborhoods of Southwest and Near Southeast/ Carrollsburg. Its parks and open spaces include Anacostia Park, Poplar Point, and Hains Point, as well as historic squares and playgrounds in the residential areas. The area also includes federal military installations such as Fort McNair and the Washington Navy Yard, and local public facilities such schools 436 and recreation centers. It also includes Southeastern University, a business-oriented university catering to the educational needs of many District residents. 1500.3 As noted in the Citywide Elements, the Anacostia River itself has suffered from neglect. It has long been Washington’s “second river” lagging far behind the Potomac in visibility, image, public investment, and environmental clean-up. Runoff from the 176-square mile Anacostia River watershed, most of which is in Maryland, has polluted surface waters and compromised wetlands. This in turn affects water quality in the Lower Potomac River and the Chesapeake Bay. 1500.5 Conditions along the river will change dramatically as the Anacostia Framework Plan is implemented. The Framework Plan, which was adopted by the DC Council in 2004 as part of the legislation creating the Anacostia Waterfront Corporation, lays out a strategy for improving water quality, restoring habitat, and improving shoreline parks so that the waterfront becomes the centerpiece for new and revitalized communities. A network of trails, paths, and reconstructed bridges will help mend the divide that the river has come to symbolize in Washington. The objective is not only to connect the east and west shorelines, but to connect the city itself through great parks, public places, and new neighborhoods along a restored river. 1500.6 [Photo Caption: View down river, Pennsylvania Avenue (Sousa Bridge) in foreground] The Anacostia Waterfront Corporation (AWC) is leading the revitalization of lands along the river and coordinating environmental and programming initiatives that promote river clean up, public awareness, and waterfront recreation. Restoring the river’s natural environment is a central part of the AWC’s mission. 1500.7 AREA ELEM ENTS COMPREHENSIVE PLAN DISTRICT ELEMENTS ADOPTED 12/19/06 P. 2-100 The waterfront area is already experiencing substantial change. Since 2000, millions of square feet of office space have been constructed in the Near Southeast and hundreds of new residential units have been built. Former public housing at Arthur Capper-Carrollsburg is being replaced by new mixed income housing, with one-for-one replacement of every public housing unit removed. Redevelopment has been accompanied by vast improvements in housing quality, public safety, and project design. Groundbreaking for the new Washington National’s baseball stadium took place in early 2006. Projects on surrounding sites will transform this area into a new destination for visitors and residents from all parts of the region, nation, and world. 1500.8 Other planned improvements include a 70-acre public park at Poplar Point, an Interpretive Nature Center at a newly accessible Kingman Island, the Washington Canal Blocks Park in Near Southeast, and mixed use development in the Southwest Waterfront, Southeast Federal Center, Carrollsburg, and Poplar Point neighborhoods. Plans for these areas have been prepared in a broader context, taking into consideration “upriver” sites such as Reservation 13 and Parkside. Throughout the Planning Area and in the adjacent areas of Capitol Hill, Upper Northeast, and Far Northeast/ Southeast, neighborhoods will be better connected to the river by extending streets to the waterfront, adding waterfront promenades, and providing new forms of transportation such as water taxis. Rebuilding of the South Capitol 437 Street/Frederick Douglass Bridge and the 11th 12th Street bridges will change the visual profile of the waterfront and make pedestrian and bicycle crossings safer and easier. 1500.9 Context History 1501 The Anacostia watershed contains lush habitat and diverse ecosystems, which in pre-colonial times supported the Nacotchtank Indians. In the early years of European settlement, the river was known as the “Eastern Branch” of the Potomac. It formed the edge of the federal city, and was the terminus of important radial avenues extending out from the U.S. Capitol in the 1791 L’Enfant Plan. 1501.1 In 1799, the Washington Navy Yard was established about a mile south of the U.S. Capitol. It became the main port for receiving materials to construct the new city’s monumental buildings. Wharves and fisheries were established along the shoreline, and ocean-going vessels enjoyed a navigable channel up to the port of Bladensburg, Maryland. By the mid-1800s, development around the Navy Yard extended across the river via the 11st Street Bridge to Historic Anacostia (then called Uniontown Working class housing for Navy workers and others employed at the docks and nearby industrial areas was developed. 1501.2 By the time of the Civil War, tobacco farming, clear-cutting of forests, and industrial activities had silted and polluted the Anacostia. The river shrank from depths of 40 feet to barely eight feet, making it too shallow for navigation by sea-bound vessels. The Navy Yard built its last large ship in 1876. After the War, the large tobacco plantations that had dominated the landscape along the Anacostia River were broken up into smaller farms or abandoned. The blue collar settlements around the Navy Yard included a large population of freed slaves, beginning a long history of African-American neighborhoods along the river. 1501.3 [PULLQUOTE:By the time of the Civil War, tobacco farming, clear-cutting of forests, and industrial activities had silted and polluted the Anacostia.

The Navy Yard built its last large ship in 1876.] With the construction of Washington’s sewer system in the 1880s, water quality in the Anacostia River continued to deteriorate. The tidal wetlands were the source of mosquito-borne malaria outbreaks and were prone to periodic flooding. In 1901, the Senate Parks Commission suggested (through the McMillan Plan) that riverfront open space be constructed as means of improving public health conditions and creating parkland. Between 1902 and 1926, the US Army Corps of Engineers filled in wetlands and mud flats, and constructed seawalls along the riverbanks in order to create Anacostia Park. Tons of dredged river bottom were used to create Kingman and Heritage Islands. However, the McMillan Plan vision of a grand interconnected public park system was never realized. 1501.4 For most of the 20th century, the Anacostia waterfront continued to be the location for unwanted land uses and neglectful land management practices. Landfilling of the marshes and wetlands continued through the 1930s and 1940s. Most of the tributaries were re-routed into storm drains, further compromising the ecosystem and health of the river. 1501.5 438 After World War II, significant population growth in the watershed affected both the river and the waterfront neighborhoods. While direct dumping into the river was curbed, highway building and development in the 176-square mile watershed led to continued pollution from stormwater runoff. Neighborhoods near the Southwest waterfront deteriorated further and finally were declared “obsolete” by planning documents of the early 1950s. Plans to rehabilitate the housing in an incremental manner were passed over in favor of more dramatic plans to clear and rebuild the entire community. These plans ultimately resulted in the largest urban renewal project in the United States. Thousands of mostly poor, African-American families were displaced and connections to the waterfront were further eroded by the new Southeast/Southwest Freeway. 1501.6 By the 1970s, a grass roots movement to save the Anacostia River was gaining momentum. This movement grew during the 1980s and 1990s, as groups like the Chesapeake Bay Foundation and the Anacostia Watershed Society advocated for the restoration of the city’s “forgotten” river and improvements to its watershed to reduce pollution. Initiatives and mandates to clean the Chesapeake Bay and implement federal water quality programs provided further impetus for action. In March, 2000, Mayor Anthony Williams and 20 different agencies controlling land or having jurisdiction over the Anacostia shoreline signed the Anacostia Waterfront Initiative Memorandum of Understanding (MOU The MOU led to the production and completion of the Anacostia Waterfront Framework Plan in November 2003. The Framework Plan is intended to guide the revitalization of the waterfront and its shoreline communities for decades to come. 1501.7 Land Use 1502 Land use statistics for the Anacostia Waterfront Planning Area appear in Figure 19.1. The area includes 1,884 acres of land and 1,295 acres of water. The Planning Area represents about 5 percent of the District of Columbia’s land area. 1502.1 [INSERT Figure 15.1: Land Use Composition in the Anacostia Waterfront Area 1502.3] [Pie Chart “slices” adjusted to reflect September 2006 changes to Planning Area boundaries: Residential-9 Comm/Ind-9 Federal-22 Streets-25 Public Facilities-3 Open Space-28 Institutional-1 Vacant-3%] About 75 percent of the Planning Area is in public ownership. Almost 30 percent of the Planning Area consists of parks and open space. Much of this land is adjacent to the waterfront and is under the AREA ELEM ENTS COMPREHENSIVE PLAN DISTRICT ELEMENTS ADOPTED 12/19/06 P. 2-102 jurisdiction of the National Park Service Street rights of way are the second largest land use, representing about 25 percent of the total area. Non-park federal uses represent 22 percent of the land area, including Fort McNair and the Navy Yard. 1502.2 Residential uses account for just nine percent of the land area and are concentrated in Southwest DC. Commercial and industrial uses comprise about nine percent of the Planning Area and are primarily located at Buzzard Point, along the Southwest Waterfront, in the near Southeast, and at Waterside Mall. 1502.4 Public facilities comprise three percent of the area. Institutional uses comprise about one percent of the area. Approximately 51 acres – just under three percent of the Planning Area – consists of vacant, unimproved private land. 1502.5 Demographics 1503 Basic demographic data for the Anacostia Waterfront is shown in Table 19.1. In 2000, the area had a population of almost 16,000 or about 2.8 percent of the city’s total. The number of residents in the area dropped slightly between 1990 and 2000. In 2005, the population is estimated to be 14,700, with the recent decline driven by the demolition of the 758-unit Arthur Capper-Carrollsburg public housing 439 project and a slight decline in household size. Average household size in 2005 is estimated to be 1.78 which is lower than the city average of 2.12. Average household size has been dropping in the Anacostia Waterfront as it has in other neighborhoods across the city. It was 1.97 in 1990. The decline is likely to continue in the future as much of the planned residential development consists of higher density housing with smaller units. 1503.1 Approximately 68 percent of the area’s residents are African-American, which is higher than the citywide average of 60 percent. Only about four percent of the area’s residents are of Hispanic origin, and almost nine percent are foreign born. Relative to the city as a whole, the area about the same percentage of children (20 percent The area’s percentage of seniors is 13 percent, compared to 12 percent citywide. 1503.2 Diversity is one of the strengths of the Lower Waterfront community. The Southwest neighborhood, in particular, is one of the most racially and economically diverse areas in the District of Columbia. The neighborhood is a microcosm of the city at large; this is one of the defining characteristics of the community and it is highly valued by residents. 1503.3 AREA ELEM ENTS COMPREHENSIVE PLAN DISTRICT ELEMENTS ADOPTED 12/19/06 P. 2-103 Table 19.1: Lower Anacostia Waterfront/ Near Southwest at a Glance 1503.3 Basic Statistics Land Area (square miles) 3.0 Population 1990 16,531 2000 15,822 2005 (estimated 14,700 2025 (projected 33,100 Households (2005 8,100 Household Population (2005 exclu des grou p qu arters 14,400 Persons Per Household (2005 1.78 Jobs (2005 32,500 Density (persons per sq mile 2005 4,900 Year 2000 Census Data Profile Lower Waterfront Planning Area Citywide Total of Total of Total Age Under 18 3,258 20.6 20.0 18-65 10,495 66.3 67.8 Over 65 2,069 13.1 12.2 Residents Below Poverty Level 4,380 27.7 20.2 Racial Composition White 3,853 24.4 30.4 Black 10,690 67.6 60.3 Native American 39 0.3 0.3 Asian/ Pacific Islander 319 2.0 2.6 Other 340 2.2 2.8 Multi-Racial 581 3.7 5.2 Hispanic Origin 637 4.0 7.9 Foreign-Born Residents 1,338 8.5 12.9 Tenure Owner Households 2,409 28.2 40.7 Renter Households 6,114 71.8 59.3 Population 5+ yrs in same house in 2000 as in 1995 7,098 47.7 46.9 Housing Occupancy Occupied Units 8,523 92.5 90.4 Vacant Units 686 7.5 9.6 Housing by Unit Type 1-unit detached 143 1.6 13.1 1-unit attached 2,009 21.8 26.4 2-4 units 467 5.1 11.0 5-9 units 661 7.2 8.0 10-19 units 123 1.3 10.3 20-49 units 450 4.9 7.4 440 50+ units 5,137 55.8 23.3 Mobile/ other 219 2.4 0.2 Figures noted with an asterisk are estimates developed by the Office of Planning and Department of Employment Services based on a variety of data sources Total population of subcategories may not match 2000 Census totals due to sampling errors. AREA ELEM ENTS COMPREHENSIVE PLAN DISTRICT ELEMENTS ADOPTED 12/19/06 P. 2-104 Housing Characteristics 1504 A majority of the housing stock in the Anacostia Waterfront Planning Area is contained in multi- family buildings. The 2000 Census reported that about 56 percent of the housing stock was located in buildings with 50 or more units, which is more than twice the citywide proportion of 23 percent. About one- quarter of the area’s housing stock consists of rowhouses and townhomes, which is similar to the citywide average. However, the proportion of single family detached homes in the Anacostia Waterfront Planning Area is less than two percent, which is substantially less than the citywide average of 13 percent. 1504.1 The Planning Area has more than 220 dwelling units in the “Other” category reported by the US Census, corresponding mainly to houseboats and live-aboards. These represent 2.4 percent of the Area’s housing units. 1504.2 In 2000, 7.5 percent of the units in the Anacostia Waterfront Planning Area were vacant. The percentage of vacant units is comparable to the city as a whole. Approximately 48 percent of the area’s residents resided in the same house in 2000 as they did in 1995, which is also comparable to the citywide average. 1504.3 Income and Employment 1505 Data from the Department of Employment Services and the Office of Planning indicates there were approximately 32,500 jobs in the Anacostia Waterfront Area in 2005. This represents four percent of the city’s job base. According to the 2000 Census, about 40 percent of the jobs in the Planning Area were filled by Maryland residents and about 38 percent were filled by Virginia residents. Only about 22 percent were filled by District residents. 1505.1 [PULLQUOTE: According to the 2000 Census, about 40 percent of the jobs in the Planning Area were filled by Maryland residents and about 38 percent were filled by Virginia residents. Only about 22 percent were filled by District residents.] Most employed residents in the Anacostia Waterfront commute to jobs elsewhere in the city and region, with about 40 percent commuting to Central Washington, 26 percent commuting elsewhere in the District of Columbia, 27 percent commuting to Maryland and Virginia, and only seven percent working within the Anacostia Waterfront Planning Area. As of the 2000 Census, median household income in the Planning Area was $33,516, compared to a citywide median of $45,927. Approximately 27 percent of the residents lived below the federal poverty line, compared to a citywide average of 20 percent. 1505.2 Projections 1506 Based on land availability, planning policies, and regional growth trends, the Anacostia Waterfront area is projected to more than double its population between 2005 and 2025. The Planning Area is expected 441 to grow from 8,100 households in 2005 to 17,500 households in 2025, with a projected increase in population from 14,700 to 33,100. Much of the growth is expected to consist of moderate to high density residential development along the Washington Channel and Near Southeast, and on the east side of the waterfront atPoplar Point. The Waterfront Planning Area represents 17 percent of the household growth expected in the District of Columbia over the next 20 years. 1506.1 The number of jobs is expected to increase from about 32,500 in 2005 to 57,900 in 2025. Much of the increase is anticipated to occur in the vicinity of M Street SE and along South Capitol Street. Job growth in this Planning Area represents more than one-fifth of the citywide 20-year total. 1506.2 AREA ELEM ENTS COMPREHENSIVE PLAN DISTRICT ELEMENTS ADOPTED 12/19/06 P. 2-105 Planning and Development Priorities 1507 Planning issues along the Anacostia Waterfront were discussed at many of the Comprehensive Plan workshops held in 2005 and 2006, particularly at meetings conducted on Capitol Hill and in Southwest DC. Priorities for this area were more explicitly stated during the three-year process that led to the development of the Anacostia Waterfront Framework Plan. Concurrent planning programs for the Southwest Waterfront, Reservation 13, and the Near Southeast in the early 2000s involved hundreds of District residents. Since 2000, several citizens advisory groups, focus groups, and design charettes have been convened, providing additional opportunities to identify key issues and goals. 1507.1 The Comprehensive Plan responds to the key messages provided by the community at these meetings. These are summarized below: 1507.2 (a) The river has come to symbolize the widening social and economic divide in the city, separating “east” from “west” and presenting a challenge to the city’s goal of growing more inclusively. It should instead become a unifier and a source of economic opportunity for the neighborhoods on its shores. The waterfront should unite the city physically, economically, and socially. This will require redefining its image and identity, and fundamentally redirecting growth patterns in the city toward emerging waterfront areas. [PULLQUOTE: The river has come to symbolize the widening social and economic divide in the city, separating “east” from “west” and presenting a challenge to the city’s goal of growing more inclusively. It should instead become a unifier and a source of economic opportunity for the neighborhoods on its shores.] (b) Revitalizing the waterfront must not be done at the expense of the established communities that exist near its shoreline. Existing neighborhoods and important community institutions should be conserved, and should be the focus of reinvestment during the coming years. Residents must have a say in the future of the waterfront and should be protected from displacement as change occurs. Within new neighborhoods, diverse housing choices should be provided so that a mix of household types and incomes are accommodated. Affordable housing for working families and for the city’s poorest residents must be part of this equation. Social and economic diversity must be respected c) The river provides a unique setting for monuments, memorials, and signature features that can potentially shape and redefine Washington’s identity in the 21st Century. This potential should not be squandered. The Potomac River is already a celebrated waterfront, but its character is distinctive in its own way. The Anacostia should be unique, with activities that invigorate urban life. New destinations should celebrate the cultural heritage of the city and the nation. As cultural facilities are developed, the extraordinary and unheralded stories of the neighborhoods along the river should be told d) Many of the great open spaces and parks of the Anacostia Waterfront are hard to find, underutilized, and neglected. These areas should be better connected to one another, and to the neighborhoods they 442 adjoin. A variety of park environments should be created, from lively urban waterfront plazas to serene natural settings. Trails and promenades are needed to provide better access along the shoreline, and to make the waterfront more accessible to surrounding communities. New parks, recreational areas, and cultural facilities should be developed. [Photo Caption: Canoeing on the Anacostia] AREA ELEM ENTS COMPREHENSIVE PLAN DISTRICT ELEMENTS ADOPTED 12/19/06 P. 2-106 (e) Urban development and natural resource conservation should not be mutually exclusive but should go hand in hand. Development on the waterfront—and throughout the watershed—should be environmentally sustainable and designed to minimize negative effects on water quality and ecological resources. In some cases, Plans to reduce sewage overflows into the river should be accompanied by restoration of wetlands and buried streams, and conservation of natural habitat. From a regional perspective, additional density along the waterfront is one of the best examples of “smart growth.” It can curb urban sprawl by channeling more housing demand back toward the center city. More density near the waterfront can also be used to leverage the creation of additional waterfront parks and open spaces f) Access between the east and west sides of the river should be improved. “Human” scale crossings should be emphasized, rather than the existing freeway bridges which are almost exclusively oriented toward cars and trucks. The design of transportation infrastructure should be rethought to better serve waterfront neighborhoods, reduce barriers to waterfront access, and create gateways to waterfront parks. Bridges should be regarded as opportunities for great civic architecture. In general, transportation design should strive for a better balance between the needs of cars, and the needs of pedestrians, bicyclists, and transit users. The river itself should be seen as a transit opportunity, with water taxis and ferries providing easy access across the river and to riverfront designations like Georgetown and Alexandria g) Development along the waterfront must be designed to respect the scale and integrity of adjacent neighborhoods. As the city works to create distinct waterfront destinations, it should also restore and rehabilitate historic structures, protect views and sunlight, reinforce existing neighborhood commercial centers, and enhance the quality of life for existing residents. While densities in new waterfront communities are likely to be higher than those in adjacent communities, they should not be visually overwhelming. This is particularly true where new development sites abut fine-grained row house neighborhoods that have existed for more than a century. Planning for large-scale development must be responsive to local concerns about traffic, crowd-control, displacement, community service impacts, and changing neighborhood character. [PULLQUOTE: Development along the waterfront must be designed to respect the scale and integrity of adjacent neighborhoods.

These policies and actions should be considered in tandem with those in the citywide elements of the Comprehensive Plan. 1508.1 Policy AW-1.1.1: Conservation of Established Waterfront Neighborhoods Revitalize and preserve established neighborhoods in the Waterfront Planning Area. Continued investment in the existing housing stock and in established local commercial areas should be strongly encouraged. 1508.2 AREA ELEM ENTS COMPREHENSIVE PLAN DISTRICT ELEMENTS ADOPTED 12/19/06 P. 2-107 Policy AW-1.1.2: New Waterfront Neighborhoods Create new mixed use neighborhoods on vacant or underutilized waterfront lands, particularly on large contiguous publicly-owned waterfront sites. Within the Lower Anacostia Waterfront/ Near 443 Southwest Planning Area, new neighborhoods should be developed at the Southwest Waterfront, Buzzard Point, Poplar Point, Southeast Federal Center and Carrollsburg areas. These neighborhoods should be linked to new neighborhoods upriver at Reservation 13, Poplar Point, and Kenilworth-Parkside. A substantial amount of new housing and commercial space should be developed in these areas, reaching households of all incomes, types, sizes, and needs. 1508.3 [Photo Caption: Southwest Waterfront] Policy AW-1.1.3: Waterfront Area Commercial Development Encourage commercial development in the Waterfront Area in a manner that is consistent with the Future Land Use Map. Such development should bring more retail services and choices to the Anacostia Waterfront as well as space for government and private sector activities, such as offices and hotels. Commercial development should be focused along key corridors, particularly along Maine Avenue and M Street Southeast, along South Capitol Street; and near the Waterfront/SEU and Navy Yardmetrorail stations. Maritime activities such as cruise ship operations should be maintained and supported as the waterfront redevelops.1508.5 Policy AW-1.1.4: Waterfront Development Amenities Leverage new development in the Waterfront Planning area to create amenities and benefits that serve existing and new residents. These amenities should include parks, job training and educational opportunities, new community services, and transportation and infrastructure improvements. 1508.6 Policy AW-1.1.5: River Basins as a Planning Guide Recognize and be responsive to the distinct settings and environments created by varying conditions along the shoreline. Consistent with the Anacostia Framework Plan, the river should be viewed as a series of “basins,” each defined by their unique physical and visual characteristics. In general, there should be a progression from a more urban environment on the lower basins (Washington Channel and the river gateway) to a more natural environment on the upper basins (Kingman and Heritage Islands, Arboretum, etc 1508.7 Policy AW-1.1.6: Pedestrian Orientation of Waterfront Uses Provide a high level of pedestrian amenities along the shoreline, including informational and interpretive signs, benches and street furniture, and public art. 1508.8 Policy AW-1.1.7: Multi-modal Waterfront Streets Design streets along the waterfront to be truly multi-modal, meeting the needs of pedestrians, bicyclists, and transit users as well as motor vehicles. Safe pedestrian crossings, including overpasses and underpasses, should be provided to improve waterfront access. 1508.9 Policy AW-1.1.8: Barriers to Shoreline Access Minimize the visual and accessibility impacts of railroad and highway infrastructure, surface parking, and industrial uses along the Anacostia River shoreline. In particular, the impacts of freeways on waterfront access should be mitigated by supporting the redesign of these facilities as tunnels or landscaped boulevards. 1508.10 Policy AW-1.1.9: Strengthening the M Street and Maine Avenue Corridors Strengthen the connection between Central Washington and the Anacostia Waterfront by rebuilding Maine Avenue and M Street SE as graciously landscaped urban boulevards. These streets should be AREA ELEM ENTS COMPREHENSIVE PLAN DISTRICT ELEMENTS ADOPTED 12/19/06 P. 2-108 designed with generous pedestrian amenities, public transit improvements, landscaping, and ground floor uses that create a vibrant street environment. 1508.11 Policy AW-1.1.10: Upgrading the Bridges Upgrade the bridges across the Anacostia River to better manage transportation flows, facilitate 444 pedestrian and bicycle travel across the river, and provide attractive and distinctive civic landmarks 1508.12 {last sentence moved to 813.2(d)} Action AW-1.1-A: Anacostia Waterfront Framework Plan Implement the recommendations of the Anacostia Waterfront Framework Plan through interagency coordination, ongoing activities of the Anacostia Waterfront Corporation, and continued cooperative efforts with the federal government. 1508.13 Action AW-1.1-B: River Crossing Improvements Implement the recommendations of the Middle Anacostia River Transportation Crossings Study that seek to improve local and regional traffic mobility. 1508.14 See the Citywide Elements for additional policies and actions related to the waterfront, including Land Use Element Section LU-1.2 on large sites, Transportation Sections T-2.5 on improvements to the Anacostia River bridges and T-2.1 on water taxis and streetcars, Environmental Protection Element Section E-3 on sustainability, and Urban Design Element Section UD-1.3 on Washington’s identity as a waterfront city. AW-1.2 Conserving and Enhancing Community Resources 1509 Policy AW-1.2.1: Historic and Cultural Waterfront Assets Capitalize on the historic and cultural assets located near the Lower Waterfront, such as the Washington Navy Yard and Fort McNair. Public education about these assets should be expanded, the physical connections between them should be enhanced, and greater recognition of their value and importance should be achieved. 1509.1 [Photo Caption: Water and Sewer Authority Building adjacent to the Southeast Federal Center] Policy AW-1.2.2: Waterfront Cultural and Commemorative Sites Encourage the siting of new museums, memorials, civic gathering places, and cultural attractions on or near the Anacostia River as a way to catalyze revitalization and meet the demand for additional commemorative works without further crowding the National Mall and monumental core of the city. Such facilities should make the most of their waterfront locations and create an integrated system of gracious, beautiful, and vibrant places. 1509.2 Policy AW-1.2.3: Waterfront Sports and Recreation Destinations Develop new destinations for sports, recreation, and celebration on or near the Anacostia waterfront. Ensure that these destinations are served by adequate and efficient transportation systems and infrastructure. 1509.3 Policy AW-1.2.4: Anacostia RiverParks Create a connected network of waterfront parks from Hains Point to the Sousa Bridge, and continuing through adjacent upriver Planning Areas to the Maryland border. These parks should be easily accessible to surrounding neighborhoods and accommodate the need for more local and regional serving recreational activities in the city. New parks should be an integral part of any new waterfront neighborhood, and AREA ELEM ENTS COMPREHENSIVE PLAN DISTRICT ELEMENTS ADOPTED 12/19/06 P. 2-109 should showcase the remarkably diverse landscape along the Anacostia River. A variety of active and passive recreational settings should be provided. 1509.7 Policy AW-1.2.5: African-American Heritage Recognize and highlight the role of Lower Waterfront neighborhoods in the history of the District’s African-American community. This role should be commemorated and recognized through markers, heritage trails, and cultural facilities. 1509.9 See the Citywide Elements for additional policies and actions on the waterfront, including Parks, Recreation, and Open Space Section PROS-3.2 on waterfront parks (including the Anacostia RiverParks Network) and PROS-3.3 on trails (including the Anacostia Riverwalk Environmental Protection Element Section E-1.2 on wetlands and E-4.2 on water pollution and water quality improvements, Urban 445 Design Element Section UD-1.3 policies on waterfront access, and Infrastructure Element Sections IN-2.2 and IN-2.3 on stormwater runoff and the combined sewer overflow project.

The area includes the Washington Fish Market, portions of East Potomac Park, a boating/residential community at Gangplank Marina, restaurants and entertainment uses, and parking areas. Nearby uses include the Arena Stage, several churches, Waterside Mall, office buildings, and apartments. Major points of access include 6th, 7th, and 9th Streets SW, M Street SW, and the Waterfront/ SEU Metro Station. 1511.1 Although it is relatively accessible and familiar to residents of Southwest, the Southwest Waterfront is not the active, public, civic space it could be. Roads and parking lots account for over 40 percent of the area, and there are 12 lanes of traffic (including both Water Street and Maine Avenue) between the shoreline and adjacent residential areas. L’Enfant Plaza and the National Mall are just a few blocks away. However, there is no clear means of pedestrian access from these heavily visited areas to the shoreline. With much of the Southwest Waterfront in public ownership, the city has a unique opportunity to 446 create a place that serves both as an extension of the adjacent neighborhood and a new regional destination. 1511.2 [PULLQUOTE: Although it is relatively accessible and familiar to residents of Southwest, the Southwest Waterfront is not the active, public, civic space it could be. Roads and parking lots account for over 40 percent of the area, and there are 12 lanes of traffic between the shoreline and adjacent residential areas.] The District completed the Southwest Waterfront Development Plan in 2003, adopting short-term and mid-term actions to transform the area. The Plan calls for eliminating Water Street and improving Maine Avenue as a pedestrian-friendly urban street. The elimination of Water Street and replacement of surface parking with structured parking will increase available public space and developable land. This will allow for the creation of new parks, plazas and mixed-use development. Active ground floor uses such as retail stores and restaurants will make this area an active and animated urban waterfront. 1511.3 Illustrative sketches in the Southwest Waterfront Plan envision some 800 new residences, a large hotel, and more than 500,000 square feet of retail, office, cultural, and civic uses. New public gathering places will include an urban “Market Square” near the Fish Wharf, and a more passive Civic Park at the south end of the waterfront near M Street SW. Between these spaces will be a series of smaller plazas on the Washington Channel that mark the ends of local streets. The existing fish market will be retained in its present location and refurbished, with its low scale character maintained. Development of the park at the south end of the waterfront is contingent on a number of factors, including relocation of the tour boat terminals and surface parking to a new location further north on the Channel. Until this can be accomplished, the existing terminals will be supported in their current location. Even though the Future Land Use Map designates the location of the tour boat terminals and their surface parking as Mixed Use AREA ELEM ENTS COMPREHENSIVE PLAN DISTRICT ELEMENTS ADOPTED 12/19/06 P. 2-111 Low Density Commercial and Parks, Recreation, and Open Space, the existing low density commercial use and zoning would not be inconsistent with this map designation. 1511.4 The illustrative plans also suggest improving pedestrian access to the waterfront via the Banneker Overlook at the foot of 10th Street SW and the development of a museum or monument in this area. New water taxi service, transit improvements, and landscaping also are called for. 1511.5 Plans for the Southwest Waterfront should be implemented in a way that recognizes the broader context of the Southwest neighborhood. Southwest is a strong urban community which benefits from the wide social, economic, and ethnic diversity of its residents, as well as a diverse mix of housing types and affordability levels. The neighborhood includes Waterside Mall, initially envisioned as Southwest’s “Town Square” in the 1950s-era urban renewal plans. Today the Mall is an office and retail complex of over one million square feet of floor space, including a supermarket, drug store, and bank. Waterside Mall never evolved into the Town Square it was envisioned to become, and today is planned for redevelopment. Plans for the site call for the re-establishment of 4th Street through the site, and the retention and improvement of retail and office space—along with new uses such as housing and open 447 space. 1511.6 Policy AW-2.1.1: Mixed Use Development Support the redevelopment of the Southwest Waterfront with medium to high-density housing, commercial and cultural uses, and improved open space and parking. The development should be designed to make the most of the waterfront location, preserving views and enhancing access to and along the shoreline. 1511.7 Policy AW-2.1.2: New Public Spaces and Open Space Create new public spaces and plazas at the Southwest waterfront, including an expanded public promenade at the water’s edge. Public piers should extend from each of the major terminating streets, providing views and public access to the water. 1511.8 Policy AW-2.1.3: Connecting to the Southwest Waterfront Enhance pedestrian connections from the Southwest neighborhood and L’Enfant Plaza area to the Washington Channel by creating new public spaces and trails, eliminating Water Street, reducing surface parking, linking the Banneker Overlook to Maine Avenue, and providing safer pedestrian crossings across Maine Avenue. 1511.9 Policy AW-2.1.4: Maine Avenue Transform Maine Avenue into a landscaped urban street that has direct access to waterfront uses, provides a pedestrian-friendly street environment, and accommodates multiple modes of travel (including bicycles 1511.10 Policy AW-2.1.5: Washington Channel Maritime Activities Reorganize the Washington Channel’s maritime activities, including cruise ship berths and marinas, to provide more appropriate relationships to landside uses and provide opportunities for water taxis, ferries, and other forms of water transportation. In implementing this policy, cruise ship operations should be retained and supported, recognizing their economic benefits to the city and their recreational and cultural value for residents and tourists. 1511.11 Policy AW-2.1.6: Waterside Mall Support the redevelopment of Waterside Mall with residential, office, and local-serving retail uses. The site should be strengthened as a retail anchor for the surrounding Southwest community. Its redesign AREA ELEM ENTS COMPREHENSIVE PLAN DISTRICT ELEMENTS ADOPTED 12/19/06 P. 2-112 should restore 4th Street SW as part of the city street grid, and improve aesthetics, circulation, and connectivity to surrounding uses. 1511.12 Action AW-2.1-A: Southwest Waterfront Development Plan Implement the 2003 Southwest Waterfront Development Plan. 1511.13 Action AW-2.1-B: Long-Term Improvements Study the feasibility of the long-term improvements identified in the Southwest Waterfront Plan, such as a Hains Point Canal (in East Potomac Park relocation of cruise lines and their infrastructure, a new Yellow Line Metro station at the waterfront, and construction of a pedestrian bridge across the Channel near the Case Bridge. 1511.14 [Photo Caption: Renderings of possible Southwest Waterfront development and Waterfront promenade (illustrative only)] AW-2.2: South Capitol Street/ Buzzard Point 1512 South Capitol Street is one of the District’s four principal axes and marks the division between the southeast and southwest quadrants of the city. It is an important part of the regional highway system, with traffic volumes of approximately 100,000 cars per day. The street provides many residents and visitors with their first view of the U.S. Capitol building and is an important gateway into Central Washington. 1512.1 448 This symbolic role contrasts with the current state of the corridor. Awkwardly shaped properties, some vacant and other barricaded from public access, front the street between the U.S. Capitol and I-395. Elevated railroad tracks and freeway ramps obstruct vistas and the massive Capitol Power Plant is a looming presence. South of I-395, the street enters into a jumble of fast food restaurants, gas stations, poorly maintained commercial uses, vacant businesses, and parking lots. South of the Frederick Douglass Bridge, these uses give way to an eclectic mix of industrial and utility uses along the shoreline, including a power plant. 1512.2 The transportation infrastructure in the area also creates a significant barrier. Both South Capitol Street and the Frederick Douglass Bridge are in need of repair. There are no bike lanes along South Capitol Street and sidewalks are minimal and unshaded. High speed traffic and the lack of signalized intersections have been a deterrent to investment and create a harsh environment for pedestrians. 1512.3 For the last ten years, the District has been working with its federal partners to transform South Capitol Street into a grand urban boulevard with a mix of land uses and commemorative works that are more fitting of its role as a gateway to the national capital. Such a vision was first laid out in the 1997 National Capital Planning Commission Legacy Plan, and later refined by the 2003 South Capitol Urban Design Study. A Task Force including federal and District representatives was convened in 2004 to develop design options and an open space framework for the corridor. Concurrently, the District selected a 20- acre site on the east side of South Capitol Street between Potomac Avenue and N Street SE as the site for a new 41,000-seat baseball stadium. 1512.4 Over the coming decades, South Capitol Street will be transformed into a waterfront gateway with new mixed use development, green space, broad sidewalks, and a beautiful new and realigned Frederick Douglass Memorial Bridge. High-density office, housing, and retail uses are envisioned along the corridor between I-395 and the shoreline. The stadium will become the centerpiece of a new entertainment district that will include cultural attractions, retail, restaurants, and high-density housing. Near the foot of the reconstructed Frederick Douglass bridge, an oval traffic rotary is planned to create a AREA ELEM ENTS COMPREHENSIVE PLAN DISTRICT ELEMENTS ADOPTED 12/19/06 P. 2-113 green “commons” for a future national memorial. A new waterfront park will be created at the shoreline, linked to the network of parks planned up and down the river. Further south in Buzzard Point, new mixed use residential and commercial development will be encouraged on former industrial land. 1512.5 [PULLQUOTE: Over the coming decades, South Capitol Street will be transformed into a waterfront gateway with new mixed use development, green space, broad sidewalks, and a beautiful new and realigned Frederick Douglass Memorial Bridge.] The South Capitol corridor will require additional planning and analysis in the coming years. Detailed area planning for the Baseball Stadium vicinity is already underway. Future plans will need to focus on the Buzzard Point waterfront, addressing such issues as land use compatibility, the relocation (or retention) of existing uses, transportation and access, and urban design. Plans for this area should improve connections between Southwest and the waterfront, and should retain and improve the established low-scale residential areas on the west side of South Capitol Street. 1512.6 Policy AW-2.2.1: South Capitol Street Urban Boulevard Transform South Capitol Street into a great urban boulevard and “walking” street, befitting its role as 449 a gateway to the U.S. Capitol and a major Anacostia River crossing. Development along the street should include a mix of federal, District, and private uses. 1512.7 [Photo Caption: South Capitol Street] Policy AW-2.2.2: Ballpark Entertainment District Leverage the construction of the Washington Nationals Ballpark to catalyze development of the South Capitol Street corridor with retail, high density residential, entertainment, and commercial uses. 1512.8 Policy AW-2.2.3: South Capitol Commemorative and Civic Uses Incorporate ceremonial uses such as memorials, plazas, monuments, museums and other commemorative works, along the South Capitol Street Corridor. The revitalized street provides a significant opportunity to expand civic and cultural facilities beyond the confines of the monumental core. 1512.9 Policy AW-2.2.4: South Capitol Street Transit Improvements Promote transit improvements along the South Capitol Corridor, including streetcar or bus rapid transit, and improved pedestrian connections to the Metrorail stations at Navy Yard and Waterside Mall /SEU. 1512.10 Policy AW-2.2.5: South Capitol Open Space Create additional open space in the South Capitol Street corridor, including an oval traffic rotary and South Capitol “commons,” and a new waterfront park along the Anacostia shoreline. 1512.11 Policy AW-2.2.6: South Capitol Neighborhood Buffers Ensure that the established communities adjacent to the South Capitol Street corridor, including the James Creek and Greenleaf Gardens housing projects and adjacent residential areas, are buffered from adverse impacts associated with increased density and traffic relating to stadium area development. Conserve these communities as important parts of the city fabric, and as affordable housing resources for the Southwest community. 1512.12 AREA ELEM ENTS COMPREHENSIVE PLAN DISTRICT ELEMENTS ADOPTED 12/19/06 P. 2-114 Policy AW-2.2.7: Buzzard Point Support the long-term redevelopment of Buzzard Point with mixed medium- to high-density commercial and residential uses. Recognize the opportunity for innovative design and architecture in this area, and for the creation of a unique urban waterfront. 1512.13 Action AW-2.2-A: Coordination with Federal Agencies Continue to coordinate with the National Capital Planning Commission, the National Park Service, and other federal agencies on implementing and refining the South Capitol Street Urban Design Study. 1512.14 Action AW-2.2-B: Ballpark Area Plan Work collaboratively with the Anacostia Waterfront Corporation in completing detailed area plans for the Ballpark entertainment district. 1512.15 Action AW-2.2.-C: Buzzard Point Plan Work collaboratively with the Anacostia Waterfront Corporation in developing a detailed area plan for Buzzard Point. The Plan should address the future of industrial and utility uses in Buzzard Point, identify concepts and standards for new development, and address a range of related urban design, transportation, infrastructure, environmental, and community service issues. The feasibility of access along the Fort 450 McNair waterfront also should be addressed. 1512.16 Action AW-2.2-D: South Capitol Gateway Create a civic or commemorative feature of national significance at the north end of the Frederick Douglass Bridge to celebrate this location as a riverfront and city gateway. 1512.17 Action AW-2.2-E: South Capitol Transportation Improvements Continue efforts to improve traffic flows and accommodate additional travel modes along South Capitol Street, including completion of the South Capitol Environmental Impact Statement and the reconstruction of the Frederick Douglass Memorial Bridge and related access points. 1512.18 AW-2.3 Near Southeast 1513 The Near Southeast includes the triangular area between the Southeast/Southwest Freeway, South Capitol Street, and the Anacostia River. This 350-acre area has played an important role in the history of Washington, D.C.—its initial settlement even predates the creation of the District of Columbia. In the 19th century, this was a community where residential streets came down to the river’s edge, a place teeming with life and maritime activity. Near Southeast suffered substantial disinvestment during the second half of the 20th century, however, along with social and economic decline. The 2000 Census reported that the area had one of the highest poverty and unemployment rates in the city. Much of the land near the shoreline still sits vacant today and is fenced off from public access. 1513.1 Over the last ten years, District and federal initiatives have begun to transform the Near Southeast into a dynamic waterfront neighborhood and workplace. These initiatives have included the relocation of 5,000 federal employees back to the Washington Navy Yard, the redevelopment of the Arthur Capper Carrollsburg public housing project through the federal HOPE VI program, construction of a new headquarters for the US Department of Transportation, and the reconfiguration of the 55-acre Southeast Federal Center to allow new housing, offices, and waterfront parkland. Significant private and public investment has followed, including the construction of new office buildings, hotels, housing, and most recently, groundbreaking for the new Washington Nationals ballpark (see discussion under Section AW- 2.2 1513.2 AREA ELEM ENTS COMPREHENSIVE PLAN DISTRICT ELEMENTS ADOPTED 12/19/06 P. 2-115 [PULLQUOTE: Over the last ten years, District and federal initiatives have begun to transform the Near Southeast into a dynamic waterfront neighborhood and workplace.] Revitalization of the Near Southeast has been one of the cornerstones of the Anacostia Waterfront Initiative. A 2003 AWI Urban Design Plan for the area provides a framework for its redevelopment. The Plan seeks to harness the development momentum in the Near Southeast and provide the direction necessary to help the neighborhood reach its full potential. It also addresses the infrastructure, transportation, open space, and streetscape improvements necessary to support redevelopment. The Near Southeast Plan establishes strategies to reconnect the area to the river, create mixed income housing opportunities, provide pedestrian-friendly streets, and establish great public spaces both on the waterfront and in the adjacent neighborhood. One of its most important principles is to preserve existing low income housing in the area, while adding thousands of units of new market rate and workforce housing. 1513.3 The Near Southeast Plan envisions M Street SE as a great urban boulevard with high-density offices and apartments activated by ground floor retail space, restaurants, and civic uses. It calls for the extension of New Jersey Avenue and other streets in the city grid to the waterfront, terminating at a new shoreline 451 park and waterfront promenade. The Plan calls for the preservation of important historic resources such as the “Blue Castle” trolley barn and Latrobe Gate at the Navy Yard, as well as the historic street grid and network of park reservations laid out by Pierre L’Enfant. Strategies to link the area with adjacent neighborhoods like Southwest and Capitol Hill also are provided. 1513.4 Several subareas are identified by the Near Southeast Plan, with land use and urban design goals are set forth for each. These areas are South Capitol Gateway, Canal Blocks, Capper Carrollsburg, the Marine Barracks area, the 8th Street SE historic area, East M Street, the Navy Yard, the Southeast Federal Center, and the WASA pump station area. Strategies to better connect and integrate these areas are provided. The Near Southeast Plan lays out a street and block plan for the entire area, as well a trail system and open space framework. Guidelines for specific sites such as Florida Rock (near the foot of South Capitol) and Maritime Plaza (the former Washington Gas site) are provided to ensure that planned development fits into the framework for the overall area. 1513.5 The Near Southeast Urban Design Plan envisions a net increase of 4,200 housing units, 13.6 million square feet of office space, and 705,000 square feet of retail area within the area’s boundaries. The Plan also identifies more than 40 acres of new parks and open space. Collaborative planning between the District, the federal government, and the private sector has been ongoing since the Near Southeast Plan was completed and will continue during the years ahead. 1513.6 [PULLQUOTE: The Near Southeast Urban Design Plan envisions a net increase of 4,200 housing units, 13.6 million square feet of office space, and 705,000 square feet of retail area within the area’s boundaries.

Encourage high-density mixed use development and open space on newly configured parcels, with new buildings designed and oriented to make the most of their waterfront or near-waterfront settings. 1513.7 Policy AW-2.3.2: Near Southeast Shoreline Access Improve shoreline access and movement to and through the Near Southeast by eliminating real and perceived barriers, improving public space and street corridors, reducing the amount of land occupied by surface parking and industrial uses, and encouraging new land uses that maximize public activity near the waterfront. 1513.8 AREA ELEM ENTS COMPREHENSIVE PLAN DISTRICT ELEMENTS ADOPTED 12/19/06 P. 2-116 Policy AW-2.3.3: Near Southeast Housing Opportunities Significantly increase residential land uses in the Near Southeast, particularly in the Southeast Federal Center, Capper Carrollsburg, Canal Blocks, and South Capitol Gateway areas. Consistent with the existing zoning for these areas, mixed use development that includes housing as well as commercial uses should be strongly encouraged. The mix of housing should accommodate residents of all incomes and household types. 1513.9 Policy AW-2.3.4: M Street Southeast Transform M Street into an attractive pedestrian-oriented thoroughfare, lined with retail shops and services, with upper story office, hotels, and residential uses. The street itself should be designed as a 452 multi-modal boulevard, accommodating pedestrians, bicycles, and transit vehicles as well as cars. It should strengthen connections between the Near Southeast, Southwest, and Capitol Hill. 1513.10 Policy AW-2.3.5: Restoration of the L’Enfant Plan in Near Southeast Restore key elements of the original L’Enfant street plan within Near Southeast, including the city street grid, the extension of New Jersey Avenue and 3rd and 4th Streets SE to the waterfront, and the possible replacement of the Southeast/Southwest Freeway with an at-grade boulevard (Virginia Avenue 1513.11 Policy AW-2.3.6: Near Southeast Urban Amenities Leverage new development in the Near Southeast to create amenities such as parks, trails, child care facilities, civic uses, and retail space that serve the area’s residents and workforce. 1513.12 Policy AW-2.3.7: Near Southeast Historic Identity Create an identity in the Near Southeast that celebrates the area’s history and integrates important historic and cultural resources. These resources include the Navy Yard, local educational, religious, and cultural institutions, and historic landmarks, including industrial and utility buildings like the DC Pumping Station. 1513.13 [Photo Caption: Near Southeast, WASA building in foreground and US Capitol in background] Action AW-2.3-A: Near Southeast Urban Design Plan Implementation Implement the recommendations of the Near Southeast Urban Design Framework Plan, including zoning, financing, phasing, and infrastructure improvements. 1513.14 Action AW-2.3-B: Canal Blocks and Waterfront Park Create the Canal Blocks Park on the three blocks between M Street and I Street that once contained the historic Washington Canal. Create a waterfront park of at least five acres along the shoreline at the Southeast Federal Center. These two parks should be designed as attractions and amenities for Near Southeast residents, employees, and visitors. They should be linked to each other and to Garfield Park and the Virginia Avenue playground by trails and greenways, and connected to other waterfront open spaces by the proposed Anacostia Riverwalk and Trail system. 1513.15 [Photo Caption: Aerial view of the site of the proposed Canal Blocks Park] Action AW-2.3-C: Zoning Incentives Continue to develop and apply zoning incentives to promote residential uses within the near Southeast, such as the Capitol Gateway Overlay District. Zoning changes should not diminish established provisions for transfer of development rights into the Capitol South area. 1513.16 AREA ELEM ENTS COMPREHENSIVE PLAN DISTRICT ELEMENTS ADOPTED 12/19/06 P. 2-117 Action AW-2.3-D: Cushing Place Consider Cushing Place to be an “alley” rather than a “street” for the purpose of regulating future driveway locations, thereby ensuring that future development may be designed to minimize disruption of the street environment with curb cuts, and to maximize access to sunlight. See also the Capitol Hill Area Element for policies on the connection between this area and Barracks Row and the importance of retaining the historic scale of 8th Street SE. AW-2.4 Poplar Point 1514 Poplar Point encompasses the area on the east side of the Anacostia River bounded by South Capitol Street, I-295, and the 11th Street Bridge. The area contains U.S. Park Police and National Park Service facilities, the former Architect of the Capitol nurseries, a 700-space Metrorail parking garage, private land along Howard Road, a WASA pump station, and more than 60 acres of managed meadows. The point was created through the filling of tidal mudflats in the 1910s, and has been used for tree nurseries 453 and federal and District maintenance activities for almost a century. Construction of freeways in the 1950s and 1960s left Poplar Point disconnected from the neighborhoods around it. 1514.1 Poplar Point remains isolated today and is underutilized as a great waterfront open space. It is completely unknown to visitors and even most residents of the District of Columbia. Nearly half the site is fenced off from public access and much of the remainder is covered by freeway ramps and bridge approaches. Over the last ten years, a variety of alternatives for the site’s future have been explored. Among others, these have included a regional big box shopping center, a Frederick Douglass National Memorial Park, an expanded WMATA parking lot, and a National African American Museum and Cultural Complex. 1514.2 In 2003, the Anacostia Waterfront Initiative called for the site’s improvement as a green gateway to the Anacostia River Park network. Today, Poplar Point is envisioned as the future crown jewel in a necklace of great parks extending from Kenilworth Aquatic Gardens on the north to the mouth of the Anacostia River on the south. Key features of this park will include restored wetlands, a daylighted Stickfoot Creek, and new cultural and entertainment facilities. Poplar Point has also been identified by the National Capital Planning Commission as a potential site for new monuments, commemorative works and museums. It has also been discussed as a possible site for a 27,000-seat soccer stadium. 1514.3 [PULLQUOTE: Poplar Point is envisioned as the future crown jewel in a necklace of great parks extending from Kenilworth Aquatic Gardens on the north to the mouth of the Anacostia River on the south. Key features of this park will include restored wetlands, a daylighted Stickfoot Creek, and new cultural and entertainment facilities.] The Poplar Point Target Area Plan recommends rebuilding Anacostia Drive along a crescent-shaped alignment that divides the 120-acre area into roughly two halves. The park will be developed to the north of the crescent and a new mixed use neighborhood will be developed to the south. Medium to highdensity housing should be provided within this neighborhood, with new development used to leverage the recreational and environmental improvements that will make this a great future public place for all Washingtonians. 1514.4 The new Poplar Point park and neighborhood will be well connected to the nearby Anacostia Metrorail station and to new modes of transit including water taxis, shuttles, and circulators. Connections to the historic neighborhoods east of I-295 will be strengthened by upgrading Howard Road, W Street SE, and Good Hope Road and improving pedestrian and bicycle access along these gateways. Redevelopment of Poplar Point is intended to coincide with and bolster parallel initiatives to revitalize Historic Anacostia, redevelop St. Elizabeths Hospital, and rebuild Barry Farms. 1514.5 AREA ELEM ENTS COMPREHENSIVE PLAN DISTRICT ELEMENTS ADOPTED 12/19/06 P. 2-118 Notable skyline features such as the Washington Monument and U.S. Capitol are visible from much of Poplar Point. The site also affords views of the tree-lined ridge above Historic Anacostia. Future structures on the site should preserve these important views, and make the most of the Point’s spectacular physical setting. Development should maintain a scale that is compatible with and contributes to the fabric of adjacent neighborhoods, breaking development into identifiable, distinctive parts rather than creating “superblocks.” 1514.6 454 Policy AW-2.4.1: Poplar Point Park Create a great urban park at Poplar Point that serves neighborhoods across the city, and that includes a variety of active and passive recreation areas. The park should be designed to serve a variety of users, including children, youth, families, and seniors. 1514.7 Policy AW-2.4.2: Environmental Restoration at Poplar Point Restore the natural environment at Poplar Point, especially the wetlands and Stickfoot Creek. The creek should be daylighted and restored as a natural habitat area. 1514.8 Policy AW-2.4.3: Poplar Point Mixed Use Neighborhood Create a new transit-oriented mixed use neighborhood oriented around the Poplar Point Park, and linked to the Anacostia Metrorail station and new Anacostia streetcar line. The neighborhood should include a significant component of affordable housing, and should also include retail and civic uses that benefit the adjacent communities east of I-295. To minimize the loss of useable open space, development should utilize the land recovered after the realignment and reconstruction of the Frederick Douglass Bridge. 1514.9 Policy AW-2.4.4: Poplar Point Cultural Facilities Support the development of regional cultural facilities at Poplar Point, such as museums, memorial sites, gardens, nature centers, amphitheaters, and public gathering places. 1514.10 Policy AW-2.4.5: Scale of Development at Poplar Point Provide a scale and pattern of development in Poplar Point that is compatible with the fine-grained pattern found in nearby Historic Anacostia. Development should be pedestrian-oriented and should include active ground floor uses. The massing, height, and bulk of buildings and related features such as parking also should respect adjacent park uses and environmentally sensitive areas. 1514.11 Policy AW-2.4.6: Poplar Point Vista and View Preservation Ensure that the design of Poplar Point capitalizes on significant views to the river and U.S. Capitol. The New Jersey Avenue axis is particularly important, as it provides a clear line of sight to the Capitol dome from Poplar Point’s prominent river bend. 1514.12 Policy AW-2.4.7: Poplar Point as an Economic Catalyst Use development at Poplar Point to bring economic development opportunities to adjacent neighborhoods, particularly Barry Farms and Historic Anacostia. Activities at Poplar Point should foster the success of existing businesses in Historic Anacostia, provide job opportunities, and create cultural, educational, and institutional uses that benefit East of the River communities. 1514.13 Policy AW-2.4.8: Access Improvements to Poplar Point Improve access to Poplar Point by redesigning the road system on the site’s perimeter, rebuilding the Frederick Douglass (South Capitol) bridge, converting the Anacostia Metrorail station to a mulit- modal terminal, adding provisions for pedestrians and bicycles along Howard Road, W Street SE, and Good Hope Road, and providing water taxi service on the Anacostia River. 1514.14 AREA ELEM ENTS COMPREHENSIVE PLAN DISTRICT ELEMENTS ADOPTED 12/19/06 P. 2-119 [Photo Caption: Poplar Point] Action AW-2.4.A: Poplar Point Planning Conduct additional detailed planning studies for Poplar Point, refining the preliminary development program set forth by the 2003 Target Area Plan. The desired mix of land uses and building intensities for the site should be further defined, and the specific transportation and infrastructure improvements necessary to support development and park construction should be identified. 1514.15 455 Action AW-2.4.B: Poplar Point Long-Range Transportation Improvements As recommended by the 2003 Target Area Plan, assess the feasibility of long-term modifications to the regional highway system on the perimeter of Poplar Point. These include depressing I-295 to facilitate crossings from Historic Anacostia to the waterfront, improving the connection between Suitland Parkway and South Capitol Street, and building a tunnel between I-295 and I-395. 1514.16 See the Far Southeast and Southwest Area Element for additional language on the Anacostia Metrorail Station area. AREA ELEM ENTS COMPREHENSIVE PLAN DISTRICT ELEMENTS ADOPTED 12/19/06 P. 2-120 CHAPTER 20 MID-CITY AREA ELEMENT [ Note: the map facing page 20-1 has been edited to label the neighborhoods Pleasant Plains, Park View, and Eckington] Overview 2000 The Mid-City Planning Area encompasses the 3.1 square miles located in the geographic center of the District of Columbia. It extends from Rock Creek Park on the west to the CSX rail corridor on the east. Its southern edge is formed by Florida Avenue and U Street NW, and its northern edge is formed by Spring Road and Rock Creek Church Road. The boundaries are shown in the Map at left. Most of this area has historically been Council Ward 1 although the easternmost portion is currently part of Ward 5 and the southernmost portion is currently in Ward 2. 2000.1 Mid-City is one of the most diverse parts of the city. Although it is one of the smallest of the ten planning areas geographically, it is the most populous and most dense. Much of the area was developed during the late 19th and early 20th centuries, giving it a rich and historic urban character. The area includes row house neighborhoods such as Adams Morgan, Columbia Heights, Eckington, Le Droit Park, Park View, and Mount Pleasant. It includes large apartment communities along streets such as 14th Street, 16th Street, and Columbia Road. It is also home to several large institutions, such as Howard University and Howard University Hospital. 2000.2 The Mid-City Planning Area is a cultural melting pot, with a strong international flavor. It is the heart of the city’s Latino community, the home of some of Washington’s most important African American landmarks and cultural resources, and a gateway for immigrants from across the globe. It includes the vibrant nightlife and ethnic restaurants of 18th Street and the “New U” Street, and other walkable neighborhood centers that embody the best qualities of urban living. The area is well-served by the District’s transportation system, including the Metro Green Line, numerous bus lines, and several crosstown arterials. 2000.3 Many of the neighborhoods of Mid-City have a strong sense of identity. There are several historic districts, including Greater U Street, Mount Pleasant, Le Droit Park, and Striver’s Section—along with historic landmarks such as the True Reformer Building, Meridian Hill Park, the Lincoln and Howard Theaters, and the Prince Hall Masonic Temple. Activities like Adams Morgan Day and the Georgia Avenue Caribbean Festival celebrate local culture and build community pride. 2000.4 The area also has a tradition of neighborhood activism, embodied by groups such as the Kalorama Citizens Association and the Cardozo-Shaw Neighborhood Association. Non-profits like the Latino Economic Development Corporation and the Columbia Heights Development Corporation are also active 456 in community affairs, as are cultural organizations like the Gala Hispanic Theater and the African American Civil War Memorial Freedom Foundation. 2000.5 Parts of the Mid-City have changed rapidly during the last ten years. Some 2,000 housing units were added between 2000 and 2005, and about 1,500 units are in some stage of construction today. While this change has been welcomed by some, it has also created concerns about a loss of community identity and the displacement of residents. Homeowners have faced sharp increase in property taxes, and many renters have faced soaring rents and low vacancies. The median sales price of a home in the Columbia Heights zip code rose a staggering 63 percent between 2004 and 2005 alone. Clearly, these kinds of AREA ELEM ENTS COMPREHENSIVE PLAN DISTRICT ELEMENTS ADOPTED 12/19/06 P. 2-121 increases are not sustainable and over the long run will threaten the diversity that makes the Mid-City neighborhoods so unique. 2000.6 The area’s economic diversity is threatened not only by rising housing costs, but also by the loss of subsidized rental housing. Mid-City includes many subsidized and lower cost units, including projectbased Section 8 apartments that are at risk of conversion to market rents or condos. Over the last eight years, the District successfully conserved more than 1,000 units of at-risk affordable housing on the 14th Street corridor alone. The District has also assisted tenants in their efforts to renovate and purchase apartment properties throughout the community, particularly in Columbia Heights. Millions of dollars have been invested to create new affordable housing opportunities for current and future Mid-City residents. This investment must be sustained in the future. 2000.7 [Photo caption: Mid-City neighborhoods like Adams Morgan have a strong sense of identity.] Mid-City neighborhoods still struggle with urban problems such as violent crime, homelessness, drug abuse, vagrancy, and blight. Despite the real estate boom, buildings continue to lie vacant along commercial corridors such as lower Georgia Avenue, Florida Avenue, and North Capitol Street. Public facilities like Cardozo High School and Bruce Monroe Elementary are in desperate need of modernization. The area also has a severe shortage of parkland. As the densest part of the city, and one with many young children, recreational needs are among the highest in the city. Most of the area’s parks lack the land and amenities to meet these needs. 2000.8 A different set of urban tensions is present along the area’s rapidly developing corridors such as 14th Street and U Street. Revitalization has brought traffic and parking pressures, caused construction- related street disruptions, and has burdened small businesses trying to keep up with rising costs. There are also visible threats to the historic integrity of many of the area’s residential structures; particularly in areas like Adams Morgan, Columbia Heights, Bloomingdale, and Eckington, which are outside of designated historic districts. In some instances, row houses are being converted to multi-family flats; in others, demolitions and poorly designed alterations are diminishing an important part of Washington’s architectural heritage. 2000.9 As the Mid-City area moves into the 21st century, the issues described above must be addressed to protect the quality of life, balance growth and conservation, and provide economic opportunity and stability for all members of the community. 2000.10 Context History 2001 Urban development in the Mid-City area began in the early 19th century. Some of the city’s earliest mansions were constructed on the high ground above the L’Enfant city, including the Porter Mansion (later to become Meridian Hill Park) and the Holmead Estate (later subdivided as Mount Pleasant 457 The Columbian College, which would eventually become George Washington University, was founded on Meridian Hill in 1822. Howard University was established 45 years later, in 1867. Still, much of the area remained rural until the late 19th century. Stagecoaches ran up and down what is now 14th Street, connecting the area’s small hamlets, estates, and farms to the center city. 2001.1 The Mid-City’s development boom was tied to the growth of the city’s transportation system. Several streetcar lines were extended north from the city center in the 1880s, including lines along 7th Street and AREA ELEM ENTS COMPREHENSIVE PLAN DISTRICT ELEMENTS ADOPTED 12/19/06 P. 2-122 14th Street. Commercial uses developed along these routes, a pattern that persists to this day. By the turn of the century, streetcars had been extended along Florida Avenue, U Street, 11th Street, 18th Street, Calvert Street, 11th Street, and out to LeDroit Park and beyond. Residential development was extensive, and neighborhoods like Adams Morgan, Columbia Heights, Kalorama, Bloomingdale, and Eckington emerged as the city’s first generation suburbs. 2001.2 Many of the Mid-City neighborhoods were quite prestigious. Located above the Potomac escarpment, places like Mount Pleasant and Columbia Heights were felt to have healthier air and cooler summertime weather than the old city below. Elegant apartment buildings and embassies were developed along 16th Street, where commercial uses were not permitted in order to preserve the street’s character as the formal gateway to the White House. To the east, neighborhoods like LeDroit Park became home to a growing community of upwardly mobile African-Americans. Howard University emerged as one of the country’s leading African-American colleges and a seat of learning for Black scholars and professors. U Street thrived as the city’s “Black Broadway” and a cultural legacy of music, art, and theater was born. 2001.3 [PULLQUOTE: Howard University emerged as one of the country’s leading African-American colleges and a seat of learning for Black scholars and professors. U Street thrived as the city’s “Black Broadway” and a cultural legacy of music, art, and theater was born.] By 1930, the area’s initial development was essentially complete. Population continued to grow, and the area continued to develop with apartment buildings and denser housing. Residents were encouraged to take in boarders during the war years, and some of the larger row houses were converted into multi- family buildings and rooming houses. 2001.4 With the end of World War II in 1945 and desegregation of schools in 1954, conditions in the Mid- City neighborhoods began to change. Racial change accelerated in the 1950s and urban renewal created disruption in neighborhoods like Shaw and Eckington. Middle class Black and White households began to leave the area, leaving behind a growing population of lower income households. The area’s future was further jeopardized by the proposed Inner Loop Freeway in the 1950s. Had the Freeway been built, much of the Adams Morgan and U Street neighborhoods would have been destroyed. 2001.5 Mid-City was particularly hard hit by the 1968 riots. Many buildings along 14th and U Streets were burned and the psyche of the community was devastated. Reinvestment and recovery were slow. Urban renewal plans for Shaw and 14th Streets brought large numbers of subsidized apartments in the 458 1970s, but many of the commercial businesses never reopened. 2001.6 While parts of the area continued to decline during the 1980s and 90s; other areas began experiencing a renaissance. By the 1990s, Adams Morgan had gained a reputation as one of the city’s most colorful neighborhoods and many of its homes were restored and upgraded. Loft and condominium construction and residential rehabilitation continues in the neighborhood today. 2001.7 During the 1980s and 90s, an influx of residents from Latin America began to transform communities like Columbia Heights and Mount Pleasant. The transformation continued during the early 2000s following the opening of the Columbia Heights Metro Station. A 500,000 square foot commercial center—the largest retail construction project in the city—will soon rise beside the station. Projects like Harrison Square, the Lincoln Condominiums, and Ellington Plaza have brought hundreds of new residents to U Street. Elsewhere in the Mid-City, vacant homes are being rehabbed throughout Shaw, LeDroit Park, Eckington, Bloomingdale, Park View, and Pleasant Plains. 2001.8 AREA ELEM ENTS COMPREHENSIVE PLAN DISTRICT ELEMENTS ADOPTED 12/19/06 P. 2-123 Land Use 2002 Land use statistics for this Planning Area appear in Figure 20.1. Mid-City comprises about 1,970 acres, or about five percent of the city’s land area. 2002.1 [INSERT Figure 20.1: Land Use Composition: Mid-City 2002.3] [Pie chart “slices” are unchanged since July Draft] The area is primarily residential, with row houses being the predominant house type. Only about two percent of the residential area contains single family detached housing, whereas more than 70 percent contains row houses. The remainder of the residential land, totaling almost 200 acres, consists of apartments. Parts of the Mid-City Planning Area contain row houses, flats, and high-rise apartments on the same block. This pattern has been perpetuated in part by high-density zoning, a vestige of a time when the older housing in the area was thought to be obsolete and in need of replacement. 2002.2 The commercial areas of Mid-City tend to be laid out along neighborhood shopping streets and are frequently intermixed with housing. Major commercial areas include 18th Street, Columbia Road, 14th Street, Mount Pleasant Street, U Street, 7th Street/ Georgia Avenue, and North Capitol Street. There is little space for parking or loading in these business districts, and residential neighborhoods often lie immediately adjacent. Commercial land uses amount to 7 percent of the total land area, which is a larger percentage than is found in most of the city’s Planning Areas. About one percent of the land is used for industry, most on the area’s eastern edge along the CSX tracks. While the area is generally well served by commercial uses, neighborhoods on the east side lack the variety of services available on the west side. 2002.4 Parks and open spaces occupy just 7 percent of the land area in Mid-City, and most of this acreage is associated with Rock Creek Park. The remaining parks in the area are small and are very heavily used. Other public uses in the Planning Area include schools, libraries, community centers, and fire stations. These represent about 3 percent of the total area. Institutional uses consist primarily of Howard University and Howard Hospital and comprise 7 percent of the land area. 2002.5 About 2 percent of the Mid-City Planning Area, or about 36 acres, consists of vacant land. Much of this land is committed to future development projects, such as the DC-USA development and the Howard 459 Town Center. Although there are scattered vacant lots, the area is almost completely built-out. 2002.6 [Photo Caption: U Street NW] Demographics 2003 Basic demographic data for Mid-City is shown in Table 20.1. In 2000, the area had a population of 81,375 or about 14 percent of the city’s total. Population declined slightly between 1990 and 2000, although change was uneven across the Planning Area. The western part of the Planning Area added residents, but the increase was offset by decline in neighborhoods on the eastern side. 2003.1 Population is estimated to have increased to 83,100 as of 2005, largely due to new housing construction. Opposing trends are affecting household size; on the one hand, most of the new construction has consisted of one and two bedroom apartments and condominiums, with small households. On the other hand, the influx of immigrants has brought larger families to the area, often crowding into existing housing units. Current household size is 2.20, which is higher than the citywide average of 2.14. This is likely to drop in the future, as the percentage of multi-family units increases. 2003.2 AREA ELEM ENTS COMPREHENSIVE PLAN DISTRICT ELEMENTS ADOPTED 12/19/06 P. 2-124 Table 20.1: Mid-City at a Glance 2002.3 Basic Statistics Land Area (square miles) 3.1 Population 1990 81,941 2000 81,375 2005 (estimated 83,100 2025 (projected 96,500 Households (2005 35,200 Household Population (2005 excludes group quarters) 77,600 Persons Per Household (2005 2.20 Jobs (2005 28,300 Density (persons per sq mile 2005 26,800 Year 2000 Census Data Profile Mid-City Planning Area Citywide Total of Total of Total Age Under 18 15,228 18.7 20.0 18-65 59,430 73.0 67.8 Over 65 6,717 8.3 12.2 Residents Below Poverty Level 18,146 22.3 20.2 Racial Composition White 22,224 27.3 30.4 Black 42,385 52.1 60.3 Native American 402 0.5 0.3 Asian/ Pacific Islander 2,358 2.9 2.6 Other 9,891 12.2 2.8 Multi-Racial 4,115 5.1 5.2 Hispanic Origin 18,246 22.4 7.8 Foreign-Born Residents 21,166 26.0 12.8 Tenure Owner Households 10,671 31.3 40.7 Renter Households 23,462 68.7 59.3 Population 5+ yrs in same house in 2000 as in 1995 33,793 44.0 46.9 Housing Occupancy Occupied Units 34,132 89.7 90.4 Vacant Units 3,929 10.3 9.6 Housing by Unit Type 1-unit detached 1,053 2.8 13.1 1-unit attached 10,798 28.4 26.4 2-4 units 3,620 9.5 11.0 5-9 units 2,203 5.8 8.0 10-19 units 3,585 9.4 10.3 20-49 units 5,794 15.2 7.4 50+ units 10,988 28.9 23.3 Mobile/ other 21 0.1 0.2 Figures noted with an asterisk are estimates developed by the Office of Planning and the Department of Employment Services based on a variety of data sources Total population of subcategories may not match 2000 Census totals due to sampling errors. AREA ELEM ENTS 460 COMPREHENSIVE PLAN DISTRICT ELEMENTS ADOPTED 12/19/06 P. 2-125 African-Americans are the predominant racial group in the Planning Area, at approximately 52 percent. A growing Latino population stands at 22 percent, approximately three times the City’s average. Between 1990 and 2000, the Latino population increased by about 30 percent. More than one-quarter of the Mid-City’s residents are foreign-born, double the citywide average of 12.8 percent. About 27 percent of the population is non-Hispanic White, and about 3 percent are Asian or Pacific Islander. 2003.4 Relative to the city as a whole, the area has lower percentages of children and seniors. About 18 percent of the residents are under 18, compared to a citywide average of 20 percent. About 8 percent are over 65, compared to the citywide average of 12 percent. 2003.5 Housing Characteristics 2004 The 2000 Census reported that 28 percent of the area’s housing stock consisted of single family attached homes (row houses and townhouses while 44 percent consisted of apartments in multi-family buildings of 20 units or more. These are higher than the percentages for the city as a whole. Less than three percent of the homes in Mid-City were single family detached homes, significantly lower than the 13 percent for the city as a whole. In 2000, 10 percent of the housing units in Mid-City were vacant. 2004.1 [PULLQUOTE: The 2000 Census reported that 28 percent of the area’s housing stock consisted of single family attached homes (row houses and townhouses while 44 percent consisted of apartments in multifamily buildings of 20 units or more. These are higher than the percentages for the city as a whole.] The 2000 Census reported that 31 percent of the households in the Planning Area were homeowners and 69 percent were renters. The ownership rate is lower than the 41 percent rate for the city as a whole. 2004.2 Income and Employment 2005 Data from the Department of Employment Services and the Office of Planning indicates there were about 28,300 jobs in Mid-City in 2005. Major employers included Howard University and Howard Hospital, District government and public schools, and numerous retail businesses and services. District residents fill only about 44 percent of the area’s jobs. Based on 2000 Census journey-to-work data, 40 percent of the jobs in the Planning Area are filled by residents of Maryland, and about 14percent by residents of Virginia. 2005.1 There were approximately 38,000 employed residents in the Mid-City area in 2000. As of the 2000 Census, median household income in the Planning Area was $36,777, compared to a citywide median of $45,927. About nine percent of the Mid-City’s employed residents worked within the Planning Area, 36 percent commuted to Central Washington, 30 percent commuted elsewhere in Washington, and 25 percent commuted to jobs outside of the District. More than 40 percent of the area’s residents used transit to get to work, and about 17 percent walked or bicycled. 2005.2 Projections 2006 Based on approved development projects, local planning policies, and regional growth trends, Mid- City is projected to add 6,400 households during the next 20 years. Population is expected to increase by 16 percent, reaching about 96,500 in 2025. Much of the growth in the Mid-City area is expected to consist 461 of moderate to medium-density housing, particularly along 14th Street and Georgia Avenue, on land west of Howard University, and around the Metro stations at Shaw and Columbia Heights. Growth is also expected on the far eastern edge of the Planning Area, along Florida Avenue and North Capitol Streets. 2006.1 AREA ELEM ENTS COMPREHENSIVE PLAN DISTRICT ELEMENTS ADOPTED 12/19/06 P. 2-126 The number of jobs is expected to increase by about 5,000, to about 33,000 in 2025. Most of the increase is associated with development around the Columbia Heights Metro station, the Howard Town Center on Georgia Avenue; and the New York Avenue Metro station on the area’s southeastern edge. 2006.2 Planning and Development Priorities 2007 Three Comprehensive Plan workshops took place in Mid-City during 2005 and 2006. These meetings provided an opportunity for residents to discuss both citywide and neighborhood planning issues. The Advisory Neighborhood Commissions provided an important voice in this discussion, particularly on the Future Land Use Map. There have also been many meetings in the community not directly connected to the Comprehensive Plan, but relating to other planning topics. These meetings have covered topics such as public realm and transportation improvements in Columbia Heights, revitalization of Georgia Avenue, redevelopment of McMillan Reservoir, parking and traffic issues in Adams Morgan, and the arts districts along U Street and in the greater Shaw area. 2007.1 The community delivered several key messages during these meetings, summarized below: 2007.2 (a) The distinct and eclectic character that defines Mid-City neighborhoods should be protected as infill development takes place. The communities of the Mid-City welcome community reinvestment, but are worried that the rapid pace of redevelopment may be changing the fabric of the community too quickly. The loss of neighborhood diversity was the greatest concern expressed at almost every Comp Plan meeting in the Mid-City area, and was raised in many different contexts—from the need for affordable housing to concerns about the influx of chain stores and decline of neighborhood businesses. [PULLQUOTE: The communities of the Mid-City welcome community reinvestment, but are worried that the rapid pace of redevelopment may be changing the fabric of the community too quickly. The loss of neighborhood diversity was the greatest concern expressed at almost every Comp Plan meeting in the Mid-City area.] (b) Housing opportunities should be increased for people at all income levels so that Mid-City can remain a diverse neighborhood. The citywide run-up in housing prices has particularly impacted the Mid- City, as costs have soared beyond what many local residents can afford. Working families and lower income residents are being priced out of the area, and there are concerns that the community is becoming affordable only to upper income professionals. Preserving the existing stock of affordable units is important, either through rehabilitation or replacement of subsidized housing projects with new affordable units. The type of new housing being built in the area should be more varied. In particular, more three- and four-bedroom units are needed to attract and retain families. [Photo Caption: Row houses in Adams Morgan] 462 (c) New condos, apartments and commercial development should be directed to the areas that are best able to handle increased density, namely areas immediately adjacent to Metrorail stations or along high volume transit corridors. These areas are generally located around 14th and Park, along the 14th Street corridor, along U Street—especially around the Metro station, along 7th Street and Georgia Avenue—especially west of Howard University, and in the southeastern corner of the Planning Area near the New York Avenue Metro station. Mixed use development, with multi-story housing above retail shops and services, is desirable in these locations and would reinforce the Mid-City’s character as a vital, pedestrian-oriented neighborhood. AREA ELEM ENTS COMPREHENSIVE PLAN DISTRICT ELEMENTS ADOPTED 12/19/06 P. 2-127 (d) The row house fabric that defines neighborhoods like Adams Morgan, Columbia Heights, Pleasant Plains, Eckington, and Bloomingdale should be conserved. Although Mid-City includes six historic districts (Greater U Street, LeDroit Park, Mount Pleasant, Strivers’ Section, Washington Heights and Kalorama Triangle most of the row houses in Mid-City are not protected by historic district designations. Some are even zoned for high-density apartments. A variety of problems have resulted, including demolition and replacement with much larger buildings, the subdivision of row houses into multi-unit flats, and top story additions that disrupt architectural balance. Intact blocks of well-kept row houses should be zoned for row houses, and not for tall apartment buildings, and additional historic districts and/or conservation districts should be considered to protect architectural character e) The community is in dire need of additional parkland. Mid-City is the densest part of the city, but the ratio of park acreage per resident is among the lowest in the city. Rock Creek Park is a great resource, but is a long way from the eastern part of the Planning Area and is primarily a passive open space. The Area has a shortage of active play fields and recreational facilities, especially east of 16th Street. In many cases, schools are the only open spaces in the neighborhood, but access to school grounds may be restricted, and the school facilities themselves are suboptimal. Sites like the McMillan Reservoir Sand Filtration site offer the promise for additional neighborhood open space. New development there and elsewhere should set aside land for parks, while development along the area’s commercial streets and around Metro stations should include pocket parks and plazas. Throughout the community, innovative approaches such as land trusts and easements should be considered to improve open space access. [Photo Caption: The community is in dire need of additional parkland] (f) Language barriers should be broken so that more foreign-born residents can get a proper education, find suitable housing, find a decent job, and participate in community life and civic affairs. With a growing population of immigrants and non-English speaking residents, the Planning Area needs alternative education options and better access to literacy and language programs. If residents are to fill the good quality jobs to be created in the new economy, better vocational training and bilingual services are needed. Local public schools, charter schools, universities, and non-profits should be integral partners in these efforts g) The arts should be recognized as an essential part of community life. While this is true in all parts of Washington, it is especially true in the multi-cultural neighborhoods of the Mid-City. The Planning Area has been the home of many ethnic and racial groups for more than 100 years, and has long been a center of creative expression and cultural diversity. The area should celebrate its past through heritage trails and historic exhibits, and celebrate its present through indoor and outdoor 463 performance, art, and music. New cultural facilities must also be part of the area’s future h) Better economic balance should be achieved in the neighborhood. The neighborhood centers on the west side of the Mid-City Planning Area are generally successful, with strong demand for commercial space. Neighborhood business districts on the east side, particularly along Georgia Avenue and North Capitol Street, are still struggling. There are numerous vacant and boarded up properties, along with concerns about fire safety, blight, and crime. Commercial gentrification is also an issue. Small corner stores and other businesses that are unique to the neighborhood are having a harder time getting by. The area’s restaurants, ethnic establishments, and iconic neighborhood businesses are an important part of what defines this community. They should be strongly supported in the future i) Pedestrian safety, improved traffic operations, and parking management are all high priorities. Increased density within this already dense Planning Area creates busier streets – both for cars and for people. Despite its proximity to Metro, Columbia Heights will become more congested as 700 new housing units and 500,000 square feet of new retail space come on line. Parking demand will continue to AREA ELEM ENTS COMPREHENSIVE PLAN DISTRICT ELEMENTS ADOPTED 12/19/06 P. 2-128 exceed supply in Adams Morgan and Mount Pleasant. Commuter traffic along North Capitol Street and Florida Avenue will continue to burden side streets in Eckington and Bloomingdale. New solutions and strategies to traffic management are needed. Increasing transit service and improving pedestrian safety are important parts of the equation, but they must not be the only parts. [PULLQUOTE: Pedestrian safety, improved traffic operations, and parking management are all high priorities. Increased density within this already dense Planning Area creates busier streets – both for cars and for people.] (j) Public facilities in the Mid-City need improvement. Many of the area’s schools, libraries, and recreation centers are outdated and do not meet the needs of the community. At the same time, residents are concerned about proposals to use private development to leverage public facility replacement. A key concern is that public facilities are not rebuilt at the expense of neighborhood open space, which is already in very short supply. While the Mid-City has several outstanding new facilities, including the Girard Street Playground, the Columbia Heights Community Center, and Bell-Lincoln Multicultural Middle/High School, there are still unmet needs k) The Mid-City needs “greening.” This Planning Area has a very high percentage of impervious surface coverage and lost much of its tree cover during the 1970s, 80s, and 90s. Tree planting is needed to reduce urban runoff, create shade, remove air pollutants, and create beauty in the neighborhoods. Future development should incorporate green roofs and other methods to reduce resource consumption, conserve energy and water, and be more environmentally-friendly. Policies and Actions MC-1.0 General Policies MC-1.1 Guiding Growth and Neighborhood Conservation 2008 The following general policies and actions should guide growth and neighborhood conservation decisions in the Mid-City Planning Area. These policies and actions should be considered in tandem with those in the citywide elements of the Comprehensive Plan. Policies from existing Small Area Plans and Revitalization Studies (Georgia Avenue, Columbia Heights, Uptown, etc are referenced in Section MC- 464 2.0. 2008.1 Policy MC-1.1.1: Neighborhood Conservation Retain and reinforce the historic character of Mid-City neighborhoods, particularly its row houses, older apartment houses, historic districts, and walkable neighborhood shopping districts. The area’s rich architectural heritage and cultural history should be protected and enhanced. 2008.2 Policy MC-1.1.2: Directing Growth Stimulate high-quality transit-oriented development around the Columbia Heights, Shaw/Howard University, and U St./African American Civil War Memorial/Cardozo Metrorail station areas, as well as along the Georgia Avenue corridor and the North Capitol Street/ Florida Avenue business district. Opportunities for new mixed income housing, neighborhood retail, local-serving offices, and community services should be supported in these areas, as shown on the Comprehensive Plan Policy Map and Future Land Use Map. 2008.3 AREA ELEM ENTS COMPREHENSIVE PLAN DISTRICT ELEMENTS ADOPTED 12/19/06 P. 2-129 Policy MC-1.1.3: Infill and Rehabilitation Encourage redevelopment of vacant lots and the rehabilitation of abandoned structures within the community, particularly along Georgia Avenue, Florida Avenue, 11th Street, and North Capitol Street, and in the Shaw, Bloomingdale, and Eckington communities. Infill development should be compatible in scale and character with adjacent uses. 2008.4 Policy MC-1.1.4: Local Services and Small Businesses Protect the small businesses and essential local services that serve the Mid-City. Encourage the establishment of new businesses that provide these services in areas where they are lacking, especially on the east side of the Planning Area. 2008.5 [Photo Caption: African-American Civil War Memorial] Policy MC-1.1.5: Conservation of Row House Neighborhoods Recognize the value and importance of Mid-City’s row house neighborhoods as an essential part of the fabric of the local community. Ensure that the Comprehensive Plan and zoning designations for these neighborhoods reflect the desire to retain the row house pattern. Land use controls should discourage the subdivision of single family row houses into multi-unit apartment buildings but should encourage the use of English basements as separate dwelling units, in order to retain and increase the rental housing supply. 2008.6 [Photo Caption: The City should recognize the value and importance of Mid-City’s row house neighborhoods as an essential part of the fabric of the local community.] Policy MC-1.1.6: Mixed Use Districts Encourage preservation of the housing located within the Mid-City’s commercially zoned areas. Within mixed use (commercial/residential) areas, such as Mount Pleasant Street and Columbia Road, encourage commercial uses that do not adversely impact the established residential uses. 2008.7 Policy MC-1.1.7: Protection of Affordable Housing Strive to retain the character of the Mid-City as a mixed income community by protecting the area’s existing stock of affordable housing units and promoting the construction of new affordable units. 2008.8 Policy MC-1.1.8: Traffic and Parking Management Improve traffic circulation along major Mid-City arterial streets, with a priority on 14th Street, Georgia Avenue, U Street, 18th Street, Columbia Road, and Connecticut Avenue. Implement programs in 465 these areas to improve bus circulation, improve pedestrian and bicyclist safety and ease of travel, and mitigate the effects of increased traffic on residential streets. Consistent with the Transportation Element of the Comprehensive Plan, provide alternatives to automobile use—including improved transit and innovative personal transportation options—for existing and new residents to reduce the necessity of auto ownership, particularly where parking and traffic problems exist. 2008.9 See the Transportation Element for additional policies on reducing auto dependence Policy MC-1.1.9: Transit Improvements Improve public transit throughout the Mid-City Planning Area, with an emphasis on shorter headways on the north-south bus routes, additional east-west and cross-park bus routes, and more frequent and extended Metrorail service. Continue assistance programs for the area’s transit-dependent groups, including the elderly, students, and disabled. 2008.10 AREA ELEM ENTS COMPREHENSIVE PLAN DISTRICT ELEMENTS ADOPTED 12/19/06 P. 2-130 Action MC-1.1-A: Rezoning Of Row House Blocks Selectively rezone well-established residential areas where the current zoning allows densities that are well beyond the existing development pattern. The emphasis should be on row house neighborhoods that are presently zoned R-5-B or higher, which include the areas between 14th and 16th Streets NW, parts of Adams Morgan, areas between S and U Streets NW, and sections of Florida Avenue, Calvert Street, and 16th Street. 2008.11 Action MC-1.1-B: Overconcentration of Liquor-Licensed Establishments Identify the potential for regulatory controls to address the problem of excessive concentrations of liquorlicensed establishments within the neighborhood commercial districts, particularly on 18th Street and Columbia Road. 2008.12 Action MC-1.1-C: Transit Improvements Support the development of a fully integrated bus, streetcar, subway, bicycle, and pedestrian system within the Planning Area by moving forward with plans for expanded service on the Metro Green Line, extension of the Metrorail Yellow Line, and bus rapid transit on Georgia Avenue. 2008.13 Action MC-1.1-D: Off-Street Parking Support the development of off-street parking facilities in the Columbia Heights, Adams Morgan, and U Street commercial districts, and the implementation of parking management programs that maximize the use of existing parking resources (such as the Reeves Center garage minimize traffic associated with “circling” for spaces, and reduce conflicts between users. 2008.14 See the Transportation and Land Use Elements for additional policies on off-street parking standards MC-1.2 Conserving and Enhancing Community Resources 2009 Policy MC-1.2.1: Cultural Diversity Maintain the cultural diversity of the Mid-City by encouraging housing and business opportunities for all residents, sustaining a strong network of social services for immigrant groups, and retaining affordable housing within the Planning Area. 2009.1 [ADD SIDEBAR QUOTE: “The Comprehensive Plan cannot begin to express the pride the community feels in its diversity and how important it is to the fabric of many Mid-City neighborhoods. Any 466 future action and programs must honor and respect this diversitry of culture, economics, race, and ethnicity.” ANC1A, October 2006 Hearing Testimony .] Policy MC-1.2.2: English Language Programs and Vocational Training Work with established institutions such as public schools, charter schools, and Howard University to support alternative education and vocational training options for non-English speaking residents. 2009.2 Policy MC-1.2.3: Rock Creek Park Improve community access from the Mid-City area to Rock Creek Park. Work with the National Park Service to explore opportunities for new recreational amenities in the park that reduce the deficit of open space and recreational facilities in the Mid-City. 2009.3 Policy MC-1.2.4: New Parks Explore the possibility for new neighborhood parks within the Mid-City area, particularly in the area around the proposed Howard Town Center, and on the McMillan Reservoir site. Additionally, pocket parks and plazas such as those planned for the Columbia Heights Metro station area should be encouraged elsewhere in the Planning Area, particularly near higher density development. The dearth of parks in the AREA ELEM ENTS COMPREHENSIVE PLAN DISTRICT ELEMENTS ADOPTED 12/19/06 P. 2-131 Mid-City area is a serious problem that must be addressed as its population grows—all recreation areas must be retained and new recreation areas must be provided wherever possible. 2009.4 Policy MC-1.2.5: Neighborhood Greening Undertake neighborhood greening and planting projects throughout the Mid-City Area, particularly on median strips, public triangles, and along sidewalk planting strips. 2009.5 Policy MC-1.2.6: Mid-City Historic Resources Protect the historic resources of the Mid-City area, with particular attention to neighborhoods that are currently not protected by historic district designation.

The design integrity of the bridges shall be preserved, and Meridian Hill/ Malcolm X Park and the area around it shall be managed to preserve historic vistas and view corridors, as well as historic park features. 2009.6 Action MC-1.2-A: Conservation Districts: Consider the designation of Columbia Heights, Eckington, Bloomingdale, and other Mid-City neighborhoods as “Conservation Districts.” Design standards and review procedures for such districts would be less rigorous than those used in Historic Districts, but would strive for more compatible infill development and maintenance of historic building scale, mass, and height conditions. 2009.7 Action MC-1.2-B: Library Expansion Modernize and upgrade the Mount Pleasant Branch Library, including expansion of library services. As funding allows, consider development of a new library in the eastern portion of Columbia Heights. 2009.8 Action MC-1.2-C: Recreation Center Pursue development of a new recreation center in the eastern part of the Planning Area, serving the Bloomingdale/ Eckington/ LeDroit Park community. This area was recognized to be particularly deficient for such uses in the 2006 Parks Master Plan. 2009.9 MC-2.0 Policy Focus Areas 2010 The Comprehensive Plan has identified seven areas in Mid-City as “policy focus areas,” indicating 467 that they require a level of direction and guidance above that provided by the prior sections of this Area Element and in the citywide elements (see Map 20.1 and Table 20.2 These areas are: Georgia Avenue Corridor 14th Street Corridor Columbia Heights U Street/ Uptown 18th Street and Columbia Road Mount Pleasant Street McMillan Sand Filtration Site North Capitol Street/ Florida Av/ New York Avenue 2010.1 The Rock Creek East Element (Chapter 22) should be consulted for policies and actions on the reuse of the Armed Forces Retirement Home.

As a traffic artery, it carries thousands of commuters in and out of the city daily. As a commercial corridor, it provides goods and services to residents in neighborhoods like LeDroit Park, Pleasant Plains, and Park View. Yet today, the avenue is in need of revival. Despite its distinctive building stock and the strong housing market around it, the avenue still has pockets of crime, deteriorating commercial and residential properties, a steady increase of automobile-oriented businesses, and declining infrastructure and public space. 2011.1 AREA ELEM ENTS COMPREHENSIVE PLAN DISTRICT ELEMENTS ADOPTED 12/19/06 P. 2-133 468 Several planning initiatives have been launched for the Georgia Avenue corridor during the past five years. In 2005, the Office of Planning completed a Revitalization Strategy for the portion of the corridor extending from Euclid Street on the south to Decatur Street on the north. Below Euclid, much of the street frontage is controlled by Howard University and is addressed in the Howard Campus Plan. The University’s plans include joint development of Howard Town Center, a large mixed use residential and retail project. The University also has launched the “LeDroit Park Initiative”to spur improvement and reinvestment in the surrounding neighborhood. South of Barry Place, Georgia Avenue/7th Street is contained within the Strategic Development Plan for the Uptown Destination District. The entire corridor is also one of the city’s designated “Great Streets.” 2011.2 Although these initiatives cover different sections of the corridor, they share common goals. These include revitalization through strategic growth and development, preservation of historic assets and unique architecture, improvement of the streetscape and public space, creation of new housing and job opportunities, and upgrading of public transit. Such initiatives are bolstered through efforts by local faith-based institutions to provide family support and job training services in the community. 2011.3 Plans for Georgia Avenue seek to attract quality neighborhood-serving retail businesses and services, reduce vacancies, and explore shared parking strategies to meet parking demand. A number of specific actions have been recommended, including creation of an overlay zone to encourage redevelopment, market incentives such as tax increment financing, façade improvement programs, and targeted improvements on blocks with high vacancies. New parking lots or structures are suggested on specific sites along the corridor, and pedestrian safety measures such as more visible crosswalks and improved lighting have been proposed. The Georgia Avenue Revitalization Strategy includes an “Action Plan,” to initiate and monitor these measures. 2011.4 [Photo Caption: Lower Georgia Avenue] Policy MC-2.1.1: Revitalization of Lower Georgia Avenue Encourage continued revitalization of the Lower Georgia Avenue corridor. Georgia Avenue should be an attractive, pedestrian-oriented “Main Street” with retail uses, local-serving offices, mixed income housing, civic and cultural facilities, and well-maintained public space. 2011.5 Policy MC-2.1.2: Segmenting the Corridor Develop distinct identities for different segments of the Georgia Avenue Corridor. Within the Mid- City area, these should include a ParkView/Park Morton section (Otis to Irving a Pleasant Plains section (Irving to Euclid a Howard University section (Euclid to Barry Place and the Uptown Arts District (Barry Place southward 2011.6 Policy MC-2.1.3: Georgia Avenue Design Improvements Upgrade the visual quality of the Georgia Avenue corridor through urban design and public space improvements, including tree planting, new parks and plazas, upgrading of triangle parks, and façade improvements that establish a stronger identity and improved image. 2011.7 Policy MC-2.1.4: Howard University Encourage and strongly support continued relationship-building between Howard University and the adjacent residential neighborhoods. Work with Howard University in the abatement of any outstanding community issues such as the redevelopment of vacant-owned property, façade/building enhancements, and buffering issues associated with campus expansion. Stimulate joint development opportunities with the University that benefit students and surrounding residents. 2011.8 AREA ELEM ENTS COMPREHENSIVE PLAN DISTRICT ELEMENTS ADOPTED 12/19/06 P. 2-134 Action MC-2.1-A: Georgia Avenue Revitalization Strategy 469 Implement the recommendations of the 2004 Revitalization Strategy for the Georgia Avenue and Petworth Metro Station Area and Corridor Plan. 2011.9 Action MC-2.1-B: Howard Town Center Develop a new mixed use neighborhood center on land to the west of Howard University Campus. This should include not only the planned Howard Town Center site (with housing, retail, and structured parking but additional medium-density housing development, civic space, cultural facilities, and public open space on surrounding sites. Appropriate transitions in scale should be established between this center and the lower density row house neighborhoods to the west. 2011.10 Action MC-2.1-C: Great Streets Improvements Implement the Great Streets initiative recommendations for Georgia Avenue, including transit improvements, façade improvements, upgraded infrastructure, blight abatement, and incentives for housing and business development along the avenue. 2011.11 Action MC-2.1-D: Park Morton New Community Pursue redevelopment of Park Morton as a “new community”, replacing the existing public housing development with an equivalent number of new public housing units, plus new market-rate and “workforce” housing units, to create a new mixed income community. Consider implementing this recommendation in tandem with plans for the reuse of public land on Spring Road. Ensure that every effort possible is made to avoid permanent displacement of residents if this action is followed. 2011.12 Action MC-2.1-E: Reuse of Bruce School Encourage the reuse of the vacant Bruce School (Kenyon Street) as a neighborhood-serving public facility, such as a library, recreation facility, education center for youth and adults, or vocational training center, rather than using the site for private purposes. Open space on the site should be retained for community use. 2011.13 Action MC-2.1-F: Senior Wellness Center Develop a Senior Wellness Center on the Lower Georgia Avenue corridor to meet the current and future needs of area residents. MC-2.2 14th Street Corridor Columbia Heights 2012 14th Street is in the midst of an urban renaissance, with hundreds of new housing units under construction and new ground floor retail businesses opening on almost every block between Rhode Island Avenue and Park Road. Once a major commercial thoroughfare, the corridor was hard hit by the 1968 riots, and many of its buildings sat vacant for more than 30 years. 2012.1 [PULLQUOTE: 14th Street is in the midst of an urban renaissance, with hundreds of new housing units under construction and new ground floor retail businesses opening on almost every block between Rhode Island Avenue and Park Road. Once a major commercial thoroughfare, the corridor was hard hit by the 1968 riots, and many of its buildings sat vacant for more than 30 years.] Much of the recent activity has focused on the Columbia Heights Metro Station area. The commercial district around 14th and Park Streets was initially developed in the early 1900s as a transit-oriented commercial center, anchored by the now-historic Riggs Bank (now PNC) and Tivoli Theater on the northwest and northeast corners. In 1997, a series of community workshops was held to create a redevelopment strategy for the area, ultimately targeting several major parcels owned by the Redevelopment Land Agency (RLA) around the Metro station. 2012.2 AREA ELEM ENTS COMPREHENSIVE PLAN DISTRICT ELEMENTS ADOPTED 12/19/06 P. 2-135 The 1997 effort led to another initiative several years later, which culminated in the 2004 Columbia Heights Public Realm Framework Plan. The Framework Plan was developed to enhance public space in 470 the Metro station vicinity. The Plan was coordinated with plans for private development on adjacent properties which when completed will add over 600 new housing units, approximately 650,000 square feet of retail space, 30,000 square feet of office space, and 2,000 parking spaces. The Framework Plan also incorporated connections to the new 800-student Bell Lincoln Middle and High School and Multi- Cultural Center, as well as other cultural and civic uses nearby. 2012.3 The goal of the Columbia Heights Public Realm Framework is to make the neighborhood more pedestrian friendly, coordinate infrastructure improvements, and create a stronger civic identity for Columbia Heights. Its recommendations include a new civic plaza, paving and streetscape improvements, tree planting, public art, and reconfiguration of streets and intersections to improve pedestrian and vehicle safety. 2012.4 South of Columbia Heights, medium-density mixed use development is proposed on many blocks extending south from Irving Street to U Street. Redevelopment over the next ten years will reshape the corridor from auto-oriented commercial uses, including several “strip” shopping centers and warehouses, to an attractive urban residential street. Special efforts should be made to refurbish and preserve subsidized housing along the corridor, and to establish appropriate transitions in scale and density between the corridor and the less dense residential areas on the west and east. Strengthening of the 11th Street neighborhood commercial district, located several blocks east of Columbia Heights, also should be encouraged. With the opening of the DC-USA project and other large-scale retail development near the Columbia Heights Metrorail station, programs to assist the existing small businesses in this area may be needed. 2012.5 [Photo Caption: Columbia Heights Metrorail Station] The construction of hundreds of new housing units and one of the largest retail complexes in the city will have significant traffic impacts on Columbia Heights during the coming years. East-west traffic flow through the area is particularly problematic, since many of the east-west streets are residential in character and are already congested. Blocked travel lanes, double-parking, poorly marked lanes, angled intersections and poorly timed traffic signals contribute to the problem. Although DDOT completed a traffic study for the area in 2003 and identified potential transportation improvements, there is a need for additional traffic analysis to evaluate the impacts of planned development and develop appropriate mitigation measures. The goal of these measures should not be to increase vehicle speed on the east- west streets, but rather to improve mobility through the area and reduce the adverse effects of traffic on residents and businesses. 2012.6 Policy MC-2.2.1: Columbia Heights Metro Station Area Development Develop the Columbia Heights Metro Station area as a thriving mixed use community center, anchored by mixed income housing, community-serving retail, offices, civic uses, and public plazas. Strive to retain the neighborhood’s extraordinary cultural diversity as development takes place, and place a priority on development and services that meet the needs of local residents. 2012.7 Policy MC-2.2.2: Public Realm Improvements Improve the streets, sidewalks, and public rights-of-way in the 14th/Park vicinity to improve pedestrian safety and create a more attractive public environment. 2012.8 AREA ELEM ENTS 471 COMPREHENSIVE PLAN DISTRICT ELEMENTS ADOPTED 12/19/06 P. 2-136 Policy MC-2.2.3: Pocket Parks Pursue opportunities to create new publicly-accessible open space in Columbia Heights and to increase community access to public school open space during non-school hours. 2012.9 Policy MC-2.2.4: Traffic and Parking Management Improve bus, pedestrian, bicycle, and vehicular movement; parking management; and pedestrian safety along the 14th Street corridor while balancing the transportation and traffic needs of adjacent crossstreets. Undertake transportation improvement programs to sustain the additional residential, retail and institutional development that is now under construction or planned around the Columbia Heights Metro station. These improvements should achieve a balanced multi-modal system that meets the needs of pedestrians, bicyclists, transit users, and motorists. 2012.10 Policy MC-2.2.5: 11th Street Commercial District Retain the 11th Street corridor between Kenyon and Monroe Streets as a neighborhood shopping district. Preserve the mixed use character of the corridor and encourage new local-serving retail businesses and housing. 2012.11 Policy MC-2.2.6: Mid-14th Street Commercial District Support ongoing efforts to strengthen the small businesses on Park Road and businesses on 14th Street between Newton Street and Shepherd Street, through façade improvements, technical assistance, enhanced public infrastructure, and other measures to sustain a thriving business community that serves the surrounding neighborhood. 2012.12 Action MC-2.2-A: Columbia Heights Public Realm Framework Plan Implement the Columbia Heights Public Realm Framework Plan, including the installation of unique lighting and street furniture, improvement of sidewalks, tree planting, public art, and construction of a civic plaza along 14th Street at Park Road and Kenyon Street. Streetscape improvements should include not only the 14th Street corridor, but gateway points throughout Columbia Heights. 2012.13 [Photo Caption: Proposed civic plaza at 14th Street and Park Road NW in Columbia Heights (illustrative)] Action MC-2.2-B: Park Improvements Upgrade and re-design small neighborhood pocket parks within Columbia Heights, especially at Monroe and 11th Street, and at Oak/Ogden/14th Streets. 2012.14 Action MC-2.2-C: Mount Pleasant/Columbia Heights Transportation Improvements Implement the recommendations of the Mount Pleasant/Columbia Heights Transportation Study, including traffic calming measures for the Columbia Heights community. Update the Study recommendations as needed based on follow-up analysis of projected traffic conditions in the area. The updated study should address alternative routing of east-west traffic to reduce impacts on residential streets. 2012.15 MC-2.3 U Street/ Uptown 2013 U Street and the adjacent Cardozo and Shaw neighborhoods are an important part of the city’s African- American cultural history. African Americans first settled in the neighborhood in the 1880s, capitalizing on new streetcar lines and the absence of residential segregation rules. By the 1920s, the neighborhood had become the center of African American life in Washington. Black-owned theaters, restaurants, night clubs, billiard parlors, and dance halls extended along U Street from 7th Street to 14th Street. During 472 its heyday, legendary jazz greats like Duke Ellington, Louis Armstrong, Dizzy Gillespie, and Pearl Bailey AREA ELEM ENTS COMPREHENSIVE PLAN DISTRICT ELEMENTS ADOPTED 12/19/06 P. 2-137 performed at U Street venues. Today, the neighborhood is home to the African-American Civil War Memorial and Museum, and an African-American Heritage Trail that commemorates important historic landmarks in Black history. 2013.1 U Street has been in transition for the past decade. Some of the area’s historic venues have been restored, and a new generation of restaurants and nightclubs is emerging. Hundreds of new housing units have been added, particularly west of 12th Street. The neighborhood has become more socially, culturally and economically mixed. The downside of U Street’s success is that many of the long-time businesses, including basic services like barber shops and bookstores, are having difficulty paying the higher rents and taxes that have come with gentrification. Efforts to retain the street’s character must do more than just preserve its buildings; measures to retain and assist existing businesses are needed. 2013.2 In 2004, the District completed a Strategic Development Plan for the Uptown Destination District (called “DUKE” focusing on the area along U Street between 6th Street and 13th Street and along 7th Street/ Georgia Avenue between Rhode Island Avenue and Barry Place. The Plan proposes revival of these blocks as a cultural destination, anchored by a restored Howard Theater, new retail and entertainment uses along 7th and U Streets, outdoor performance space, and up to 800 new housing units on vacant and/or underutilized sites. Office and hotel uses also are discussed as possible uses, capitalizing on the proximity to Howard University. 2013.3 [Photo Caption: U Street NW] The confluence of a strong real estate market, an excellent location near Metro and Howard University, and the desire of several government agencies to develop their vacant properties, will catalyze this area’s redevelopment during the next decade. The DUKE Plan focuses on 16 publicly-owned sites, including sites owned by the District, WMATA, the Housing Finance Agency, and the Redevelopment Land Agency. It also addresses sites owned by Howard University and the private sector within the study area. As development takes place, continued efforts to improve the streetscape and public space, provide affordable housing, preserve historic buildings, and mitigate development impacts (particularly those associated with the increased concentration of restaurants, night clubs and entertainment uses) should be included. 2013.4 [PULLQUOTE: The confluence of a strong real estate market, an excellent location near Metro and Howard University, and the desire of several government agencies to develop their vacant properties, will catalyze this area’s redevelopment during the next decade.] Policy MC-2.3.1: Uptown Destination District Encourage the redevelopment of U Street between 6th Street and 12th Street NW, and Georgia Avenue/7th Street between Rhode Island Avenue and Barry Place NW as a mixed use residential/commercial center, with restored theaters, arts and jazz establishments, restaurants, and shops, as well as housing serving a range of incomes and household types. 2013.5 Policy EW-2.3.2: Uptown Subareas Create a distinct and memorable identity for different sub-areas in the Uptown District, based on existing 473 assets such as the Lincoln Theater, Howard University, the African-American Civil War Memorial, and the Howard Theater. 2013.6 Policy MC-2.3.3: Uptown Design Considerations Ensure that development in the Uptown Area is designed to make the most of its proximity to the Metro Stations at Shaw and 13th Street, to respect the integrity of historic resources, and to transition as seamlessly as possible to the residential neighborhoods nearby. 2013.7 AREA ELEM ENTS COMPREHENSIVE PLAN DISTRICT ELEMENTS ADOPTED 12/19/06 P. 2-138 Policy MC-2.3.4: Cultural Tourism Promote cultural tourism initiatives, public art, signage, and other improvements that recognize the African-American historical and cultural heritage of the Uptown area. Such initiatives should bring economic development opportunities to local residents and businesses, and establish a stronger identity for the area as a nationally significant African-American landmark. 2013.8 Policy MC-2.3.5: Parking and Traffic Management Encourage the development of shared parking facilities in the Uptown area, better management of existing parking resources, and improved surface transit to manage the increased parking demand that will be generated by new development. 2013.9 Policy MC-2.3.6: Small Business Retention Incorporate small business retention and assistance programs in the Uptown District’s revitalization, possibly including zoning regulations, tax relief, and other measures which assist small businesses as redevelopment along U Street, 9th Street, and 7th Street takes place. 2013.10 Action MC-2.3-A: Duke Development Framework Small Area Plan Implement the DUKE Strategic Development Framework Plan to establish a destination-oriented mixed use development program for key vacant and existing historic sites between the historic Lincoln and Howard Theatres. 2013.11 Action MC-2.3-B: U Street/Shaw/Howard University Multi-Modal Transportation and Parking Study Implement the recommendations of the U Street/Shaw/Howard University Multi-Modal Transportation and Parking Study to provided improved parking management, traffic safety and mobility, transit accessibility, pedestrian and bicycle safety, and streetscape design. 2013.12 See the Near Northwest Area Element for a discussion of the Shaw/Convention Center Area Plan MC-2.4 18th Street/Columbia Road 2014 In the late 19th and early 20th century, Adams Morgan was a fashionable suburb of row houses and elegant apartments. During World War II, many of its homes were divided into apartments (or used as rooming houses changing the character of the neighborhood. A large number of young adults and immigrants settled in the neighborhood in the post-war years. A new name for the community was coined by community activists, combining the names of two neighborhood schools—the predominantly white Adams and the predominantly black Morgan. 2014.1 In the 1950s and early 1960s, the neighborhood saw an influx of Cubans and Puerto Ricans. In the 1980s, waves of immigrants from Central America arrived, many seeking refuge from political and economic turmoil. Today, Adams Morgan has the second largest Salvadoran population in the United States. The neighborhood’s colorful street murals, first painted by Latinos in the 1970s, are now a Washington tradition and are emulated throughout the city. The commercial district along 18th Street and Columbia Road has become a center of Washington nightlife, with an array of ethnic restaurants, coffee houses, bars, and funky shops that attract people from across the region, as well as visitors to the city. 2014.2 [Adams Morgan commercial district] 474 The neighborhood continues to experience growing pains as it grapples with strong demand for housing and the popularity of its entertainment scene. To the east of 18th Street, a zoning overlay was created for the Reed-Cooke area in 1989 to protect existing housing and ensure compatible infill development on a number of large properties. Several large low-rise condominium projects were developed in the 1990s AREA ELEM ENTS COMPREHENSIVE PLAN DISTRICT ELEMENTS ADOPTED 12/19/06 P. 2-139 and early 2000s, and today there are plans for a new grocery store in the former Citadel skating rink. 2014.3 [PULLQUOTE: The neighborhood continues to experience growing pains as it grapples with strong demand for housing and the popularity of its entertainment scene.] Elsewhere in the neighborhood, there are still concerns about the conversion of row houses to apartments, over concentration of bars, the loss of affordable housing units, and inadequate buffering between residential and commercial uses. Public-private redevelopment of the Marie Reed School campus is currently under consideration. The project provides an opportunity for a new school and community facility—and possibly new affordable housing, but has raised concerns about additional density, congestion, and the loss of open space. The continued strong involvement of the Advisory Neighborhood Commission, local community organizations, and individual residents will be important as these conflicts and challenges are addressed. 2014.4 Policy MC-2.4.1: Protecting the Character of Adams Morgan Protect the historic character of the Adams Morgan community through historic landmark and district designations, and by ensuring that new construction is consistent with the prevailing heights and densities in the neighborhood. 2014.5 Policy MC-2.4.2: Preference for Local-Serving Businesses Enhance the local-serving, multi-cultural character of the 18th Street/ Columbia Road business district. Encourage small businesses that meet the needs of local residents, rather than convenience stores, largescale commercial uses, and concentrations of liquor-licensed establishments. Consistent with this policy, the conversion of restaurants to night clubs or taverns and the expansion of existing night clubs or taverns into adjacent buildings should be discouraged. 2014.6 Policy MC-2.4.3: Mixed Use Character Encourage retention of the older mixed use buildings along 18th Street and Columbia Road and facilitate infill projects which complement them in height, scale, and design. Discourage conversion of existing apartment buildings in the commercial area to non-residential uses, and ensure that the long-term viability of these uses is not threatened by the encroachment of incompatible uses. 2014.7 Policy MC-2.4.4: Transportation Improvements Improve traffic movement, accessibility, and the flow of people along key arterial streets, particularly along 18th Street and Columbia Road and residential connector streets such as Kalorama Road and Euclid Street. Implement new measures to address parking problems on residential streets near the Adams Morgan business district. These measures could include extension of the residential permit parking program to a “24/7” timeframe, with appropriate consideration given to the needs of residents, businesses, and visitors. 2014.8 Policy MC-2.4.5: Reed-Cooke Area Protect existing housing within the Reed Cooke neighborhood, maintaining heights and densities at 475 appropriate levels and encouraging small-scale business development that does not adversely affect the residential community. 2014.9 Policy MC-2.4.6: Adams Morgan Public and Institutional Facilities Encourage the retention and adaptive reuse of existing public facilities in Adams Morgan, including the use of schools for public purposes such as education, clinics, libraries, and recreational facilities. In addition, encourage the constructive, adaptive and suitable reuse of historic churches with new uses such as housing in the event such facilities cease to operate as churches. 2014.10 AREA ELEM ENTS COMPREHENSIVE PLAN DISTRICT ELEMENTS ADOPTED 12/19/06 P. 2-140 Action MC-2.4-A: 18th Street/Adams Morgan Transportation and Parking Study Work closely with the Advisory Neighborhood Commission and community to implement appropriate recommendations of the 18th Street/Adams Morgan Transportation and Parking Study, which was prepared to better manage vehicle traffic, pedestrian and bicycle movement, on-street and off-street parking, and streetscape improvements along 18th Street and in the surrounding area of Adams Morgan. Appropriate recommendations are those on which a consensus can be developed, and those on which consensus may not be achieved but where the views and comments of all stakeholders have been duly considered and discussed. 2014.11 Action MC-2.4-B: Washington Heights and Lanier Heights Support the designation of the Washington Heights area as a National Register Historic District. Conduct additional historical surveys and consider historic district designations for other areas around Adams Morgan, including Lanier Heights, portions of Reed-Cooke, the 16th Street area, and Walter Pierce Community Park. 2014.12 Action MC-2.4-C: Marie H. Reed Community Learning Center Continue the community dialogue on the reuse of the Marie H. Reed Community Learning Center to determine the feasibility of modernizing the school, improving the playing fields and recreational facilities, and providing enhanced space for the health clinic and other community services. This dialogue should be undertaken in the context of addressing present and future local public facility needs, open space needs, school enrollment and program needs, and the community’s priorities for the site. 2014.13 Action MC-2.4-D: Local Business Assistance Explore the feasibility of amending tax laws or developing tax abatement and credit programs to retain neighborhood services and encourage small local-serving businesses space along 18th Street and Columbia Road. 2014.14 See also Action MC-1.1-A regarding the rezoning of row house blocks. MC-2.5 Mount Pleasant Street 2015 The Mount Pleasant Street shopping district was developed around the end of a streetcar line and has served the surrounding community for more than a century. Mount Pleasant has been a designated National Register Historic District since 1987 and is one of 12 DC “Main Streets.” Today, the commercial district includes a variety of small businesses and services, many oriented toward the large Latino population in the area. The area between Mount Pleasant Street and 16th Street is one of the densest in the city, with numerous large apartment complexes. 2015.1 There is broad agreement that Mount Pleasant Street should remain a culturally diverse, pedestrianoriented local-serving shopping street in the future, and that the local flavor of the business mix should be protected. As in other Mid-City neighborhoods, there are concerns about rising rents and the loss of business diversity. There is strong interest in attracting new arts establishments and locally-owned restaurants to the neighborhood, and promoting multi-culturalism through outdoor fairs, public art, and street performances. There is also strong interest in protecting the architectural integrity and historic 476 proportions of Mount Pleasant’s residential streets, and in acquiring additional open space for public access and community use. 2015.2 AREA ELEM ENTS COMPREHENSIVE PLAN DISTRICT ELEMENTS ADOPTED 12/19/06 P. 2-141 [PULLQUOTE: There is broad agreement that Mount Pleasant Street should remain a culturally diverse, pedestrian-oriented local-serving shopping street in the future, and that the local flavor of the business mix should be protected.] Opinions on the extent of new development that should be accommodated along Mount Pleasant Street itself are mixed. Some residents strongly desire denser mixed-use development, with new affordable and market rate housing above retail space. Others remain concerned about the impacts of additional density on traffic, parking, and historic character, and the effects of retail and restaurant growth on nearby residential uses. A continued dialogue on growth and development issues will be necessary to find the right balance. 2015.3 Policy MC-2.5.1: Mount Pleasant Street’s Character Maintain and preserve the local neighborhood shopping character of Mount Pleasant Street to better serve the surrounding neighborhood. Support creative cultural design while protecting historic landmarks. 2015.4 Policy MC-2.5.2: Involving the International Community Promote bilingual outreach and communication with local merchants and residents to more effectively address business impacts and create a better match between neighborhood businesses and the needs of the community. 2015.5 Policy MC-2.5.3: Mount Pleasant As a Creative Economic Enclave Support creative and multi-cultural expression in Mount Pleasant through display, performance, festivals, and economic development strategies. The neighborhood should be a creative economic enclave, where incubators and small businesses that combine cultural and small-scale technological initiatives are supported. Cultural arts should be more fully integrated into the landscape of Mount Pleasant Street and should be part of the experience of living or shopping there. Additional arts, crafts, galleries, licensed market vendors, and space for business incubators and consulting services in the creative professions should be encouraged. 2015.6 Policy MC-2.5.4: Open Space Access Pursue improvements to existing open space in the Mount Pleasant community, including better connections to Rock Creek Park, enhancements to pocket parks and plazas, and encouraging the joint use of school facilities to meet local recreational needs. 2015.7 Policy MC-2.5.5: Promoting Affordable Housing in Mount Pleasant Protect existing affordable housing in Mount Pleasant and support opportunities for new affordable housing as a component of mixed use infill development along Mount Pleasant Street and in the area between Mount Pleasant Street and 16th Street. 2015.8 Action MC-2.5-A: Incentives for Mixed Use Development and Affordable Housing Consider planning and zoning tools in Mount Pleasant to create incentives for ground floor retail and upper story residential uses along Mount Pleasant Street, with performance standards that ensure the compatibility of adjacent uses. Provide the necessary flexibility to encourage innovation and creative economic development, possibly including ground floor small businesses on alleys and walkways in the area between 16th and 17th Streets. 2015.9 Action MC-2.5-B: Expanding Mount Pleasant Open Space 477 Restore access to the Bell Lincoln recreational facilities and ensure continued public access to (and restoration of) the Department of Parks and Recreation Headquarters property and playground on 16th Street for the benefit of residents of the surrounding community, including Mount Pleasant and Columbia AREA ELEM ENTS COMPREHENSIVE PLAN DISTRICT ELEMENTS ADOPTED 12/19/06 P. 2-142 Heights.

Once used to filter drinking water from the Potomac River, the plant was closed and sold by the federal government to the District of Columbia for “community development purposes” in 1987. The site currently appears as an open area of grass and trees with two rows of enigmatic concrete towers covered with ivy. Beneath the surface are 20 unreinforced concrete filter cells, each one acre in size and in various states of disrepair. The entire site is considered historically significant. When the filtration system was created in 1905, it was considered an engineering marvel and a model for other plants nationwide. 2016.1 The McMillan site has been the subject of community forums for nearly 20 years. Many residents have advocated for a park on the site, noting its historic significance. In fact, the filtration site and the adjacent McMillan reservoir were part of the Emerald Necklace of parks conceived in the 1901 McMillan Plan, and the site itself was originally designed by Frederick Law Olmsted, Jr. Past proposals for the site have been the subject of lawsuits, and the Comprehensive Plan designation of the site for mixed use development was itself the subject of a lawsuit in 1989-92. 2016.2 The District conducted planning workshops for the site in 2000 to explore potential new uses. Several options were considered, including a community park, a retail-hotel complex, and a mixed use residentialretail scenario. Each of the options dedicated a substantial portion of the site as parkland. In 2004, an unsolicited proposal to build 1,200 units of housing on the site was made by a private developer. In 2005, the site was transferred from the District to the National Capital Revitalization Corporation (NCRC NCRC is currently developing plans for the property. 2016.3 Whatever the outcome, several basic objectives should be pursued in the re-use of the McMillan Sand Filtration site. These are outlined in the policies below. 2016.4 [Photo Caption: McMillan Reservoir Sand Filtration Site] Policy MC-2.6.1: Open Space on McMillan Reservoir Sand Filtration Site Require that reuse plans for the McMillan Reservoir Sand Filtration site dedicate a substantial contiguous portion of the site for recreation and open space. The open space should provide for both active and passive recreational uses, and should adhere to high standards of landscape design, accessibility, and security. Consistent with the 1901 McMillan Plan, connectivity to nearby open spaces such as the Armed 478 Forces Retirement Home, should be achieved through site design. 2016.5 Policy MC-2.6.2: Historic Preservation at McMillan Reservoir Restore key above-ground elements of the site in a manner that is compatible with the original plan, and explore the adaptive reuse of some of the underground “cells” as part of the historic record of the site. The cultural significance of this site, and its importance to the history of the District of Columbia must be recognized as it is reused. Consideration should be given to monuments, memorials, and museums as part of the site design. 2016.6 AREA ELEM ENTS COMPREHENSIVE PLAN DISTRICT ELEMENTS ADOPTED 12/19/06 P. 2-143 Policy MC-2.6.3: Mitigating Reuse Impacts Ensure that any development on the site is designed to reduce parking, traffic, and noise impacts on the community; be architecturally compatible with the surrounding community; and improve transportation options to the site and surrounding neighborhood. Any change in use on the site should increase connectivity between Northwest and Northeast neighborhoods as well as the hospital complex to the north. 2016.7 Policy MC-2.6.4: Community Involvement in Reuse Planning Be responsive to community needs and concerns in reuse planning for the site. Amenities which are accessible to the community and which respond to neighborhood needs should be included. 2016.8 Policy MC-2.6.5: Scale and Mix of New Uses Recognize that development on portions of the McMillan Sand Filtration site may be necessary to stabilize the site and provide the desired open space and amenities. Where development takes place, it should consist of moderate- to medium-density housing, retail, and other compatible uses. Any development on the site should maintain viewsheds and vistas and be situated in a way that minimizes impacts on historic resources and adjacent development. 2016.9 Action MC-2.6-A: McMillan Reservoir Development Continue working with the National Capital Revitalization Corporation and adjacent communities in the development and implementation of reuse plans for the McMillan Reservoir Sand Filtration site. 2016.10 MC-2.7 North Capitol Street Florida/ New York Avenue Business District 2017 The area around the North Capitol Street, New York Avenue, and Florida Avenue intersections provides the commercial center for the surrounding Bloomingdale, Eckington, and Truxton Circle neighborhoods. The neighborhoods themselves are diverse in age, income, and ethnicity. They consist of a mix of row houses and small apartment buildings. Home prices in the neighborhood have tripled since 2000, and many long-time residents are feeling the pressure of gentrification. 2017.1 [PULLQUOTE: Home prices in the Bloomingdale, Eckington, and Truxton Circle neighborhoods have tripled since 2000, and many long-time residents are feeling the pressure of gentrification.] The commercial district itself is in need of revitalization. Although it was designated a DC Main Street in 2000, it suffers from a lack of neighborhood-serving businesses, high vacancies, crime, and inadequate access and parking. The North Capitol frontage is particularly challenged by a myriad of confusing and often congested intersections, and crisscrossing diagonal streets and triangles that making pedestrian movement difficult. The District addressed these issues in a transportation study in 2004-2005, with the 479 goal of improving vehicle flow and improving safety. The Study explored the feasibility of reconstructing Truxton Circle (at North Capitol and Florida and identified specific short-term and longterm transportation, streetscape, and infrastructure improvements. 2017.2 The North Capitol commercial district is just a few blocks west of the New York Avenue Metro station and lies on the northern edge of the North-of-Massachusetts-Avenue (NOMA) district. Conditions on the corridor are likely to change dramatically as NOMA is redeveloped with offices and high-density housing. The commercial district is well situated to benefit from these changes, but first needs a strategy to address the needs of the residential community, manage traffic, upgrade the public realm, and improve public safety. 2017.3 AREA ELEM ENTS COMPREHENSIVE PLAN DISTRICT ELEMENTS ADOPTED 12/19/06 P. 2-144 Policy MC-2.7.1: North Capitol/ Florida Business District Upgrade the commercial district at Florida Avenue/ North Capitol/ New York Avenue, restoring vacant storefronts to active use and accommodating compatible neighborhood-serving infill development. 2017.4 Policy MC-2.7.2: Eckington/ Bloomingdale Protect the architectural integrity of the Eckington/ Bloomingdale neighborhood, and encourage the continued restoration and improvement of the area’s row houses. 2017.5 Action MC-2.7-A: North Capitol Revitalization Strategy Prepare a Small Area Plan/ Revitalization Strategy for the North Capitol/ Florida Avenue business district, including recommendations for streetscape improvements, land use and zoning changes, parking management and pedestrian safety improvements, retail development, and opportunities for new housing and public services. 2017.6 Action MC-2.7-B: Conservation District Consider the designation of the Eckington/ Bloomingdale/ Truxton Circle neighborhood as a Conservation District, recognizing that most of its structures are 80-100 years old and may require additional design guidance to ensure the compatibility of alterations and infill development. 2017.7 Action MC-2.7-C: North Capitol Transportation Study Implement the recommendations of the North Capitol Street/ Truxton Circle Transportation Study. 2017.8 AREA ELEM ENTS COMPREHENSIVE PLAN DISTRICT ELEMENTS ADOPTED 12/19/06 P. 2-145 CHAPTER 21 NEAR NORTHWEST AREA ELEMENT [Note: the map facing Page 21-1 has been corrected to delete the label for “Foxhall Village” and to move the label for Burleith/ Hillandale to the left, to correct location.] Overview 2100 The Near Northwest Planning Area encompasses the 3.9 square miles located directly north and west of Central Washington. It extends from Glover Archbold Park on the west to North Capitol Street on the east. Its northern boundary is formed by Whitehaven Parkway west of Rock Creek, and by Connecticut Avenue, U Street, and Florida Avenue east of Rock Creek. The southern boundary is formed by the Potomac River, the Central Employment Area, and New York Avenue (east of 7th Street These boundaries are shown on the Map at left. Most of this area has historically been Council Ward 2, although in past and present times parts have also been included in Wards 1 and 5. 2100.1 Near Northwest is known for its historic architecture, well-established neighborhoods, lively shopping areas, and nationally recognized institutions. These features provide enduring reminders of the city’s 480 growth, from the 18th century to today’s international city. The Georgetown Historic District, established in 1950 in response to the demolition of large numbers of waterfront and canal-related historic buildings, was the first historic district established in city. Today, more then half of Near Northwest is included in historic districts; historic landmarks are designated throughout the area with concentrations in Georgetown, on Washington Circle, within the campus of George Washington University, in Dupont and Logan Circles, and along Massachusetts Avenue. These designations include some of the oldest residential and commercial buildings in the city. 2100.2 The development pattern is one of the most dense in the metropolitan region. Near Northwest neighborhoods contain some of the most diverse housing stock in the District, varying from single- family homes to high-rise apartments. Townhouses and mid-rise apartment buildings dating from the mid 19th to early 20th centuries define the area’s residential neighborhoods; these are most prominent in Georgetown, Burleith, Dupont Circle, Foggy Bottom, Logan Circle, Shaw, and Mount Vernon Square. Kalorama principally consists of single family homes dating to the early 20th century. Large apartment buildings – many built during the 1920s and 1930s – are concentrated along major roadways including Connecticut Avenue, New Hampshire Avenue, Massachusetts Avenue, Rhode Island Avenue, and 16th Street. More contemporary high-density construction defines the West End and the 14th Street corridor, as well as riverfront communities like the Watergate and Washington Harbour. 2100.3 The area is well connected to other part of the District and region by mass transit, including the Red, Green, Orange, and Blue subway lines and multiple bus lines. Several parkways, highways, and interstates also pass though or are immediately adjacent to the area. These include Interstate 66, the Whitehurst Freeway, Canal Road, Rock Creek and Potomac Parkway, and the I-395/Center Leg Freeway. The overall street pattern reflects the L’Enfant Plan, with prominent diagonal boulevards bisecting a rectangular grid. 2100.4 Shopping areas in Near Northwest range from regional destinations like M Street in Georgetown to neighborhood commercial districts like 17th Street in Dupont Circle. The more prominent retail areas are on the major streets and avenues like Connecticut Avenue, 14th Street, and 7th and 9th Streets. There are smaller retail districts throughout the area, and corner stores in almost every residential neighborhood. While there are a limited number of neighborhood parks, the entire Near Northwest area is within one and a half miles of Rock Creek Park or the National Mall. 2100.5 AREA ELEM ENTS COMPREHENSIVE PLAN DISTRICT ELEMENTS ADOPTED 12/19/06 P. 2-146 [Photo Caption: Near Northwest is known for its historic architecture, well-established neighborhoods, lively shopping areas, and nationally recognized institutions] Near Northwest is home to a number of institutions known both locally and nationally. Georgetown University, on a hill and somewhat removed from the activity of the city, has a number of Gothic buildings that establish an image of tradition. George Washington University, in Foggy Bottom at the edge of the Central Business District, is a much more urban campus. Museums and historic sites like the Phillips Collection, Woodrow Wilson House, and the Mary Mcleod Bethune Council House – attract visitors from the region and across the country. 14th Street is home to the Studio Theater as well as 481 other performing arts venues and galleries. Foreign embassies are concentrated along Massachusetts Avenue and in Dupont Circle and Kalorama. 2100.6 There are a number of local community and business associations that play an active role in shaping Near Northwest land use decisions. In addition to seven Advisory Neighborhood Commissions that represent residents from three Wards, there are many community associations and active groups with a specific focus. Some, like the Georgetown Partnership, work toward building a stronger business community. Others, like the Georgetown Citizens Association, the Foggy Bottom Association, the Logan Circle Community Association, and the Dupont Circle Conservancy have strong preservation programs. Others work directly with residents to create a higher quality of life. For instance, Shaw EcoVillage is training youth to be more effective leaders and catalysts for sustainable change in the District. 2100.7 This Planning Area has seen a modest increase in its population in recent years. The recent trend toward urban living occurring in cities across the United States has made this area increasingly desirable and has contributed to higher home costs. Increasing values in long sought-after neighborhoods like Georgetown, Kalorama, Foggy Bottom, West End, and Dupont Circle, has resulted in development activity moving east into Logan Circle, Shaw, and Mount Vernon Square. The strong real estate market has prompted many owners in these neighborhoods to renovate or sell their properties, leading to sharp increases in home prices and rents and a loss of affordable units. 2100.8 The most significant challenge facing the Near Northwest Planning Area is retaining the physical and social fabric of the community in the face of intense economic pressure. Parts of the area are still struggling to find the right balance between development and preservation. This struggle plays out in daily debates on physical planning issues like height, scale, and design, and on social issues relating to changing demographics and cultural values. Policies are needed to address a host of local issues; foremost among them are the preservation and production of affordable housing, strengthening opportunities for small and local businesses, and addressing the conflicts that inevitably result from the area’s highly diverse mix of land uses and densities. 2100.9 Context History 2101 Near Northwest includes the oldest inhabited areas of the District. Georgetown, formerly established in 1751 by the Maryland Assembly, was a tobacco port and independent municipality incorporated into the District of Columbia in 1800. At the time, the settlement was just outside the boundaries of the federal city. Construction of Georgetown University began in 1788, three years before Pierre L’Enfant’s Plan for the National Capital was prepared. 2101.1 AREA ELEM ENTS COMPREHENSIVE PLAN DISTRICT ELEMENTS ADOPTED 12/19/06 P. 2-147 [Photo caption: Near Northwest includes Georgetown, one of the oldest inhabited areas of the District] Prior to 1850, most of the area east of Georgetown was sparsely populated. Several businesses were located along the waterfront in Foggy Bottom at the mouth of the Chesapeake and Ohio Canal. Nearby, in the area just west of the White House, some of the first grand homes of the city were built. The Shaw and Mount Vernon Square neighborhoods also experienced modest residential development prior to 482 the Civil War and were known as “Northern Liberties.” 2101.2 The increase in population resulting from the Civil War facilitated residential development in Foggy Bottom, Shaw, and Mount Vernon Square. By the mid- to late-19th century, these areas were home to a mix of professional and working class residents. A number of “alley dwellings” were built in these areas, often housing the city’s poorest residents. 2101.3 The residential neighborhoods of Logan Circle, Dupont Circle, and Kalorama did not see significant development until the late-19th century. After the Civil War, Logan Circle became one of the most fashionable addresses in Washington. The rowhouses in this area and along 14th Street were more substantial than those built before the Civil War. Small apartment buildings began to appear in the area as the population increased and building sites became more limited. The Dupont Circle area followed a similar trend, as Massachusetts Avenue and its intersections at Dupont and Sheridan Circles created sites ideal for large, stand alone residences. Between 1870 and 1900, the avenue became the center of Washington’s “high society.” Kalorama, meanwhile, began to develop with townhomes and grand apartments, followed in the 1920s by large single family homes. 2101.4 By the late 19th century, horse-powered vehicles were replaced with independent street car routes that quickly became lined with commercial businesses. One line reinforced Wisconsin Avenue and M Street in Georgetown as a center of commercial activity, but residential districts on Connecticut Avenue and 14th Street were transformed – the former into an exclusive shopping district and the latter as a center for automobile sales and maintenance. Street car lines on 7th and 11th Streets also attracted commercial businesses that served residents living in nearby areas, as well as those heading home to areas further north. 2101.5 The ethnicity of residents living in Near Northwest has always been diverse. Until the 1930s, about onethird of Georgetown’s population was African American. An active, free African-American population also lived in the Dupont Circle area prior to the Civil War, leading some of the city’s earliest African- American education initiatives. During the mid-20th century, parts of Logan Circle and the Strivers Section of Dupont Circle were home to prominent African Americans, and the Shaw neighborhood became a vibrant center of African American culture. 2101.6 By the 1950s, the close-in residential neighborhoods of this area were considered to be less desirable than the outlying suburbs, and many residents moved or redeveloped their properties. Some of the large homes in Dupont Circle were torn down to make way for commercial development or apartment buildings, and the Shaw School Urban Renewal Plan replaced many of the alley dwellings with modern housing projects. Working-class Georgetown evolved into one of the city’s most prestigious residential and business addresses. By the 1990s, industrial uses along the waterfront had been replaced by offices, shops, and upscale residences. Similarly, the growth of George Washington University in Foggy Bottom redefined much of that neighborhood. 2101.7 [PULLQUOTE: Working-class Georgetown evolved into one of the city’s most prestigious residential and business addresses. By the 1990s, industrial uses along the waterfront had been replaced by offices, shops, and upscale residences.] AREA ELEM ENTS 483 COMPREHENSIVE PLAN DISTRICT ELEMENTS ADOPTED 12/19/06 P. 2-148 Today, 13 historic districts protect the character of the area’s residential neighborhoods and campus plans guide further development of Georgetown and George Washington Universities. Commercial districts in Georgetown and Dupont Circle are home to boutiques, galleries, and local and national retailers. Fourteenth Street is emerging as a trendy restaurant, arts, and retail district with hundreds of new housing units added in recent years. The construction of the new convention center at Mount Vernon Square is prompting restoration, reinvestment and new construction in the Shaw and Mount Vernon Square neighborhoods. 2101.8 Land Use 2102 Land use statistics for Near Northwest appear in Figure 21.1. Near Northwest comprises about 2,446 acres, including 240 acres of water and about 2,260 acres of land. This represents about 6 percent of the city’s land area. 2102.1 [INSERT Figure 21.1: Land Use Composition in the Near Northwest 2102.6] [Pie Chart “slices” unchanged from July Draft] Relative to other parts of the District, Near Northwest has higher percentages of commercial and institutional land. However, street rights-of-way occupy more land than any other use in the Planning Area, representing about one-third of the total acreage. This is slightly higher than in other parts of the city, due to the prominent street grid and broad avenues of the L’Enfant plan. 2102.2 Residential uses occupy 26 percent of the total land area. Of the residential acreage, about 30 percent consists of mid-rise to high-rise apartments and about 55 percent consists of row houses. The remaining 15 percent consists of single family detached or semi-detached homes. High density housing is concentrated along the Connecticut Avenue, Massachusetts Avenue, and 16th Street corridors. 2102.3 Recreation and open space make up 16 percent of the area, slightly below the citywide average. Most of the open space is associated with Rock Creek Park and Roosevelt Island. Other significant open spaces include historic Dupont Circle, Logan Circle, and Washington Circle. There are three recreation centers – Georgetown, Stead in Dupont Circle, and Kennedy in Shaw – and other park areas with active recreation facilities including athletic fields, swimming pools, and ball courts. Small playgrounds and triangle parks are located in all parts of the area. 2102.4 Commercial and institutional uses represent a much larger share of the Planning Area than they do in the city as a whole. Collectively, they represent 21 percent of the Planning Area compared to 10 percent citywide. The most significant retail areas are along linear corridors such as Wisconsin Avenue and M Street, Connecticut Avenue, and 14th Street. Institutional uses, including Georgetown University and George Washington University, comprise 11 percent of the Planning Area. 2102.5 The Planning Area has virtually no industrial land, very little federal land other than its parks, and about 75 acres of local public facilities (primarily schools Only about 30 acres of the Planning Area consists of vacant, private land, and most of this land is committed to future development projects. 2102.7 Demographics 2103 Basic demographic data for Near Northwest is shown in Table 21.1. In 2000, the area had a population of 68,324, or about 12 percent of the city’s total. This is one of only a few Planning Areas where population increased during the 1990s – in fact, Near Northwest experienced a 3.8 percent increase in population 484 between 1990 and 2000 while the city as a whole experienced a six percent decrease. 2103.1 AREA ELEM ENTS COMPREHENSIVE PLAN DISTRICT ELEMENTS ADOPTED 12/19/06 P. 2-149 Since 1990, residents of Near Northwest are more likely to be single, childless, and transient than the population at large. The percentage of seniors and children in the Planning Area dropped between 1990 and 2000, and average household size declined from 1.76 in 1990 to 1.64 in 2005. This is the lowest average household size in the city. In some census tracts such as the West End, more than 70 percent of the households had only one person in 2000. 2103.2 Between 1990 and 2000, every ethnic group in the area saw small increases with the exception of African-Americans, whose population decreased by 21 percent. Today, about 23 percent of the Planning Area’s population is black and 63 percent is white. Asians and Pacific Islanders represent 7 percent of the population, which is triple the average for the city as a whole. About 10 percent of the Planning Area’s population is of Hispanic origin, which is about equal to the citywide average. Almost one in five of the area’s residents were born in another country, which is significantly higher than the citywide average. Only one-third of the area’s residents lived in the same house in 2000 as they did in 1995, while the citywide average is closer to one-half. 2103.3 [PULLQUOTE: Almost one in five of the area’s residents were born in another country, which is significantly higher than the citywide average. Only one-third of the area’s residents lived in the same house in 2000 as they did in 1995, while the citywide average is closer to one-half.] In 2000, almost 15 percent of the area’s residents lived in group quarters. Much of this population was associated with dormitories on or adjacent to the university campuses. Several dormitories were built between 2000 and 2005, and today an estimated 10,700 people in Near Northwest reside in group quarters. 2103.4 Housing Characteristics 2104 The 2000 Census reported that 78 percent of the housing units in Near Northwest were in multi-unit buildings, a majority of which contained 50 units or more. The percentage of housing units in large apartment buildings is double the citywide average. In 2000, only 3.1 percent of the area’s housing units were single family detached homes. Another 18 percent were rowhouses or townhomes. The number of housing units in the Planning Area increased by about 1,000 between 1990 and 2000, and another 2,000 units between 2000 and 2005. 2104.1 [Photo Caption: The 2000 Census reported that 78 percent of all housing units in Near Northwest were in multi-unit buildings] Near Northwest experienced a striking drop in the number of vacant units between 1990 and 2005. In 1990, 13 percent of the area’s housing units were vacant. That figure dropped to 8.4 percent in 2000 and is believed to be less than seven percent in 2005. Most of the vacant housing stock is located in the eastern side of the Planning Area in the Shaw neighborhood. 2104.2 The 2000 Census reported that 33 percent of housing units in the area were owner-occupied and 67 percent were renter-occupied. The percentage of renter-occupied units is much higher in the Planning Area than in the city as a whole. However, it has declined slightly from 1990 due to the conversion of apartments to condos and the development of new condominiums. 2104.3 AREA ELEM ENTS COMPREHENSIVE PLAN DISTRICT ELEMENTS ADOPTED 12/19/06 P. 2-150 Table 21.1: Near Northwest at a Glance 2103.5 Basic Statistics Land Area (square miles—excl. water) 3.6 485 Population 1990 65,820 2000 68,324 2005 (estimated 71,700 2025 (projected 82,000 Households (2005 37,100 Household Population (2005 exclu des grou p qu arters 61,000 Persons Per Household (2005 1.64 Jobs (2005 89,400 Density (persons per sq mile 2005 19,900 Year 2000 Census Data Profile Near Northwest Planning Area Citywide Total of Total of Total Age Under 18 5,975 8.7 20.0 18-65 56,448 82.7 67.8 Over 65 5,901 8.6 12.2 Residents Below Poverty Level 12,968 19.0 20.2 Racial Composition White 42,846 62.7 30.4 Black 15,880 23.2 60.3 Native American 380 0.6 0.3 Asian/ Pacific Islander 4,537 6.6 2.6 Other 2,491 3.6 2.8 Multi-Racial 2,190 3.2 5.2 Hispanic Origin 6,783 9.9 7.8 Foreign-Born Residents 13,499 19.8 12.8 Tenure Owner Households 11,641 33.5 40.7 Renter Households 23,100 66.5 59.3 Population 5+ yrs in same house in 2000 as in 1995 22,078 33.2 46.9 Housing Occupancy Occupied Units 34,741 91.6 90.4 Vacant Units 3,201 8.4 9.6 Housing by Unit Type 1-unit detached 1,179 3.1 13.1 1-unit attached 6,809 17.9 26.4 2-4 units 3,974 10.5 11.0 5-9 units 2,181 5.7 8.0 10-19 units 2,518 6.6 10.3 20-49 units 4,309 11.4 7.4 50+ units 16,960 44.7 23.3 Mobile/ other 12 &amp;gt;0.1 0.2 Figures noted with an asterisk are estimates developed by the Office of Planning and the Department of Employment Services based on a variety of data sources Total population of subcategories may not match 2000 Census totals due to sampling errors. AREA ELEM ENTS COMPREHENSIVE PLAN DISTRICT ELEMENTS ADOPTED 12/19/06 P. 2-151 Income and Employment 2105 The 2000 Census reported the area’s median income to be $48,852, which is six percent higher than the citywide median of $45,927. Despite this fact, nearly 20 percent of the area’s population was below the federal poverty line in 2000—about the same rate as in the District as a whole. The statistics are somewhat misleading, however, as the high poverty rate in some census tracts correlates to the large student population. 2105.1 The 2000 Census includes data on the commuting patterns of residents of Near Northwest, and those who lived elsewhere but commuted to jobs within this Planning Area. Approximately 77 percent of the area’s residents worked within the District of Columbia and 23 percent commuted to the suburbs. Of those who worked within the District, 52 percent commuted Downtown, 26 percent worked within the Near Northwest, and 22 percent worked elsewhere in the city. One of the great advantages of living in Near Northwest is the potential proximity to work. Nearly 40 percent of the area’s residents walked or bicycled to work in 2000, which far exceeded the citywide average. 2105.2 486 Data from the Department of Employment Services and the DC Office of Planning indicates that the Near Northwest has more jobs than any other planning area of the city except Central Washington. Major employers include universities and their affiliated hospitals. There were 89,400 jobs in 2005, or 12 percent of the city’s total. According to the census, about one-third of these jobs were filled by District residents 2105.3 Projections 2106 Based on land availability, planning policies, and regional growth trends, Near Northwest is projected to continue adding households, population, and jobs through 2025. The Planning Area is expected to grow from 37,100 households in 2005 to 43,200 households in 2025, with a 14 percent increase in population from 71,700 to 82,000. More than 1,000 units of housing are currently under construction in the Planning Area. 2106.1 [PULLQUOTE: The Planning Area is expected to grow from 37,100 households in 2005 to 43,200 households in 2025, with a 14 percent increase in population. More than 1,000 units of housing are currently under construction in the Planning Area.] Residential growth is expected to be concentrated on the eastern side of the Planning Area, particularly along corridors like 7th Street, 9th Street, 11th Street, and 14th Street. Existing zoning in these areas permits a level of development that exceeds what currently exists. Additional job growth is also expected to take place along these corridors, with the number of jobs anticipated to increase by 3,900 in the next 20 years. 2106.2 Planning and Development Priorities 2107 Comprehensive Plan workshops in Near Northwest during 2005-2006 provided an opportunity for residents to discuss both citywide and neighborhood planning issues. Advisory Neighborhood Commissions were briefed on the Comp Plan on several occasions, providing additional opportunities for input. There have also been other meetings in the community not directly connected to the Comprehensive Plan that focused on specific planning issues for different parts of the area. These include meetings relating to the Shaw/ Convention Center Small Area Plan, the Great Streets Initiative, campus plans for the local universities, and a variety of transportation, historic preservation, and economic development initiatives across the area. 2107.1 AREA ELEM ENTS COMPREHENSIVE PLAN DISTRICT ELEMENTS ADOPTED 12/19/06 P. 2-152 During these meetings the community delivered several key messages, summarized below: 2107.2 (a) Improved public safety, a strong economy, and rising confidence in the real estate market have fueled demand for housing across the area. Home prices in Shaw rose 30 percent between 2004 and 2005 alone. As a result, there is growing anxiety about the effects of gentrification, particularly east of 14th Street NW. On the one hand, the reduced number of abandoned units and extensive restoration of older homes are positive signs that should continue to be encouraged. On the other hand, renovation has led to increased rents and property tax assessments, along with the risk of displacement of elderly and lower income residents, many who have lived in the community for generations. Economic diversity must be protected, and programs to retain and add affordable housing are urgently needed b) Given the location of Near Northwest adjacent to Central Washington, the encroachment of 487 offices, hotels, and other commercial uses has been an issue for many years. During the 1950s and 1960s, much of Downtown’s expansion occurred in the area just south of Dupont Circle. Today, zoning regulations and historic districts limit commercial encroachment into Near Northwest neighborhoods. However, the conversion of housing to non-residential uses continues to be an issue. In Sheridan- Kalorama, there continue to be concerns about homes being turned into foreign chanceries, with attendant impacts on parking, upkeep, and security. Foggy Bottom residents remain apprehensive about the impacts of university expansion on housing and neighborhood character. In Dupont and Logan Circles, there are ongoing issues relating to the conversion of apartments to hotels, offices, and institutional uses. Concentration of community based residential facilities is an issue in Logan Circle and in Shaw c) Much of the attraction of Near Northwest lies in the beauty of its tree-lined streets, its urbane and historic architecture, and the proportions of its buildings and public spaces. Maintaining the quality and scale of development continues to be a top priority for the community. Residents expressed the opinion that new infill development should avoid creating monotonous or repetitive building designs, and strive for a mix of building types and scales. View obstruction, insensitive design, and street and alley closings were all raised as issues. In the Shaw Area and the Mount Vernon Square North Area, additional designation of historic landmarks and establishment of historic districts may be needed. At the same time, downzoning is needed in parts of Dupont and Logan Circles, particularly where blocks of historic row houses are zoned for high-density apartments. Zoning in such locations has not kept up with their historic designations. There have also been ongoing debates about the definition of “historic”, particularly as preservationists seek to recognize the “recent past.” [PULLQUOTE: Much of the attraction of Near Northwest lies in the beauty of its tree-lined streets, its urbane and historic architecture, and the proportions of its buildings and public spaces. Maintaining the quality and scale of development continues to be a top priority for the community.] (d) The process of creating, administering, and enforcing zoning regulations, including the granting of variances and zoning changes, needs to be refined and consistently applied. Several meeting participants singled out the granting of large numbers of “Special Exceptions” as an objectionable practice. Another issue raised was the excessive use of Planned Unit Developments (PUDs) and the resulting allowances for increased density. The community asked that future PUDs be rigorously reviewed and designed in a manner that minimizes their impacts on adjacent properties and provides ample community amenities. Other specific zoning issues identified included parking provisions and the regulation of institutional uses e) The area’s dense and historic development pattern results in many different uses adjacent to each other. This is part of what makes the area so vibrant and interesting, but it inevitably leads to land use conflicts. There are continuing concerns about the impact of commercial development on the ambience AREA ELEM ENTS COMPREHENSIVE PLAN DISTRICT ELEMENTS ADOPTED 12/19/06 P. 2-153 of shopping districts and residential streets in Georgetown and Dupont Circle. Public safety and crowd control remains an issue in these areas. Certain kinds of commercial activities, such as fast food restaurants and liquor-licensed establishments are a source of concern for neighbors. The proximity of commercial and residential uses also leads to issues like the regulation of deliveries, trash removal, and sidewalk cafes. ANCs in the area play a particularly important role in addressing and resolving these 488 issues. [Photo Caption: The area’s dense and historic development pattern results in many different uses adjacent to each other.] (f) In some respects, those who live and work in Near Northwest enjoy some of the best transportation service in the city. The area’s compact development pattern and proximity to Downtown encourages walking, biking, and transit use, and for many owning a car is a choice rather than a necessity. But the area’s location at the hub of the region’s transportation system also produces adverse impacts. Arterials such as Wisconsin, Massachusetts, Connecticut, and Pennsylvania Avenues and 16th Street carry high volumes of car and truck traffic into the central city from outlying District neighborhoods and from the suburbs, with accompanying noise, congestion, and safety hazards. The wide avenues are efficient for moving traffic, but the flow is complicated by the pattern of circles and squares. Moreover, the arterials move traffic in a radial direction in and out of downtown, but traveling from east to west across the area is difficult. Given this fact, long-range plans for the Whitehurst Freeway are a concern for many neighbors. Other transportation issues raised at Comp Plan meetings in Near Northwest include the need for better access between Georgetown and the Metrorail system, the need to control cut-through traffic on residential side streets, and the need for improved pedestrian and bicycle safety g) Parking continues to be an issue in almost all of the area’s residential neighborhoods, particularly near the commercial districts and around major employment centers. Georgetown, Foggy Bottom, Logan Circle, and Dupont Circle, are affected by evening visitors to restaurants and bars. Foggy Bottom and Georgetown are also affected by student parking from George Washington and Georgetown Universities and other employers and businesses in the area. Many of the area’s residences do not have off-street parking, leaving residents to compete with visitors and employees for a limited number of off-street spaces. Cars circling for parking contribute to traffic and congestion in the area. Measures such as residential permit parking and university shuttle services addresses the shortage to some degree, but additional programs are needed to reduce parking conflicts h) Near Northwest is underserved by recreational facilities and open space. Despite proximity to Rock Creek Park, the ratio of park acres per resident is among the lowest in the city. Most of the neighborhood parks in the area are small and have limited or aging facilities. An analysis of recreational needs performed as part of the 2006 Parks and Recreation Master Plan concluded that virtually all parts of Near Northwest were deficient in athletic fields and that the east side was deficient in swimming pools. The Foggy Bottom-West End area and Logan Circle were identified as needing new recreation centers. Given the shortage of parkland, it is not surprising that many participants in Comp Plan workshops also expressed concerns about the loss of private open space. Particular concerns included the construction of additions and new buildings on lawns, patios, and parking lots, leading one workshop participant to the conclusion that “every inch of the area was being paved over.” Creating new parks will be difficult given the built out character of the area. Looking forward, it will be imperative to retain and enhance existing parks, make better use of street rights-of-way as open space, provide better connections to the area’s large parks, and set aside ample open space within new development. Landscaping, tree planting, and rooftop 489 gardens should all be strongly encouraged. [PULLQUOTE: Near Northwest is underserved by recreational facilities and open space. Despite proximity to Rock Creek Park, the ratio of park acres per resident is among the lowest in the city.] AREA ELEM ENTS COMPREHENSIVE PLAN DISTRICT ELEMENTS ADOPTED 12/19/06 P. 2-154 (i) Retail conditions in Near Northwest are uneven. Neighborhoods on the east side of the planning area do not have adequate commercial and service establishments; 7th Street and 9th Street, for example, still contend with shuttered storefronts and abandoned buildings. Retail districts on the west side of the planning area appear prosperous, but face other challenges. The “funky” quality of some of the area’s streets is disappearing, as lower-cost stores and services are replaced by national chain stores. There are worries about the area becoming too homogenous—with some suggesting that Georgetown’s M Street has effectively become a suburban mall in an urban setting. The changes along 14th Street are welcomed by some, but create tension between the old and the new. Despite the vastly different physical conditions on the east and west sides of the Planning Area, small businesses across the entire area face the stress of rising rents. Residents from Burleith to Shaw are concerned about the loss of the neighborhood businesses that define the character of their local shopping streets j) Expansion of institutional uses and non-profit organizations is an issue both for the community and the institutions themselves. The issue was most often raised in connection with George Washington University (GWU but was also brought up more broadly with regard to the effects of institutional expansion on the city’s tax base, traffic, parking, the loss of housing, and neighborhood character. Many residents believe that additional regulation and enforcement is needed to monitor university growth. University representatives, on the other hand, note the constraints of operating within enrollment and employment caps, and point to the steps they have taken to protect adjacent areas from objectionable effects. In general, workshop participants emphasized the need to assess institutional impacts on a cumulative, rather than incremental, basis. Campus plans guide the growth of universities, but there is no comparable mechanism to guide the expansion of institutions such as the World Bank, the IMF, and the Red Cross. One approach that warrants further consideration is to allow universities to “build up” on their properties, reducing the need for additional land for expansion. Of course, this raises other concerns, such as building height and mass. Another approach is to promote the development of satellite campuses and facilities. Careful balancing is needed to make sure the interests of all parties are considered, and to reach solutions where all can benefit. [Photo Caption: Expansion of institutional uses and non-profit organizations is an issue both for the community and the institutions themselves.] Policies and Actions NNW-1.0 General Policies NNW-1.1 Guiding Growth and Neighborhood Conservation 2108 The following general policies and actions should guide growth and neighborhood conservation decisions in Near Northwest. These policies and actions should be considered in tandem with those in the citywide elements of the Comprehensive Plan. 2108.1 Policy NNW-1.1.1: Residential Neighborhoods Maintain and enhance the historic, architecturally distinctive mixed density character of Near 490 Northwest residential neighborhoods, including Burleith, Georgetown, Foggy Bottom, Dupont Circle, Sheridan- Kalorama, Logan Circle, Mount Vernon Square, and Shaw. Ensure that infill development within these areas is architecturally compatible with its surroundings and positively contributes to the identity and quality of each neighborhood. 2108.2 AREA ELEM ENTS COMPREHENSIVE PLAN DISTRICT ELEMENTS ADOPTED 12/19/06 P. 2-155 Policy NNW-1.1.2: Directing Growth Generally direct growth within the Near Northwest Planning Area to the eastern side of the Planning Area (Logan Circle and Shaw given the strong market demand and limited land available on the west side, and the need for reinvestment and renovation on the east side. 2108.3 Policy NNW-1.1.3: Enhancing Stable Commercial Areas Sustain and enhance the neighborhood, community, and regional shopping areas of Near Northwest, including M Street, P Street, Wisconsin Avenue, Connecticut Avenue, Florida Avenue, 18th Street NW, 17th Street NW, and 14th Street NW. Sustain these areas as diverse, unique, pedestrian-oriented shopping streets that meet the needs of area residents, workers, and visitors. 2108.4 [Photo Caption: Historic, mixed density land uses characterize many Near Northwest neighborhoods.] Policy NNW-1.1.4 Neighborhood Commercial Revitalization Improve the neighborhood shopping areas along 7th, 9th, and 11th Streets NW. The success of the established businesses on these streets should be strongly encouraged, and new businesses that provide needed goods and services to area residents should be attracted. 2108.5 Policy NNW-1.1.5: Over Concentration of Liquor-Licensed Establishments Discourage the excessive concentrations of liquor-licensed on local shopping streets, especially in the Georgetown and Dupont Circle areas. 2108.6 Policy NNW-1.1.6: Non-Profits and Private Service Organizations Work with private service organizations and non-profit organizations in the Near Northwest area to ensure that their locations and operations do not create objectionable impacts on neighboring properties. In particular, the development plans of Georgetown and George Washington Universities should avoid impacts likely to become objectionable to surrounding residential areas and should aspire to improve such areas through improved landscaping, better lighting, safer pedestrian connections, and enhanced community policing. 2108.7 Policy NNW-1.1.7: Loss of Housing Strongly discourage the demolition of viable housing or the conversion of occupied housing units to nonresidential uses such as medical offices, hotels, foreign missions, and institutions. Maintain zoning regulations that limit the encroachment of non-residential uses into Near Northwest neighborhoods, particularly around the new Convention Center, along the west side of Connecticut Avenue, and in Foggy Bottom. 2108.8 Policy NNW-1.1.8: Student Housing Support and promote efforts by the area’s universities to develop on-campus dormitories in order to reduce pressure on housing in nearby neighborhoods. 2108.9 Policy NNW-1.1.9: Affordable Housing Protect the existing stock of affordable housing in the Near Northwest Planning Area, particularly in the Shaw and Logan Circle neighborhoods. Sustain measures to avoid displacement, such as tax relief and rent control, and to encourage the production of new affordable housing throughout the community. 491 2108.10 [PULLQUOTE: Protect the existing stock of affordable housing in the Near Northwest Planning Area, particularly in the Shaw and Logan Circle neighborhoods.] AREA ELEM ENTS COMPREHENSIVE PLAN DISTRICT ELEMENTS ADOPTED 12/19/06 P. 2-156 Policy NNW-1.1.10: Parking Management Continue to develop and implement programs to improve parking management in the commercial districts along Wisconsin Avenue, M Street, Connecticut Avenue, P Street, 17th Street, 14th Street, 9th Street, and 7th Street. Innovative methods for providing additional parking such as expanding the residential permit parking program, and leasing parking spaces at public facilities to parking operators for evening and weekend use, should be explored. 2108.11 Policy NNW-1.1.11: Pedestrian and Bicycle Safety Improve safety for pedestrians and bicycles, and the security of parked bicycles, throughout the Near Northwest, especially in the Dupont Circle area. 2108.12 Policy NNW-1.1.12: Pedestrian Connections Improve pedestrian connections through Near Northwest, especially along M Street between Connecticut Avenue and Georgetown, between the Dupont/Logan Circle areas and Downtown, and along the waterfronts in the Georgetown and Foggy Bottom areas. Create a continuous tree canopy along the area’s streets to create more comfortable conditions for pedestrians and bicyclists. 2108.13 Policy NNW-1.1.13: Managing Transportation Demand Strongly support buses, private shuttles, and other transit solutions that address travel needs within the Near Northwest area, including connections between Metrorail and the universities and the Georgetown commercial district, and connections between the Connecticut Avenue and Embassy Row hotels and the National Mall and downtown areas. Also, promote the formation of Transportation Management Associations to assist hotel operators, employers, and large apartment managers with efforts to promote transit use and alternatives to car ownership. 2108.14 Policy NNW-1.1.14: Transit to Georgetown Connect Georgetown to the regional Metrorail system via light rail/ streetcar or bus rapid transit, consistent with WMATA’s long-range plans. 2108.15 Action NNW-1.1-A: Retail Strategies for Foggy Bottom and Shaw Complete market studies of West End/Foggy Bottom and the area between New Jersey Avenue and North Capitol Street to assess unmet retail market demand, evaluate strategies for retaining local retailers, identify potential locations for new neighborhood serving retail, and develop strategies for attracting the appropriate mix of retail to each area. 2108.16 Action NNW-1.1-B: Alcoholic Beverage Control Laws Analyze the patterns of alcohol beverage control (ABC) licensed establishments in the Near Northwest area, and the regulations and procedures that guide the siting and operation of these establishments. Identify possible changes to improve enforcement of ABC regulations and to reduce the problems associated with high concentrations of bars and night clubs in the area’s commercial districts. 2108.17 Action NNW-1.1-C: Expanding Mass Transit Alleviate parking and traffic congestion in neighborhoods by providing a dedicated lane for mass transit on K Street. The feasibility of expanding service on the DC Circulator bus to connect Mount Vernon Square to Foggy Bottom, West End, and Georgetown also should be explored. 2108.18 492 [Photo Caption: Georgetown Commercial area] AREA ELEM ENTS COMPREHENSIVE PLAN DISTRICT ELEMENTS ADOPTED 12/19/06 P. 2-157 NNW-1.2 Conserving and Enhancing Community Resources 2109 Policy NNW-1.2.1: Scenic Resource Protection Protect and enhance the scenic visual resources of the Near Northwest Planning Area, including the Potomac Waterfront, Rock Creek Park, the park circles of the L’Enfant Plan, and the historic architecture and streetscapes that define the area’s commercial and residential areas. 2109.1 See the Urban Design Element for policies on preserving and enhancing architectural character. Policy NNW-1.2.2: Heritage Tourism Promote the lesser-known cultural resources of Near Northwest neighborhoods, such as theaters, galleries, historic home museums, historic districts and landmarks, and colleges and universities. Encourage heritage trails, walking tours, historic markers, and other measures that create a greater awareness of these resources. 2109.2 Policy NNW-1.2.3: Noise Reduction Continue efforts to reduce noise in Georgetown and Foggy Bottom associated with air traffic in and out of Washington-Reagan National Airport. 2109.3 Policy NNW-1.2.4: Job Linkages Capitalize on the presence of hotels and universities within the Planning Area to create additional job opportunities for residents of Near Northwest and other parts of the District of Columbia. Encourage partnerships with the area’s institutional and hospitality sector employers that help residents from across the city obtain a job and move up the employment ladder. 2109.4 Policy NNW-1.2.5: Park Partnerships Encourage partnerships between the Department of Recreation and Parks and the National Park Service so that federal parkland, particularly Rock Creek Park and the L’Enfant park reservations, can better serve Near Northwest residents. Such partnerships are particularly important given the shortage of athletic fields and other recreational facilities within Near Northwest, and the limited land available for new recreational facilities. 2109.5 [Photo Caption: Logan Circle] Policy NNW-1.2.6: Increasing Park Use and Acreage Identity opportunities for new pocket parks, plazas, and public spaces within the Near Northwest Planning Area, as well as opportunities to expand and take full advantage of existing parks. 2109.6 Policy NNW-1.2.7: Shoreline Access Continue efforts to improve linear access along the Potomac River shoreline, and to improve access between the shoreline and adjacent neighborhoods such as Georgetown and Foggy Bottom. 2109.7 Policy NNW-1.2.8: Arts Districts Encourage existing and new arts activities along 7th Street and 14th Street, in an effort to link these corridors to the arts district along the U Street corridor in the adjacent Mid-City Planning Area. Theaters, galleries, studios, and other arts and cultural facilities and activities should be encouraged on these streets, with steps take to reduce parking, traffic, and other impacts on the Shaw and Logan Circle communities. 2109.8 Policy NNW-1.2.9: Design Review Use the Historic Preservation design review process to promote superior architecture and urban design in Near Northwest’s designated historic districts, including Georgetown, Sheridan-Kalorama, Strivers AREA ELEM ENTS COMPREHENSIVE PLAN DISTRICT ELEMENTS ADOPTED 12/19/06 P. 2-158 Section, Dupont Circle, Foggy Bottom, Massachusetts Avenue, Mount Vernon Square, Greater 14th Street, Logan Circle, Blagden Alley, and Shaw. 2109.9 Policy NNW-1.2.10: Sustainable Development 493 Encourage the use of green building practices within Near Northwest, with a particular emphasis on green roofs. Rooftop gardens should be encouraged in new construction and major rehabilitation projects as a way to create additional green space, reduce stormwater runoff, and provide an amenity for residents. 2109.10 Action NNW-1.2-A: Streetscape Plans Design and implement streetscape plans for a) Connecticut Avenue between Dupont Circle and the Taft Bridge b) P Street between Dupont Circle and Rock Creek Park c) M Street between Connecticut Avenue and Georgetown d) 17th Street between Massachusetts Avenue and New Hampshire Avenue e) 14th Street between Thomas Circle and U Street; and (f) 7th Street and 9th Streets between Mount Vernon Square and U Street. 2109.11 Action NNW-1.2-B: Recreational Facilities Develop additional recreational centers within the Planning Area, with a priority on the Logan Circle and Foggy Bottom-West End areas. The 2006 Parks and Recreation Master Plan identified these areas as being the parts of Near Northwest that are most deficient in recreational centers. 2109.12 [PULLQUOTE: Develop additional recreational centers within the Planning Area, with a priority on the Logan Circle and Foggy Bottom-West End areas.] Action NNW-1.2.C: Historic Surveys Conduct additional historic surveys within the Near Northwest, and consider additional areas for historic district designation, specifically in areas east of 7th Street NW. 2109.13 NNW-2.0 Policy Focus Areas 2110 The Comprehensive Plan has identified five areas in Near Northwest as “policy focus areas”, indicating that they require a level of direction and guidance above that in the prior section of this Area Element and in the citywide elements (see Map 21.1 and Table 21.2 These areas are: Shaw/ Convention Center Area Dupont Circle 14th Street/Logan Circle Georgetown Waterfront Foggy Bottom/ West End 2110.1 [INSERT Map 21.1: Near Northwest Policy Focus Areas 2110.2.

This area has a long history as an economically and ethnically diverse residential neighborhood. An urban renewal plan for the area was adopted in 1969 in response to the 1968 riots and poor housing conditions in much of the area. The urban renewal plan took a more incremental approach than was taken in Southwest, selectively clearing alley dwellings and substandard housing rather than calling for wholesale clearance. As a result, the area contains a mix of publicly assisted housing complexes from the 1970s and older row houses from the late 19th and early 20th centuries. 2111.1 AREA ELEM ENTS COMPREHENSIVE PLAN DISTRICT ELEMENTS ADOPTED 12/19/06 P. 2-160 Recent market trends in the District, as well as the opening of the Washington Convention Center in 2004, have increased development pressure on the neighborhood. This has brought the opportunity to revitalize the struggling business districts along 7th, 9th, and 11th Streets, but it has also brought the threat of displacement for long-time low-income residents. Two historic districts were created in the area in 1999 to control growth and mitigate the effects of development sparked by the new convention center in the center of this neighborhood. 2111.2 In 2005, the Office of Planning completed the Convention Center Area Strategic Development Plan to guide development, revitalization, and conservation in this area. The Plan identified several issues, including the need to protect affordable housing, generate new quality housing, revitalize local businesses, improve sidewalks and public space, upgrade parks and public facilities, provide stronger design controls, and expand the Shaw Historic District. Nearly one-fifth of the housing units in the study area receive some form of public subsidy and are considered affordable. Many are part of the federal Section 8 program and are vulnerable to conversion to market rate rents in the next five to ten years. A recent market study of the area indicates that residents can support up to 600,000 square feet of commercial space, but until 2005 there was no strategy for where it should be located or how it might be attracted. 2111.3 [PULLQUOTE: The Convention Center Area Strategic Development Plan identified several issues, including the need to protect affordable housing, generate new quality housing, revitalize local businesses, and improve sidewalks and public space.] The Strategic Development Plan identifies programs to address these issues and defines specific actions and municipal programs to preserve and enhance the quality of life for all residents living in the study area. It defines a number of sub-areas, including historic row house neighborhoods, the immediate vicinity of the Convention Center area, the 7th/9th retail corridors, the Uptown Area (in the adjacent Mid- City Planning Area the 11th Street corridor, Shaw and Seaton Schools, the Rhode Island Av/ New 495 Jersey Av intersection, the Bundy School/ NW Cooperative II, and the two metro station areas. The Plan calls for maintaining the current number of affordable housing units, targeting commercial development to sites where it is most likely to benefit the community, and providing a clear hierarchy of streets and public spaces. 2111.4 Policy NNW-2.1.1: Affordable Housing Protect existing affordable housing within the Shaw/ Convention Center area, and produce new affordable housing and market rate housing on underutilized sites. Use a range of tools to retain and develop affordable housing in the study area, including tenant organization and public education, inclusionary zoning, renewing project-based Section 8 contracts, tax abatements, public-private partnerships, and including affordable housing when development on publicly owned land includes a residential component. 2111.5 Policy NNW-2.1.2: Reinforce Existing Development Patterns Stabilize and maintain existing moderate-density row house areas within the Shaw/ Convention Center Area. Locate multi-unit buildings in areas already zoned for greater density, including areas near the Mount Vernon Square and Shaw/Howard University Metrorail stations, and on publicly owned land with the potential for housing. Ensure that development on infill sites scattered throughout the row house portions of the Shaw/ Convention Center area is consistent with the neighborhood’s character. 2111.6 Policy NNW-2.1.3: Shaw/ Howard University and Mount Vernon Square Metro Stations Encourage mixed-income residential development with underground parking adjacent to the Shaw/Howard and Mount Vernon Square Metro stations, particularly on existing surface parking lots. 2111.7 AREA ELEM ENTS COMPREHENSIVE PLAN DISTRICT ELEMENTS ADOPTED 12/19/06 P. 2-161 Policy NNW-2.1.4: Blagden Alley Encourage adaptive reuse and mixed use infill development along Blagden Alley, a residentially zoned block with historic structures such as carriage houses, garages, and warehouses. Appropriate measures should be taken to safeguard existing residential uses as such development takes place. 2111.8 Policy NNW-2.1.5: 7th and 9th Street Corridors Locate retail development within the Shaw/ Convention Center Area in a manner that best serves residents, creates the best environment for businesses to succeed, and uses land already zoned for commercial uses. Continuous ground floor retail uses should be encouraged along sections of 7th and 9th Streets as designated in the 2005 Strategic Development Plan to create a traditional pedestrian- oriented Main Street pattern and establish a unified identity for the community. These corridors should attract convention-goers, residents, and visitors, and should include both new and existing businesses. 2111.9 [PULLQUOTE: Locate retail development within the Shaw/ Convention Center Area in a manner that best serves residents, creates the best environment for businesses to succeed, and uses land already zoned for commercial uses.] Policy NNW-2.1.6: 11th Street Retail Strengthen 11th Street between M and O Streets as a mixed use district with ground floor retail and upper story residential buildings with a mix of market rate and affordable units. Emphasize 11th and N Streets as the hub of this area. 2111.10 496 Policy NNW-2.1.7: Public Realm Improve streets and open spaces throughout the Shaw/Convention Center Area. Open space in the area should promote a sense of community, provide a high level of public safety, and address multiple needs. Connections between the area’s parks and open spaces should be strengthened and opportunities for new recreational activities should be accommodated where feasible. 2111.11 Policy NNW-2.1.8: Street Hierarchy Design the streetscapes in the Shaw/ Convention Center Area to clearly differentiate between residential streets and commercial streets, and to highlight the distinct role of avenues, retail streets, greenways, and primary and secondary residential streets. 2111.12 Action NN-2.1-A: Historic Resources Establish an historic district in Shaw East Survey Area.

Seaton School should be included within the study area. 2111.24 NNW-2.2 Dupont Circle 2112 The general pattern of land use in Dupont Circle is well established. Future development in the area is limited by the area’s designation as an historic district and the application of the Dupont Circle zoning overlay. The area is an attractive residential neighborhood due to its proximity to Downtown, restaurants and shopping, pedestrian-friendly streets, historic architecture, and diverse housing stock. Commercial and residential infill development and renovation are anticipated to continue, creating continued concerns about the displacement of local services by national chains and region-serving retail uses, as well as the impacts of commercial uses on parking, public safety, noise, and quality of life. 2112.1 [PULLQUOTE: Future development in the Dupont Circle area is limited by the area’s designation as an historic district and the application of the Dupont Circle zoning overlay. The area is an attractive residential neighborhood due to its proximity to Downtown, restaurants and shopping, pedestrianfriendly streets, historic architecture, and diverse housing stock.] 498 Pedestrian connections between Dupont Circle and adjacent neighborhoods could be stronger than they are today. This is particularly true along P Street west of the Circle, which is an important link to Rock Creek Park and Georgetown. A streetscape plan for the corridor has been prepared but has yet to be implemented. Similarly, 17th Street between P Street and R Street could benefit from streetscape improvements, landscaping, updated street furniture, and other enhancements that create a more attractive public space. 2112.2 Policy NNW-2.2.1: Maintaining Dupont Circle’s Residential Character Maintain the Dupont Circle neighborhood as a primarily residential area and discourage the expansion of commercial uses into currently residential areas. For the purposes of this policy, Dupont Circle shall be defined as the area generally bounded by Rock Creek Park on the west, 15th Street NW on the east, Massachusetts Avenue (east of Connecticut Avenue NW) and N Street (west of Connecticut Avenue) on the south, and Florida Avenue and U Street on the north. This area is shown on the Map at the beginning of this chapter. 2112.3 [Photo Caption: Dupont Circle row houses] Policy NNW-2.2.2: Dupont Circle Area Policies Use the following standards in evaluating new buildings and alterations in the Dupont Circle area a) Require a scale of development consistent with the nature and character of the Dupont Circle area in height and bulk b) Ensure a general compatibility in the scale of new buildings with older low-scale buildings by restricting the maximum permitted height and floor area ratio of the new buildings to that of the underlying zone; AREA ELEM ENTS COMPREHENSIVE PLAN DISTRICT ELEMENTS ADOPTED 12/19/06 P. 2-164 (c) Preclude demolitions or partial demolitions that would lead to an increase in height and floor area ratio inappropriate to the area d) Enhance the residential character of the area by maintaining existing residential uses and controlling the scale, location, and density of commercial and residential development; and (e) Ensure compatibility of development with the Comprehensive Plan. 2112.4 Policy NNW-2.2.3: Q Street Plaza Maintain the Dupont Circle Q Street Metrorail entrance as a civic plaza that is compatible with the adjacent mixed use neighborhood. Encourage the restoration of storefronts as active retail uses along Connecticut Avenue from Q Street to the Circle. 2112.5 Actions NNW-2.2-A: 17th Street Design Plan Revise and implement the 17th Street NW Design Plan. The Plan calls for streetscape improvements to the entire right-of-way on both sides of the street between P and S Streets and the adjoining, contiguous commercial areas of R, Corcoran, Q, Church, and P Streets, NW. The plan was prepared several years ago and should be updated before it is implemented. 2112.6 Action NNW-2.2-B: P Street Improvements Implement the recommendations of the P Street streetscape study, which calls for improvements to sidewalks, planting strips, vacant sites, and off-street parking. 2112.7 Action NNW-2.2-C: Dupont Circle Overlay Expansion Consider expansion of the Dupont Circle overlay to include the 18th Street commercial area (between S and U Streets) and the south side of U Street between 14th and 18th Street. 2112.8 See the Central Washington Element (p. 16-XX) for a discussion of the Lower 16th Street Area NNW-2.3 14th Street/Logan Circle 2113 The 14th Street corridor extending from Massachusetts Avenue north to S Street, and adjacent area between 12th Street and 15th Street NW, includes a wide range of residential development, from 499 large historical mansions and rowhouses to high-rise apartment buildings. The southern part of this area along Massachusetts Avenue is one of the most densely developed areas in the city. Low-rise and garden apartments, including subsidized housing, also have been built within this area. The Logan Circle neighborhood also includes numerous churches. The area’s only significant parks and open spaces are Logan Circle, owned and maintained by the National Park Service, and playing fields at Garrison Elementary School. 2113.1 Major building renovation has been taking place in the Logan Circle area for more than a decade. The development of a Whole Foods (Fresh Fields) supermarket on P Street just west of 14th Street in 2001 was a catalyst for revitalization, sparking additional commercial development on P Street as well as the development of many large-scale residential projects in the vicinity. Other catalytic projects, like the new Studio and Woolly Mammoth Theaters, have been helped transform 14th Street from its former life as the city’s “auto row” into a lively arts, restaurant, and loft district. An Arts Overlay zone district along 14th Street includes incentives for arts-oriented businesses on the corridor. 2113.2 Current trends in Logan Circle are expected to continue into the future, with 14th Street emerging as an even stronger center for arts and entertainment over the next decade. Additional restaurants, theaters, lofts, and apartments are encouraged on the blocks between Thomas Circle and U Street, creating a dynamic street environment that epitomizes the best qualities of urban living. Development on the AREA ELEM ENTS COMPREHENSIVE PLAN DISTRICT ELEMENTS ADOPTED 12/19/06 P. 2-165 corridor should be designed to minimize impacts on adjacent residential areas, adaptively reuse important historic structures, and preserve long-time neighborhood institutions like churches. 2113.3 [Photo Caption: 14th Street is emerging as a pedestrian-oriented shopping street] Policy NNW-2.3.1: 14th Street Arts District Promote and encourage the presence of the arts along 14th Street between M Street and Florida Avenue, and preserve and protect the area’s entertainment, arts, and architectural history. 2113.4 Policy NNW-2.3.2: 14th Street Mixed Use Promote the development of art galleries, lofts, and business incubators for the arts along 14th Street, along with the establishment of cultural facilities and street level retail and neighborhood service uses, such as restaurants and local-serving professional offices. 2113.5 Policy NNW-2.3.3: Public Realm Address public safety, urban design, and public space issues along 14th Street to foster a safe, attractive environment conducive to the arts and arts-related businesses. 2113.6 Policy NNW-2.3.4: Lot Consolidation Encourage lot consolidation to address the many narrow commercial sites that exist along 14th Street to encourage suitable scale and massing and improve conditions for new development along the corridor. 2113.7 Policy NNW-2.3.5: Arts Funding Encourage the creation and funding of programs that promote arts activities along 14th Street, such as the “Design DC 14th Street Corridor Project” sponsored by the Commission for the Arts and Humanities, and that assist in the development of new arts facilities. 2113.8 500 Action NNW-2.3-A: Urban Design Study Undertake an urban design study and pursue funding to improve public space along 14th Street, including signage, tree planting and landscaping, special treatment of bus stops, public art, lighting, and street furniture that uniquely identifies the thoroughfare as an arts district. 2113.9 Action NNW-2.3-B: 14th Street Parking Study Complete a parking study for the 14th Street corridor and adjacent side streets assessing options for meeting the parking needs of local theaters, churches, restaurants, businesses, and residents. Proposals for shared parking and restriping spaces (from parallel to diagonal) should be explored as part of this study. Any parking changes should ensure that additional parking spaces are managed efficiently, that pedestrian and bicycle safety and movement are ensured. 2113.10 NNW-2.4 Georgetown Waterfront 2114 At one time, the Foggy Bottom and Georgetown waterfronts included industrial uses such as gas works, glass companies, breweries, and warehouses. Most of these buildings were removed long ago to make way for office, retail, parks, and residential development. Some have been adapted for contemporary mixed use development. The waterfront has emerged as a major activity center, with new parkland west of the Washington Harbour complex. 2114.1 The extension of the waterfront park from Washington Harbour to the Key Bridge remains a high priority. When the proposed 10-acre waterfront park is completed, the goal of closing the one remaining gap in an AREA ELEM ENTS COMPREHENSIVE PLAN DISTRICT ELEMENTS ADOPTED 12/19/06 P. 2-166 otherwise continuous park extending from Hains Point to the District of Columbia line will be achieved. 2114.2 [PULLQUOTE: The extension of the waterfront park from Washington Harbour to the Key Bridge remains a high priority. When the proposed 10-acre waterfront park is completed, the goal of closing the one remaining gap in an otherwise continuous park extending from Hains Point to the District of Columbia line will be achieved.] An extension of the park from Thompson Boathouse to the Kennedy Center also is planned, with separate paths for pedestrians and bicyclists along the water’s edge. There are also plans to develop additional non-motorized boating facilities to supplement the Thompson Boathouse. At the present time, there is considerable unmet demand for boating and fishing facilities along this stretch of the waterfront. 2114.3 Policy NNW-2.4.1: Georgetown Waterfront Provide a continuous linear park connection along the Potomac River waterfront in Georgetown and Foggy Bottom, including paths for pedestrians and bicyclists, fountains, seating areas, landscaping and open space, lighting, public access to the water, new non-motorized boating facilities, and fishing areas. 2114.4 Policy NNW-2.4.2: Erosion and Bank Stabilization Work with the National Park Service to stabilize the Potomac River Banks, clean tidal flat areas, and reduce erosion along the Potomac shoreline and along Rock Creek. 2114.5 Action NNW-2.4-A: Waterfront Park Improvements Complete the waterfront park and promenade west of Washington Harbour, including an extension of the bicycle and pedestrian path and parkway from the Thompson Boat House to the Kennedy Center. 501 2114.6 [Photo Caption: C&amp;amp;O Canal towpath in Georgetown] NNW-2.5 Foggy Bottom/ West End 2115 Foggy Bottom is one of the District’s oldest residential neighborhoods. It includes a mix of 19th century alley houses, small-scale townhouses, mid rise apartments and condominiums, as well as the campus of George Washington University and GWU Hospital. Major federal uses, including the Department of State and the Kennedy Center, are located in the neighborhood. The neighborhood also includes Columbia Plaza and the Watergate, both mixed use complexes that are predominantly residential. There are also several hotels and office buildings in the area. 2115.1 The neighborhood has a shortage of usable parkland. The Potomac Freeway along the area’s western boundary restricts access between the neighborhood, adjacent parkland, the waterfront, and the Kennedy Center. George Washington Circle provides a large centrally located open space, but vehicular traffic around the circle makes it difficult to access. Rock Creek Park itself is cut off from the area by the freeway; moreover, there are inconsistencies between the Comprehensive Plan and zoning in the area, with the Comp Plan designating the public lands as parks and open space while zoning suggests highdensity residential development. Open, green space is the preferred use where such conflicts exist (see Policy 2.5.4 below 2115.2 The heart of the neighborhood, including the major concentration of 19th century townhouses, was designated a historic district in 1986. In 1992, the Foggy Bottom Overlay District was created to provide further protection to the area, and to maintain the residential development pattern. 2115.3 AREA ELEM ENTS COMPREHENSIVE PLAN DISTRICT ELEMENTS ADOPTED 12/19/06 P. 2-167 The West End, just north of Foggy Bottom, is a former industrial and residential area that has been undergoing major change since the late 1970s. The area was rezoned in 1975 to encourage mixed use development. Since that time there has been major office, hotel and residential development, and very few vacant sites remain. The opportunity remains to enhance the M Street corridor between Georgetown and Connecticut Avenue, and to strengthen Pennsylvania Avenue corridor, which currently defines the edge between Foggy Bottom and the West End. 2115.4 The expansion of George Washington University has been an ongoing issue of significant concern in Foggy Bottom and the West End, with neighbors expressing great concerns about the loss of housing stock and the changing character of the community. Continued commercial, hotel, and institutional expansion—coupled with increased regional commuter traffic—has caused major traffic and parking problems and concerns about air quality and disruption of the quality of life. The objectives for land use decisions in the Foggy Bottom/ West End area are to conserve and enhance the existing residential neighborhood, maintain and improve existing parkland, and balance the needs of local residents with the needs of the university to carry out its academic mission. Efforts should continue to retain the residential balance of the area, ensure adherence to the Campus Plan, and proactively address neighborhood and university concerns. 2115.5 The area includes the Foggy Bottom/ GWU Metro Station, one of the busiest in the system. This station has only one entrance and elevator. A second entrance would be desirable and is encouraged in the future. 2115.6 [Photo Caption: Multi-family housing the District’s West End] Policy NNW-2.5.1: GWU/ Foggy Bottom Coordination Encourage continued efforts to improve communication and coordination between George 502 Washington University (GWU) and the Foggy Bottom and West End communities. Campus Plans for the university must demonstrate how the campus can manage its academic mission within its current boundaries and enrollment. These efforts must ensure protection of the residential character of Foggy Bottom. 2115.7 Policy NNW-2.5.2: Student Housing and Parking Issues Support efforts by George Washington University to place students in residential facilities within the campus boundaries or at the Mount Vernon campus to alleviate pressure on the housing stock in Foggy Bottom/ West End and to develop transportation demand management programs and facilities that reduce parking problems on residential streets in the campus area. 2115.8 Policy NNW-2.5.3: GWU Building Intensity Consider in principle the concept of increasing density on the existing George Washington University campus for future space and facility needs (as measured by the enrollment, staff, and faculty limits set in the approved Campus Plan) provided that steps are taken to avoid sharp contrasts in height and bulk between the campus and the surrounding community, and to mitigate the effects of increased traffic, parking, and other impacts. 2115.9 Policy NNW-2.5.4: West End/ Foggy Bottom Parkland Protect and maximize the benefits of, all parks and open spaces in this area, including George Washington Circle, Juarez Circle and adjacent open space “islands,” Rock Creek Park, and Rock Creek and Potomac Parkway. The publicly-owned land between M Street and Virginia Avenue and 26th and 29th Street, which includes both federally-owned and District-owned land, shall be retained as parkland and shall not be used for development or highways.2115.10 [Photo Caption: Foggy Bottom] AREA ELEM ENTS COMPREHENSIVE PLAN DISTRICT ELEMENTS ADOPTED 12/19/06 P. 2-168 Action NNW-2.5-A: Foggy Bottom/ West End Transportation Improvements Conduct studies and implement appropriate changes to improve access and circulation between, through, and around the Foggy Bottom and West End neighborhoods, respecting the L’Enfant Plan street grid, protecting Juarez Circle and other parklands as open space, and better incorporating the transportation needs of various institutions and uses into the fabric of surrounding neighborhoods. 2115.11 Action NNW-2.5-B: Washington Circle Design and implement pedestrian access improvements to the Washington Circle open space. 2115.12 Action NNW-2.5-C: Zoning/ Comp Plan Conflicts on Open Space Apply the proposed “Open Space” zoning designation (see Action PROS-1.3-A) to the publicly- owned properties north and south of K Street between 29th Street and Rock Creek Park. 2115.13 Action NNW-2.5-D: Metro Station Access Support the development of an additional entry portal to the Foggy Bottom Metro station. 2115.14 AREA ELEM ENTS COMPREHENSIVE PLAN DISTRICT ELEMENTS ADOPTED 12/19/06 P. 2-169 CHAPTER 22 ROCK CREEK EAST AREA ELEMENT Overview 2200 The Rock Creek East Planning Area encompasses the 7.4 square miles located east of Rock Creek Park, north of Spring Road NW, and west of North Capitol Street and Riggs Road. It also includes the 503 Armed Forces Retirement Home and the Irving Street Hospital Center Complex. Its boundaries are shown in the Map at left. Most of this area has historically been Council Ward 4 although in past and present times, parts have been included in Ward 5. 2200.1 Rock Creek East is an attractive residential community containing many stable low and moderate density neighborhoods. Single family communities like North Portal Estates, Colonial Village, Crestwood, Crestwood North, Carter Barron East, Shepherd Park, 16th Street Heights, and Takoma are known for their park-like ambiance, sense of community, open spaces, and family atmosphere. Row house and semi-detached neighborhoods such as Lamond Riggs, Brightwood, Brightwood Park, Petworth, and Manor Park have similar positive qualities. The major planning objective throughout the community is to conserve these traits as the housing stock matures and infill development occurs. 2200.2 Georgia Avenue is the commercial heart of this Planning Area, with local shops that serve the adjacent neighborhoods. There are also small shopping districts in Takoma, near 14th Street and Colorado Avenue, along Kennedy Street, along Upshur near 3rd Street, and along 14th Street between Allison and Decatur Streets. Other major employment centers in the area include the Irving Street Hospital Complex, Walter Reed Army Medical Center, and the Armed Forces Retirement Home. The possible reuse of the latter two sites during the next 20 years presents planning challenges that must be addressed proactively so that the area’s well-established neighborhoods are protected and enhanced. 2200.3 Rock Creek East is served by two major transit hubs—the Takoma and Georgia Avenue/Petworth Metrorail stations. Residents also use transit stations in adjacent Planning Areas, including Columbia Heights, Van Ness/UDC, and Cleveland Park. Historically, the major circulation routes through the Planning area have been the north-south arterials leading out of Downtown, such as 16th Street, 14th Street, Georgia Avenue (7th Street New Hampshire Avenue, and North Capitol Street. East/west circulation is more limited. Missouri Avenue/ Military Road is the major east-west street and one of the few that connects the neighborhoods east of Rock Creek Park with those to the west. 2200.4 The community includes many important open spaces and natural resources, the most significant of which is Rock Creek Park itself. The park provides a massive buffer of green space, as well as opportunities for both passive and active recreation. It includes amenities such as a golf course, Carter Barron Amphitheater, and tennis facilities that host professional tennis players from across the United States. There are also a number of neighborhood parks, some serving the dual function of being school recreation areas. Recreation centers have recently been built in Brightwood, Lamond, and Takoma. The Fort Circle Parks also cross the area, providing a continuous linear green space from Rock Creek to Fort Totten and beyond. Rock Creek Cemetery, the oldest cemetery in the District of Columbia, is also located here. 2200.5 [PULLQUOTE: The community includes many important open spaces and natural resources, the most significant of which is Rock Creek Park itself. The park provides a massive buffer of green space, as well as opportunities for both passive and active recreation.] AREA ELEM ENTS COMPREHENSIVE PLAN DISTRICT ELEMENTS ADOPTED 12/19/06 P. 2-170 504 Rock Creek East has always had a strong sense of community spirit, due in part to a well organized network of community associations, churches, and interest groups. Organizations include neighborhood groups like the civic and citizens associations in Shepherd Park, Brightwood, South Manor Park, Crestwood, Lamond Riggs, Carter Barron East, and Takoma. “Georgia Avenue Day” has always been special event for residents and visitors alike. Farmers markets are hosted in Petworth, Takoma, and 14th Street Heights. 2200.6 While the area has enjoyed a relatively stable existence, the future holds a number of land use and community development challenges. Georgia Avenue continues to have high commercial vacancy rates, aesthetic issues, parking problems, and land use conflicts where commercial businesses abut low density housing. While attracting new businesses to the avenue is a high priority, helping existing businesses thrive is also important. In Takoma, there are issues related to the impacts of infill development around the Metro station. The CSX rail corridor in Manor Park and Lamond Riggs continues to support industrial land uses, sometimes without sufficient buffering for adjacent residential areas. As noted above, the future of Walter Reed Hospital continues to be debated, and portions of the Armed Forces Retirement Home may be developed in the coming years. These changes will impact traffic, parking, and the visual character of Rock Creek East neighborhoods. 2200.7 Rock Creek East also faces the challenge of retaining its economic and social diversity in the face of rising housing costs. Home prices in the Petworth/Brightwood/16th Street Heights zip code (20011) rose a staggering 35 percent between 2004 and 2005 alone, one of the sharpest increases in the city. Many apartments in areas like Brightwood and Brightwood Park have been converted to condominiums. The increase in housing costs has made the area much less affordable for Rock Creek East’s working families and for its large population of low and moderate income seniors. On the other hand, demographic changes are making the area more ethnically diverse than it used to be. The area’s Hispanic population more than doubled between 1990 and 2000. 2200.8 Looking to the future, neighborhoods from Crestwood to Takoma share the goal of keeping Rock Creek East a stable, healthy, and attractive community. Residents seek to retain the residential character, appearance, and historical continuity of their neighborhoods. Sustaining these qualities will require that development is carefully and strategically directed, and that additional steps are taken to conserve neighborhoods, enhance environmental quality, provide an effective transportation network, improve health care and educational services, reduce crime, upgrade public facilities and infrastructure, and improve housing choices. 2200.9 Context History 2201 European settlement in the Rock Creek East Area dates back to 1712, when St. Paul’s Episcopal Church was sited in the area. Rock Creek Cemetery was established in 1719. The area initially developed as a result of the presence of underground springs and the area’s popularity for recreational horse racing in the early to mid-1800s. Brightwood Turnpike, later renamed Georgia Avenue, was built in 1819 and served as a major route for race patrons and agricultural commerce between Maryland and downtown Washington. During the Civil War, Fort Totten, Fort Slocum and Fort Stevens were developed to defend the capital from attack. Fort Stevens was the site of Civil War combat in 1864, a battle that gained 505 notoriety as the only military action in which a sitting U.S. President came under fire from an enemy force. All three of the forts are now part of the National Park Service’s Fort Circle Parks, and the AREA ELEM ENTS COMPREHENSIVE PLAN DISTRICT ELEMENTS ADOPTED 12/19/06 P. 2-171 Battleground National Cemetery on Georgia Avenue is on the National Register of Historic Places. 2201.1 [Photo Caption: Battleground National Cemetery on Georgia Avenue] Following the Civil War, development in the area increased, especially along Georgia Avenue and Military Road. Farms, estates and summer homes were the first housing types to be developed. Toward the end of the 19th century, Brightwood became a suburban village where affluent families lived on large estates. As further development occurred, Brightwood was subdivided into the neighborhoods that we know today as Petworth, Brightwood Park, Brightwood and Lamond. 2201.2 On the northeast edge of Brightwood, Takoma Park was founded by Benjamin Gilbert in the early 1880s and developed around the Brightwood Railroad Station (later renamed Takoma Park Station) near Fourth Street and Blair Road. Many of its spacious wood-frame bungalows and Victorian homes remain today, and much of the neighborhood is a designated historic district. 2201.3 Federal facilities also shaped the growth of Rock Creek East. Chief among them were the U.S. Soldiers and Airmens Home, established in 1851 near Rock Creek Church Road, and Walter Reed Army Medical Center, built in 1909 on Georgia Avenue. Walter Reed’s development sparked residential and commercial development in surrounding areas. For example, the Shepherd Estate north of Walter Reed was subdivided in 1911 and developed as Shepherd Park during the 1910s. Shepherd Park initially was developed with restrictive covenants that excluded African-Americans and Jews from the community. However, by the 1960s, the neighborhood was the heart of the District’s Jewish community and today it is one of the most racially diverse neighborhoods in the city. 2201.4 The racial composition of Rock Creek East shifted during the 1950s and 1960s. The area was predominantly White prior to 1950, but by 1970 it was predominantly Black. The area became a desirable neighborhood for upper-middle and middle income Black professional families and the stately homes and subdivisions along 16th Street developed a cachet as Washington’s “Gold Coast.” Racial composition remained fairly constant during the 1970s and 1980s, but became more diverse during the 1990s as the number of Latino residents increased. 2201.5 Land Use 2202 Land use statistics for this Planning Area appear in Figure 22.1. Rock Creek East comprises about 4,800 acres, or about 12 percent of the city’s land area. 2202.1 [INSERT Figure 22.1:Land Use Composition in the Rock Creek East Area 2202.4] [Pie chart “slices” adjusted to reflect September 2006 change in Planning Area boundaries: Residential- 33 Comm/Ind-2 Streets-29 Parks/Open Space-18 Public Facilities-3 Federal-9 Institutiuonal-3 Rail/Utilities-2 Vacant-1%] The largest single land use in the Planning Area is residential, representing about 33 percent of the total area. Of the 1,635 acres of residential land in Rock Creek East, over 90 percent consists of single family homes and row houses. Densities are typically lower than the citywide average. The lowest density 506 areas are located west of 16th Street and in the Takoma and Shepherd Park areas. Concentrations of more dense housing exist in Brightwood, Brightwood Park and Petworth. The largest concentration of apartments is along the 14th Street corridor, particularly near Missouri Avenue and just north of Spring Road. 2202.2 AREA ELEM ENTS COMPREHENSIVE PLAN DISTRICT ELEMENTS ADOPTED 12/19/06 P. 2-172 Commercial and industrial uses make up just 2.5 percent of the Planning Area. Most of this land consists of retail and service businesses along Georgia Avenue and Kennedy Street NW, and in smaller commercial districts like Takoma and 14th Street Heights. Industrial areas total less than 20 acres and are located along the Metrorail/CSX tracks, generally following Blair Road. There are also light industrial uses between Taylor and Upshur Streets on the northwest edge of Petworth. 2202.3 Open space and parks comprise about 18 percent of the Planning Area. Most of this acreage is associated with Rock Creek Park and its stream valleys. The vast majority of the open space in the Planning Area is owned and operated by the National Park Service. Non-park federal properties comprise nine percent of the Planning Area. Almost all of this acreage is associated with Walter Reed and the Armed Forces Retirement Home. Public facilities and institutional uses each represent about three percent of the Planning Area. 2202.5 One of the largest land uses in the Planning Area is streets. Street rights-of-way, including roads, medians, alleys, traffic islands, and sidewalks, comprise 29 percent of Rock Creek East. There are only 22 acres of vacant land in the Planning Area, representing 0.5 percent of the total area. 2202.6 Demographics 2203 Basic demographic data for Rock Creek East is shown in Table 22.1. In 2000, the area had a population of 66,347 or about 12 percent of the city’s total. Population in the area declined by six percent during the 1990s. The number of households also declined, although not as steeply. Since 2000, the number of residents has declined slightly. Average household size in 2005 was estimated at 2.53. Although household size in the Planning Area has been falling for several decades, it is still well above the citywide average of 2.12. 2203.1 Approximately 77 percent of the area’s residents are African-American, which is higher than the citywide average of 60 percent. However, the number of Black residents in the Planning Area declined by over 10,000 during the 1990s. The number of White residents increased slightly representing about 10 percent of the total today. There was a 183 percent increase in the Hispanic population between 1990 and 2000; persons of Hispanic origin now represent 13 percent of the area’s population. This is double the average for the city as a whole. The percentage of foreign-born residents is also much higher than the citywide average. 2203.2 [PULLQUOTE: There was a 183 percent increase in the Hispanic population between 1990 and 2000; persons of Hispanic origin now represent 13 percent of the area’s population.

The 2000 Census 508 reported that 59 percent of the households in the Planning Area were homeowners (compared to 41 percent in the District) and 41 percent were renters (compared to 59 percent in the District About 61 percent of the area’s residents lived in the same house in 2000 as they did in 1995. This compares to a citywide average of 46.9 percent, and is indicative of the stability of the Rock Creek East community. 2204.2 Income and Employment 2205 Data from the Department of Employment Services and the Office of Planning indicates there were 31,600 jobs in Rock Creek East in 2005, primarily in health care, local-serving businesses, public schools, and government. This represents 4.2 percent of the city’s job base. The largest employment centers are hospitals, including Walter Reed Hospital, the Washington Hospital, the National Rehabilitation Hospital, Children’s National Medical Center, and the VA Hospital. Based on 2000 Census data, approximately 58 percent of the area’s jobs are held by Maryland residents and 12 percent by Virginia residents. Only about 30 percent of those who work in the Planning Area are District residents. 2205.1 Most employed residents in Rock Creek East commute to jobs within the District of Columbia. The 2000 Census indicated that 30 percent of the area’s commuters worked in Downtown Washington, nine percent worked within the Planning Area, 29 percent worked elsewhere in the District, and 32 percent commuted to the Maryland or Virginia suburbs. The Rock Creek East Planning Area has a higher percentage of residents driving alone to work than any of the other nine Planning Areas in the city—about 50 percent in 2000. 2205.2 The Planning Area’s median household income was $46,884 in 1999, which was slightly higher than the citywide median of $45,927. Approximately 13 percent of the area’s residents were below the federal poverty line. 2205.3 Projections 2206 Based on land availability, planning policies, and regional growth trends, Rock Creek East is projected to experience modest growth between 2005 and 2025. An increase of 3,400 households is projected, with the Planning Area reaching 28,800 households by 2025. Population is projected to grow by 13 percent over the 20-year period, reaching about 74,400 in 2025. The population forecasts presume that the federal government will proceed with redevelopment of portions of the Armed Forces Retirement Home; this growth represents more than one-third of the total for the Planning Area. Most of the remaining growth is projected to occur along Georgia Avenue, and near the Metro stations in Takoma and Petworth, consistent with the adopted Small Area Plans for each location. The forecasts do not assume housing development on Walter Reed Hospital. 2206.1 AREA ELEM ENTS COMPREHENSIVE PLAN DISTRICT ELEMENTS ADOPTED 12/19/06 P. 2-175 [PULLQUOTE: Based on land availability, planning policies, and regional growth trends, Rock Creek East is projected to experience modest growth between 2005 and 2025. An increase of 3,400 households is projected, with the Planning Area reaching 28,800 households by 2025. The number of jobs is expected to increase from about 30,900 today to 32,400 in 2025.] The number of jobs is expected to increase from about 31,600 today to 33,500 in 2025. These 509 forecasts presume a sharp drop in employment between 2010 and 2015 as federal jobs at Walter Reed Hospital are repositioned. However, they presume that most of these jobs will be replaced in the long run by new jobs on the site, and that additional employment growth will occur on Georgia Avenue, Kennedy Street, in the Washington Hospital Center complex, at the Armed Forces Retirement Home, and in other established business districts within the Planning Area. 2206.2 Planning and Development Priorities 2207 Three Comprehensive Plan workshops took place in Rock Creek East during the Comprehensive Plan revision. These meetings provided an opportunity for residents to discuss neighborhood planning issues as well as citywide issues. The Advisory Neighborhood Commissions and several Civic Associations were briefed on the Plan, providing additional input. There have also been many meetings in the community not directly connected to the Comprehensive Plan, but addressing long-range planning issues. These include Small Area Plan meetings for Takoma and Georgia Avenue/Petworth, as well as meetings on the Great Streets program, the city’s Parks and Recreation Master Plan, and various transportation studies. 2207.1 The community delivered several key messages during these meetings, summarized below: 2207.2 (a) Land use planning for Rock Creek East should protect and enhance the stable neighborhoods for which the area is known. Residents at Comp Plan meetings described their neighborhoods as “park- like” due to their tree cover, low densities, and proximity to Rock Creek Park. An important part of what creates the park-like ambiance is the large federal and institutional properties in the community. This is particularly true for Walter Reed Hospital and the Armed Forces Retirement Home, both of which may be redeveloped during the next two decades. Plans for these sites should make every effort possible to retain the open space, mature trees, and visual buffers that make these sites welcome neighbors in the community today. Residents at Comprehensive Plan meetings were also clear that design guidelines and zoning standards for these sites, and for other areas addressed by Small Area Plans, must be followed and enforced once they are prepared b) While protecting established neighborhoods is a priority, Rock Creek East also recognizes the need to provide a variety of housing choices. This community has always taken pride in the fact that it is economically integrated, with housing options for seniors, lower income households, young professionals, middle class families, and persons with special needs, as well as affluent households. Appropriate sites for infill housing have been identified along Georgia Avenue, around the Takoma Metro station, between Upshur and Taylor near 14th Street, along Kennedy Street, and on a limited number of other properties in the community. Development on these sites must be in keeping with the scale of the surrounding community, provide ample green space, address parking and traffic issues, upgrade infrastructure where needed, and serve a variety of incomes. Existing housing should continue to be renovated and rehabilitated, with programs to assist seniors and low-income residents and avoid displacement c) Neighborhood serving commercial facilities need to be upgraded and expanded throughout the Planning Area. Some of the commercial areas have suffered for decades from declining activity. Small 510 Area Plans for Takoma and Georgia Avenue have focused on ways to improve the future viability of the AREA ELEM ENTS COMPREHENSIVE PLAN DISTRICT ELEMENTS ADOPTED 12/19/06 P. 2-176 local business districts in each area and attract investment that better meets the needs of residents, businesses, and property owners. Similar attention should be given to Kennedy Street, and to the Riggs Road Center in the adjacent Upper Northeast Planning Area. Much of the area continues to be underserved by basic consumer services like banks, hardware stores, and sit-down restaurants. Rather than siting these uses in long auto-oriented “strips,” future development should emphasize pedestrianoriented “centers.” The community also expressed a strong preference for neighborhood-serving, rather than regional commercial uses. Such uses should be complementary to the low scale of existing development, and should enhance neighborhood identity through façade improvements, landscaping, signage, and lighting. Urban design excellence must be a very high priority. [Photo Caption: Neighborhood serving commercial on Colorado Avenue] (d) As neighborhood commercial areas are upgraded, the potential for conflicts due to traffic, noise, litter, and other environmental impacts must be recognized and proactively addressed. In addition, conflicts caused by existing commercial and industrial uses in the community need to addressed more effectively. This is particularly true in Petworth (along Georgia Avenue) and in Takoma and Lamond- Riggs near the CSX Railroad. For years, these neighborhoods have dealt with semi-industrial uses such as auto repair shops, bus storage, maintenance yards, and distribution centers, in some cases immediately adjacent to single family homes. These uses are important to the city and provide jobs and needed community services for Rock Creek East residents. But they also generate truck traffic, fumes, odors, noise, and vibration—often without buffering. Over the next 20 years, steps should be taken to reduce the land use conflicts and visual blight associated with industrial uses in such locations as Blair Road, Chillum Place, and Upshur Street. In a few cases, this may mean phasing out industrial and “heavy commercial” uses and replacing them with housing or mixed uses e) Residents of Rock Creek East have expressed concerns about the growth of particular land uses, including group homes, churches, and related facilities such as day care centers and social service centers. The Planning Area’s inventory of large homes, many located on major transit lines, has made it an attractive choice for social service providers and community based residential facilities. Issues relating to safety, parking, and neighborhood character have been raised, particularly in areas where group homes are clustered. Residents seek a stronger role in decisions on the siting and management of such facilities, and desire increased coordination with group home operators. There are also issues connected to code enforcement, related not only to special needs housing but to broader issues such as unpermitted construction and blighted properties f) Growth and development in neighboring jurisdictions particularly affects Rock Creek East. This is most apparent along Eastern Avenue in Shepherd Park, where tall condominiums in Silver Spring, Maryland face single family homes in the District. The revitalization of Downtown Silver Spring has provided exciting new shopping, entertainment, and dining options for area residents, but has also siphoned away some of the District’s retail potential and brought traffic to Shepherd Park. Takoma Park, Maryland is experiencing more modest growth near its border with the District. Regardless of location, it is important to ensure that neither jurisdiction bears an undue share of the impacts of growth related to traffic congestion and parking needs. Coordination between the District and Maryland is essential to 511 preserving community stability. Coordination should also emphasize improvement of gateways into the city at New Hampshire Avenue, Georgia Avenue, and 16th Streets. These entries define “first impressions” for residents on both sides of the state line, and to do not convey as positive an image of Washington as they could g) The transportation system should be designed so that residents can easily travel between home, work, school, shopping, and public facilities. Right now, the network is designed to facilitate north- south circulation (between Downtown and Maryland but east-west circulation is problematic. Improvements AREA ELEM ENTS COMPREHENSIVE PLAN DISTRICT ELEMENTS ADOPTED 12/19/06 P. 2-177 are needed to reduce traffic congestion and address safety concerns, particularly on Blair Road in Takoma, Georgia Avenue and Missouri Avenue in Brightwood and Riggs Road in Lamond Riggs. Better transportation to the west side of Rock Creek Park is also needed, as many residents travel in this direction to access schools, shopping, and Metrorail. Parts of Rock Creek East are more than one mile from Metrorail stations and need better, more reliable bus and bicycle connections. On the other hand, it should also be recognized that auto ownership is higher in Rock Creek East than it is in most other parts of the city. Transit is not a practical option for everyone, and adequate parking should be provided as development occurs. This was a clear message provided by many Comprehensive Plan participants in the area. The safety of pedestrians and bicyclists is also an issue in many neighborhoods and at many intersections. New traffic management measures, including street design changes, should be explored to better regulate traffic volume and flow, particularly where major development is proposed. Such changes have already been made to 16th Street and will need to be explored along Georgia Avenue as plans for Bus Rapid Transit along the avenue move forward. [PULLQUOTE: The transportation system should be designed so that residents can easily travel between home, work, school, shopping, and public facilities. Right now, the network is designed to facilitate north-south circulation (between Downtown and Maryland but east-west circulation is problematic. Improvements are needed to reduce traffic congestion and address safety concerns.] (h) A high priority must be placed on upgrading public services and facilities. The community has more recreation centers per capita than most parts of the District, but these facilities are not evenly distributed. Neighborhoods in the northern part of the Planning Area do not have a full-scale recreation center, while areas like Brightwood Park and Petworth are deficient in facilities like athletic fields and tennis courts. The new Takoma, Lamond, and Emery Recreation Centers are important additions, but maintenance of the parks themselves continues to be a concern. The Fourth District Police Headquarters is on Georgia Avenue, and there are fire stations in Petworth and Brightwood Park, but areas like North Portal and Colonial Village areas are several miles from the nearest station. Public libraries and schools in the community are in need of modernization. The community has the largest concentration of hospitals in the city, but they are clustered in the southern part of the Planning Area, with no facilities (other than Walter Reed) in the north. The new senior wellness center on Kennedy Street will provide a much 512 needed facility in a community where nearly one in five residents is over 65 i) The important historic resources in the Planning Area should be recognized and protected. The Fort Circle Parks are a resource of national importance, yet their significance is unknown even to many District residents. Additional interpretive facilities are needed, and the integrity and historic context of the parks themselves should be protected. The Takoma Historic District helps conserve the gracious homes and small-town architecture of Takoma, but other older neighborhoods and structures are not similarly protected. Important architectural resources like the Wardman rowhouses of Brightwood, the elegant older homes of 16th Street, and the legacy of early 20th century commercial buildings along Georgia Avenue remain vulnerable to demolition or unsympathetic alteration. Additional properties in the Planning Area may merit designation as historic landmarks or districts. Plans for neighborhood heritage trails in Brightwood and elsewhere will help preserve Rock Creek East’s legacy in the future. [Photo caption: Row houses in Petworth] (j) The Georgia Avenue corridor remains a source of great interest, concern, and hope. In March 2005, the entire 5.6 mile corridor was designated as one of six “Great Streets” in the city to be targeted for reinvestment. Participants in Comp Plan meetings pointed to various successes and failures along the Avenue, noting some positive signs but focusing on the large amount of work yet to be done. One issue raised was the limited demand for the Avenue’s small, narrow storefront spaces (with no off-street parking and the need to concentrate retail at key “nodes” rather than in a continuous strip. Additional AREA ELEM ENTS COMPREHENSIVE PLAN DISTRICT ELEMENTS ADOPTED 12/19/06 P. 2-178 programs and investments are needed to assist businesses, attract the desired mix of retail, resolve traffic problems, address problem land uses, and provide appropriately designed infill housing for seniors and others. Transit plans for the corridor were the subject of much discussion during the Comprehensive Plan process, with concerns expressed about impacts on parking and congestion. The link between plans for Upper Georgia Avenue and plans for Walter Reed Hospital also was raised. Regardless of what happens on the Hospital site, change should be leveraged to achieve positive results for Georgia Avenue and the neighborhoods around it. [PULLQUOTE: Participants in Comp Plan meetings pointed to various successes and failures along the Avenue, noting some positive signs but focusing on the large amount of work yet to be done.

It shares its history and its name with Takoma Park, Maryland. Both communities embody classic pedestrian-scale streets and a rich architectural legacy. The area’s principal business district along Carroll Street links the District and Maryland portions of the community. While the border is seamless, the District’s side lacks the streetscape, retail mix, and vitality of the Maryland side. Many Takoma DC residents find themselves shopping across the border in Maryland, even though their own commercial district has the capacity to offer many of the same retail amenities. 2211.1 AREA ELEM ENTS COMPREHENSIVE PLAN DISTRICT ELEMENTS ADOPTED 12/19/06 P. 2-183 [PULLQUOTE: Takoma is one of Washington’s most distinctive communities. It shares its history and its name with Takoma Park, Maryland. Both communities embody classic pedestrian-scale streets and a 517 rich architectural legacy.] A number of planning studies for the area have been completed over the years, including a 1977 Plan that anticipated the opening of Metro, a 1999 study that looked at ways to link the Maryland and DC commercial districts, and a 2002 Strategic Plan for the Takoma Central District. The Central District Plan was developed through an intensive public process and was adopted by the City Council as a Small Area Plan. It covered an area extending from Chestnut Street on the north, the Maryland/DC state line on the east, 4th and 5th Streets on the west, and Aspen and Laurel Streets on the south. The area includes the Metrorail station and the shopping districts along Carroll Street and 4th Street. It includes small shops with a variety of neighborhood serving businesses, a vacant theater, homes and apartments, parking lots, and vacant land. 2211.2 The Central District Plan (CDP) seeks to improve neighborhood retail choices, restore vacant buildings and storefronts, accommodate compatible infill housing, address traffic and parking conditions, enhance open space, and improve the safety and quality of the pedestrian environment. Key principles from the CDP are captured in the policies and actions below; the CDP itself should be consulted for additional detail. The Plan describes a vision for Central Takoma as a “Town Center,” with Metro serving as a gateway to new mixed use development, restored historic buildings, and pedestrian friendly streets. It places a priority on preserving the small-town character that embodies historic Takoma DC, emphasizing development that is in keeping with the low scale and businesses that serve the local community. 2211.3 Several specific sites were identified in the Central District Plan as housing opportunities. Since 2002, mixed use development projects such as Elevation 314 and Cedar Crossing have already been completed on some of these sites. A townhome development is currently proposed on the 6.8-acre Metrorail site itself, including live-work space, parking for Metro riders, and a new public park. Improvements to Carroll Avenue and Blair Road are planned to maintain traffic flow, and make the area safer for pedestrians. Future development in the Central Takoma area should maximize Metrorail access while taking care to provide appropriate buffers and transitions to adjacent uses. 2211.4 The Central District Plan was immediately followed by preparation of a Transportation Study for Takoma. The Study had several objectives, including improving safety for all modes of travel, reducing cut-through traffic, improving aesthetics, and balancing the needs of autos with those of pedestrians, transit users, and bicyclists. The Study also tested the effects of proposed development on the transportation network to ensure that impacts would be mitigated and that traffic flows would remain acceptable. A number of short-term and long-term recommendations were developed and are currently being implemented. 2211.5 Policy RCE-2.1.1: Historic Preservation in Takoma Recognize and respect Takoma’s rich heritage, architectural character and scale, and small town ambiance in all revitalization, urban design, and marketing strategies and initiatives. 2211.6 Policy RCE-2.1.2: Strategic Public and Private Investment in Takoma Target public investment in the Takoma Central District area in ways that can be leveraged to improve private investment and create public benefits. This should include streetscape and building façade improvements, partnerships with neighborhood and business organizations, and the development of key public properties. 2211.7 518 AREA ELEM ENTS COMPREHENSIVE PLAN DISTRICT ELEMENTS ADOPTED 12/19/06 P. 2-184 Policy RCE-2.1.3: Takoma Central District Housing Strategy Accommodate housing demand at the short-term and long-term opportunity sites identified in the Takoma Central District Plan. Short-term sites include vacant land, an auto service site, and the station parking area. Longer-term development sites include parking lots and light industrial areas which could potentially strengthen the Takoma Central District as a mixed-use, mixed income neighborhood. 2211.8 Policy RCE-2.1.4: Takoma Central District Retail Strategy Concentrate retail activities on key sites along Carroll Street and 4th Street through requirements that mandate ground floor retail space within the established business district. Continuous street walls and active ground floor retail should be encouraged in these areas, consistent with the Small Area Plan. Inappropriate uses, such as storage yards, auto sales, and warehouses, should be strictly limited. 2211.9 Policy RCE-2.1.5: Takoma Central District Transportation Strategy Place a priority on meeting transit needs at the Takoma Metro station and accommodate all Metro and Ride-On services on the station site itself. Incorporate Metropolitan Branch Trail options into all transportation improvements for the area. 2211.10 Action RCE-2.1-A: Traffic Congestion and Parking Mitigate intersection and corridor congestion on Blair Road and Carroll Street.

The Strategy recognizes the opportunity to reenergize Georgia Avenue as a thriving and attractive street, building on historic assets like the area’s building stock and relatively new assets like the Metrorail station. It includes strategies to strengthen existing businesses, restore abandoned storefronts, attract new mixed income development, address parking issues, and draw new businesses through financial and regulatory incentives. Several blocks along the Avenue are identified as new housing sites. Numerous parking, traffic flow, and pedestrian improvements are identified, such as more visible crosswalks, landscaped medians, and improved lighting. One of the Plan’s transportation recommendations—extension of Yellow Line train service—is already moving forward. 2212.3 [PULLQUOTE: A “Corridor Plan and Revitalization Strategy” was developed for Georgia Avenue Petworth in 2005. It provides a framework to guide future development and to enhance the quality of life in neighborhoods along the corridor. The Strategy recognizes the opportunity to reenergize Georgia Avenue as a thriving and attractive street, building on historic assets like the area’s building stock and relatively new assets like the Metrorail station.] Several mixed use projects are planned for the area. One of these is located on the 1.4-acre Metro station site at Petworth and will include ground floor retail and upper floor housing. This project should be a catalyst for other residential and mixed use projects planned or underway on Georgia Avenue. Future projects should include a diversity of housing types and retail amenities, oriented toward the needs of the surrounding community. 2212.4 Policy RCE-2.2.1: Development Character Encourage development in the Georgia Avenue/ Petworth area to respect the area’s pedestrian- oriented, moderate density character. A variety of project scales should be encouraged, ranging from small adaptive reuse and rehabilitation projects to mixed use projects combining housing and commercial uses. Mixed income housing with a variety of housing types is particularly encouraged. Any development of larger-scale buildings shall require architecturally sensitive scale transitions to adjacent, less dense development. 2212.5 Policy RCE-2.2.2: Strategic Public and Private Investment in Petworth Target capital improvements toward the locations that are best equipped to leverage new private development, particularly the 3600-4100 blocks of Georgia Avenue. These capital investments should include façade improvements, streetscape amenities, pedestrian safety measures, parking management improvements, and public art. 2212.6 Policy RCE-2.2.3: Limiting Undesirable Uses in Petworth Discourage uses deemed undesirable along Georgia Avenue, such as liquor stores, used car lots, and automobile repair shops. Provide flexibility for businesses with desirable uses that would like to expand their services and facilities. Such measures will help strengthen the economic vitality of the corridor, retain businesses, and serve the shopping needs of the surrounding neighborhoods. 2212.7 Policy RCE-2.2.4: Upshur/Taylor Industrial Area Recognize the opportunities for new housing, loft, and live-work development in the heavy commercial area located between Upshur, Shepherd, Georgia Avenue, and 13th Street. 2212.8 Action RCE-2.2-A: Site Acquisition Continue acquisition of underused or vacant land to facilitate public-private infill development that 520 catalyzes the revitalization of Georgia Avenue and reinforces its role as the central business district of Petworth. 2212.9 AREA ELEM ENTS COMPREHENSIVE PLAN DISTRICT ELEMENTS ADOPTED 12/19/06 P. 2-186 Action RCE-2.2-B: Petworth Co-Location Opportunities Explore opportunities to co-locate new and improved public facilities along Spring Road and on the Petworth Library/Roosevelt Senior High School/MacFarland Middle School campus. Consider other uses in the co-location development programs, such as a health care center, housing and senior living. 2212.10 Action RCE-2.2-C: Petworth Overlay Zone Consider an overlay zone for Georgia Avenue in Petworth that would restrict new uses deemed undesirable along the corridor, such as used automobile lots and automobile repair shops, and that would provide existing businesses with an allowance for additional floor area ratio to help them expand. 2212.11 Action RCE-2.2-D: Georgia and New Hampshire Avenue Intersection Enhance pedestrian safety, aesthetics and streetscape quality at the intersection of Georgia Avenue and New Hampshire Avenue, adjacent to Metro. This intersection is the hub of Petworth and requires crosswalk improvements and other changes to create a more desirable shopping district and favorable climate for new investment. The need for such improvements at the Georgia and Kansas Avenue intersection also should be assessed. 2212.12 Action RCE-2.2-E: Financial Incentives Consider financial and management incentives to assist existing businesses and new investors along Georgia Avenue, including a Tax Increment Financing District, a retail and leasing management strategy, and changes to the Façade Improvement Program. 2212.13 [Photo Caption: Illustrative rendering of planned development at the Petworth Metro station] RCE-2.3 Upper Georgia Avenue NW Walter Reed 2213 The Upper Georgia Avenue corridor extends more than 2.5 miles from Decatur Street north to Eastern Avenue. The corridor includes local and community-serving retail uses, gas stations, car dealerships, small offices, public and institutional buildings, and residential uses. The character of the corridor changes between Aspen Street and Fern Street, where Walter Reed Army Medical Center occupies the west side of the avenue and row houses and low-rise apartments line the east side. 2213.1 Portions of Upper Georgia Avenue lack retail diversity and has poor streetscape amenities, an unsafe pedestrian environment, and an aesthetic quality that is not in keeping with the high-quality residential areas on its east and west. The corridor has the potential to attract significant redevelopment, potentially supporting new retail, housing, and mixed use activity. It has many assets that are attractive to investors, including its historic building stock and proximity to a diverse community with significant purchasing power and a wide range of retail interests. 2213.2 One of the street’s challenges is its continuous “strip” development pattern. Looking to the future, development along Georgia Avenue should emphasize “nodes” at key locations. Nodes should be clearly identified by signage, lighting, paving, landscaping, and other physical features that define their identities and create a clearer sense of place. One example of such a node is the intersection of Georgia Avenue and Missouri Avenue/Military Road. This historic crossroads provides a logical location for a more welldefined, walkable retail district serving nearby neighborhoods. Another example is the area near Eastern 521 Avenue, which is a gateway to the District and an established shopping area. 2213.3 SIDEBAR: One of the street’s challenges is its continuous “strip” development pattern. Looking to the future, development along Georgia Avenue should emphasize “nodes” at key locations. Nodes should be AREA ELEM ENTS COMPREHENSIVE PLAN DISTRICT ELEMENTS ADOPTED 12/19/06 P. 2-187 clearly identified by signage, lighting, paving, landscaping, and other physical features that define their identities and create a clearer sense of place. More detailed assessments of Georgia Avenue are needed to identify the appropriate locations and “themes” for activity nodes, and to develop strategies for the commercially zoned areas in between them. Some of these areas may redevelop with housing over the next 20 years, particularly where existing uses are vacant or obsolete. 2213.4 Strategies for Upper Georgia Avenue must be coordinated with the evolving plans for the Walter Reed Army Medical Center (WRAMC In 2005, the site was identified for closure through the Base Realignment and Closure (BRAC) law. The law requires WRAMC-related employees, services and programs to vacate the site and move to other existing and/or planned facilities by the year 2011. As of Spring 2006, the Department of the Army had accepted the applications of the General Services Administration (GSA) and the Department of State (DOS) for reuse of the site. The decision means the entire site will be conveyed to these agencies and none of the property will be declared surplus. GSA’s proposal includes secure office space for the northern portion of the site and DOS’ proposal calls for foreign missions on the rest of the site. It is possible that these plans will change before the site is vacated. 2213.5 While the District does not have jurisdiction over Walter Reed, consultation between local and federal officials is necessary on many issues. These include historic preservation, adaptive reuse of existing buildings, environmental remediation, and transportation. The District will work closely with the federal government over the coming years to promote changes on the site that benefit the community, and to avoid land use conflicts, create community access and open space wherever feasible, and mitigate impacts on parking and community character. 2213.6 Policy RCE-2.3.1: Upper Georgia Avenue Develop Upper Georgia Avenue (from Decatur to Eastern) as a walkable shopping street with distinct and clearly identifiable activity centers along its course. Encourage development that reinforces a nodal pattern of development, with new retail or local-serving office development clustered at key locations and new housing or mixed use development on underutilized commercial properties in between. Conserve existing housing along the corridor and support its maintenance and renovation. 2213.7 Policy RCE-2.3.2: Pedestrian and Transit Improvements to Upper Georgia Avenue Improve transit access along Georgia Avenue to support existing and planned commercial activities. This should include transit improvements on the Avenue itself and better connections between the Avenue and other parts of the city. Improvements to the public realm also should be made, to make transit use safe, comfortable, and convenient. 2213.8 Policy RCE-2.3.3: Walter Reed Development Work with federal officials in ongoing discussions and on the disposition of Walter Reed Hospital. 522 The District will seek outcomes that preserve the stability and quality of neighborhoods around the site, minimize the potential for future land use and transportation conflicts, preserve open space buffers between the site and its neighbors, provide community amenities wherever feasible, and create educational and employment opportunities that benefit District residents. 2213.9 [Photo Caption: Walter Reed Hospital] Action RCE-2.3-A: Upper Georgia Avenue Area Plan Develop a small area plan and implementation strategy focused on the properties fronting on Georgia Avenue between Decatur Street and Eastern Avenue. The small area plan should identify the commercial AREA ELEM ENTS COMPREHENSIVE PLAN DISTRICT ELEMENTS ADOPTED 12/19/06 P. 2-188 nodes along the corridor, develop strategies for encouraging housing in areas in between these nodes, and provide guidance on the appropriate mix of land uses and measures to avoid the over-concentration of undesirable uses. 2213.10 Action RCE-2.3-B: Land Acquisition on Upper Georgia Avenue Acquire vacant and/or underutilized private land along Upper Georgia Avenue which can be leveraged to support private revitalization and reinvestment. The production of mixed income housing should be a top priority where land is acquired. 2213.11 RCE-2.4 Kennedy Street NW 2214 Kennedy Street NW spans the Brightwood Park and South Manor Park neighborhoods. The street is mixed use in character, with low-density storefront commercial uses, as well as residential uses. Apartment buildings, rowhouses and single-family detached homes line the streets immediately adjacent to the corridor and parts of Kennedy Street itself. The street also serves as one of the few east-west transit routes in the Rock Creek East Planning Area. 2214.1 During the last several years, the District has targeted resources to the area for crime prevention, community clean-up, and public safety. This has generated interest in the area and attracted new residents. While the neighborhoods surrounding the corridor are quite stable, demographic changes have altered the kinds of retail services that are needed. Typical businesses on the corridor currently include convenience stores, beauty/barber shops and carry-outs. Over the next two decades, Kennedy Street should evolve into a more vibrant mixed use shopping area, with vacant storefronts reoccupied once again and new opportunities for local-serving businesses. The success of existing businesses also should be encouraged as this revival occurs. 2214.2 The large senior population in the Brightwood area creates the need for additional senior housing and assisted living facilities in this area. The revitalization of Kennedy Street provides an opportunity for such development, possibly combined with retail uses and senior services. A new Wellness Center on the street will provide a potential catalyst for new senior housing. 2214.3 [Photo Caption: Kennedy Street] Policy RCE-2.4.1: Kennedy Street Improvement Improve Kennedy Street between Georgia Avenue and 1st Street NW as a locally-oriented neighborhood shopping street. A distinct identity should be created for the street in order to boost the performance of existing businesses and attract new businesses to the vacant storefronts on the corridor. 2214.4 Policy RCE-2.4.2: Housing along Kennedy Street Encourage moderate density mixed use projects along Kennedy Street, including housing. Capitalize on the new Wellness Center by promoting new housing for seniors in its vicinity. 2214.5 523 Action RCE-2.4.A: Complete Kennedy Street Strategic Development Plan Develop a small area plan and implementation strategy focused on vacant and underutilized commercial properties along Kennedy Street. The Plan should identify the potential for new and expanded residential, commercial and mixed-use development, and should include actions to make the area more a more attractive place for local residents to shop. 2214.6 Action RCE-2.4-B: Main Street Designation Consider the designation of Kennedy Street as a DC Main Street, thereby creating a vehicle for business improvement and technical assistance 2214.7 AREA ELEM ENTS COMPREHENSIVE PLAN DISTRICT ELEMENTS ADOPTED 12/19/06 P. 2-189 RCE-2.5 Armed Forces Retirement Home/ Irving Street Hospital Campus 2215 The Armed Forces Retirement Home (AFRH formerly known as the U.S. Soldiers and Airmens Home, is a functioning home for almost 1,400 veterans of the U.S. Military. It occupies a 272-acre site in the southeast part of the Planning Area. 2215.1 The AFRH has been an institution of national importance for more than 150 years, and is both a DC Historic Landmark and is a National Register of Historic Places landmark. The property has exceptional significance as a natural, cultural, historic, and scenic resource and is one of the largest contiguous properties in the District of Columbia. President Abraham Lincoln maintained a cottage on the site and wrote parts of the Emancipation Proclamation while residing there in 1862. The Federal Elements of the Comprehensive Plan acknowledge the significance of the AFRH as an important public open space. 2215.2 [PULLQUOTE: The property has exceptional significance as a natural, cultural, historic, and scenic resource and is one of the largest contiguous properties in the District of Columbia.] The AFRH completed a new master plan in 2005. Because of a limited revenue stream, the AFRH was authorized by Congress to leverage its principal asset—land—to make up shortfalls in the trust fund that finances its operations. Its master plan calls for consolidation of operations in the northern core of the campus, retention of the golf course, and development of the remainder of the campus over the next 20 years. Preliminary federal plans call for urban densities on much of the site, with a combination of residential, retail, institutional, and office uses. 2215.2 The prospect of redevelopment creates exciting opportunities but also raises concerns about the scale of development, provisions for open space, traffic and environmental impacts, effects on visual and historic resources, and the compatibility of the development with the surrounding row house neighborhoods. The District currently has limited jurisdiction over the site, but is working with the federal government to ensure that the impacts of future development are mitigated, and that the site plan establishes compatible transitions in density and preserves appropriate areas as open space. As portions of the site are sold to the private sector, they should be subject to zoning and new Comprehensive Plan Map designations by the District. 2215.3 To the south of the AFRH, the Irving Street Hospital Campus includes approximately 50 acres of health care related uses located between Michigan Avenue NW, Irving Street NW, Park Place NW, and First 524 Street NW. The hospital complex includes approximately 8,000 employees. Facilities include the Washington Hospital Center, Children’s Hospital National Medical Center, the National Rehabilitation Hospital and the Veterans Administration Hospital. The Washington Hospital Center, founded in 1958, is the largest private hospital in the District. 2215.4 In the future, expansion of hospital facilities may be necessary to maintain appropriate levels of care to a growing population and to support new medical care initiatives. This expansion may include ancillary uses such as medical office buildings, clinics, hotels, and conference facilities. 2215.5 Policy RCE-2.5.1: AFRH Redevelopment Ensure that any future development of the Armed Forces Retirement Home is sensitive to and compatible with surrounding uses. The scale of development should reflect prevailing densities in adjacent communities. The highest densities should be clustered along North Capitol Street and near the Irving Street Hospital area. It is critical that the western edge of the site near the Park View, Pleasant Plains, Petworth, and University Heights areas be retained as open space, with public access restored as it was when these neighborhoods were initially developed. 2215.6 AREA ELEM ENTS COMPREHENSIVE PLAN DISTRICT ELEMENTS ADOPTED 12/19/06 P. 2-190 Policy RCE-2.5.2: Housing Opportunities Strongly support a variety of housing types, developed at a range of densities and serving a range of incomes, in the event the Armed Forces Retirement Home is developed. The opportunity to develop larger units suitable for families on the site should be recognized. Gated communities should be discouraged on this site. 2215.7 Policy RCE-2.5.3: Resource Protection To the greatest extent possible, require the protection of panoramic views, historic landmarks, and important historic landscapes on the Armed Forces Retirement Home site. The historic links between this site and adjacent land at the McMillan Sand Filtration site and the 49-acre property acquired by Catholic University should be reflected in its design and planning. 2215.8 [Photo Caption: The Armed Forces Retirement Home (AFRH) has been a functioning home for veterans of the U.S. Military for more than a century] Policy RCE-2.5.4: Open Space Conservation Encourage the designation of a substantial portion of the Armed Forces Retirement Home as open space and public parkland as the site is made available for reuse, particularly on the western perimeter of the site where it abuts residential uses. A linear park connection extending from this site south through the Irving Street Hospital Campus and McMillan Reservoir Sand Filtration site to LeDroit Park should be pursued. 2215.9 Policy RCE-2.5.5: Irving Street Hospital Campus Development Encourage continued development of the Irving Street Hospital Campus with hospitals and health care services. Promote land uses that are flexible enough to accommodate the future needs of the facilities while considering the impacts to the surrounding residential areas and the additional impact to the District’s roadway, infrastructure and public service resources. 2215.10 Action RCE-2.5-A: AFRH Master Plan Coordination Coordinate with the AFRH, NCPC, and General Services Administration to review the AFRH Master Plan with attention to desired land uses, zoning, building height, intensity of proposed development, circulation, open space, infrastructure, and public services. Site plan review must be carefully 525 coordinated to address potential impacts. 2215.11 Action RCE-2.5-B: Irving Street Hospital Campus Strategic Planning Coordinate with hospital operators on the Irving Street Hospital campus to ensure that necessary facility expansions are well planned and mitigate potential adverse impacts on surrounding areas. Review existing hospital facility strategic plans to determine appropriate land uses and determine if zoning changes are needed. 2215.12 AREA ELEM ENTS COMPREHENSIVE PLAN DISTRICT ELEMENTS ADOPTED 12/19/06 P. 2-191 CHAPTER 23 ROCK CREEK WEST AREA ELEMENT [Note: The map which appears on the page facing 23-1 has been corrected so that Foxhall Village is shown in the correct location and Georgetown Reservoir is deleted] Overview 2300 The Rock Creek West Planning Area encompasses 13 square miles in the northwest quadrant of the District of Columbia. The Planning Area is bounded by Rock Creek on the east, Maryland on the north/west, and the Potomac River and Whitehaven Parkway on the south. Its boundaries are shown in the Map at left. Most of this area has historically been Council Ward 3 although in past and present times, parts have been included in Wards 1, 2, and 4. 2300.1 Rock Creek West’s most outstanding characteristic is its stable, attractive neighborhoods. These include predominantly single family neighborhoods like Spring Valley, Forest Hills, American University Park, and Palisades; row house and garden apartment neighborhoods like Glover Park and McLean Gardens; and mixed density neighborhoods such as Woodley Park, Chevy Chase, and Cleveland Park. Although these communities retain individual and distinctive identities, they share a commitment to proactively addressing land use and development issues and conserving neighborhood quality. 2300.2 Some of the District’s most important natural and cultural resources are located in Rock Creek West. These resources include Rock Creek Park, the National Zoo, Glover Archbold Park, Battery Kemble Park, and Fort Reno Park as well as numerous smaller parks and playgrounds. Many of these areas serve as resources for the entire city. Cultural resources include the Washington National Cathedral; American University, the University of the District of Columbia, Howard Law School and George Washington University’s Mt. Vernon Campus; numerous churches; and several museums, including the Kreeger and Hillwood. The neighborhoods themselves are an important cultural resource, with several historic districts and many historic landmarks. Rock Creek West is also the location of the Naval Observatory and the home of the U.S. Vice President. 2300.3 Despite its residential character, Rock Creek West actually has more jobs than households. The community is host to major corporations such as Fannie Mae and Intelsat, and three of the region’s commercial television stations. It includes a large number of foreign missions, including the International Chancery Complex at Van Ness Avenue. Several large hotels are located in the community, including the Omni-Shoreham and Marriott Wardman Park near the Woodley Park Metro station. Some of the District’s most vibrant retail districts are located around the area’s Metro stations and along its major corridors. Commercial overlay zones have been created in three of these areas, allowing a mix of retail uses and retaining a human scale and pedestrian character along neighborhood shopping streets. Much of the commercial land use in the area is located along the Wisconsin and Connecticut Avenue 526 corridors in shopping districts like Friendship Heights and Cleveland Park. While the presence of these uses is generally positive and creates some of the most livable neighborhoods in the city, the downside is that major thoroughfares are often congested and residential side streets are burdened with parking problems. 2300.4 The Rock Creek West area has strong economic momentum, leading to past and present concerns about the effects of unrestrained development on traffic, public services, and quality of life. This creates a different dynamic than is present in many District neighborhoods, and reduces the need for government AREA ELEM ENTS COMPREHENSIVE PLAN DISTRICT ELEMENTS ADOPTED 12/19/06 P. 2-192 programs to stimulate private investment. The combination of a relatively affluent population, excellent transportation (including five Metro stations with some of the system’s highest non-CBD ridership levels stable and attractive neighborhoods, high-quality retail, and a limited supply of vacant land, has led to very strong market demand. This in turn has led to an emphasis on growth control rather than growth incentives. The need to appropriately control and guide growth, and to protect neighborhoods, remains a top priority throughout the community and is a major theme of this Element. 2300.5 The demand for housing also has been consistently strong in Rock Creek West. During the 1980s and 1990s, when the District was losing residents, neighborhoods west of Rock Creek Park continued to add households. Growth has resulted from a combination of factors, including relatively low crime rates, numerous neighborhood amenities, accessible neighborhood retail, convenient Metrorail access, active community organizations, and relatively high-performing public schools with strong parental support. 2300.6 These same factors have created a continuing affordable housing dilemma in the community. In 2005, the median purchase price of a home exceeded $800,000 in every zip code west of the Park. Tax assessments have escalated as home prices have increased, placing a burden on many residents—especially seniors and those with low and moderate incomes. Rents have also escalated, and the overall supply of rental units has decreased as apartments have converted to condominiums. Although there are limited opportunities for new housing development in the area, there continues to be a substantial unmet need for new affordable units and a need to protect the remaining affordable units in an environment where affordable units are being eliminated. 2300.7 The preservation and improvement of the natural environment is also a high priority in Rock Creek West. The community is fortunate to have one of the densest tree canopies in the city, several community gardens, the Capital Crescent Trail, and more park and open space acreage than any other Planning Area in the city. However, development on the fringes of the parks has caused erosion and diminished water quality and views in some places. Tree and slope overlay zones have been created in several locations to address this issue. 2300.8 The sense of community in Rock Creek West is reinforced by a particularly active network of neighborhood associations, Advisory Neighborhood Commissions, and involved residents. Wellorganized Citizens Associations serve many of the area’s neighborhoods, including AU Park, Chevy Chase, Cleveland Park, Forest Hills, Foxhall, Glover Park, Palisades, Spring Valley, Wesley Heights, 527 Tenleytown, and Woodley Park. A number of Historical Societies and interest groups are also actively involved in community affairs. These groups shape local land use and development decisions, and provide guidance on a wide range of issues relating to transportation, community services, public safety, and other long-range planning concerns. 2300.9 [Photo Caption: Single family homes in North Cleveland Park] Context History 2301 The first settlements in Rock Creek West developed along roads connecting the port of Georgetown to the countryside north and west of the city. One of the first settlements was at the juncture of Georgetown Pike (now Wisconsin Avenue) and River Road, where there was a toll station. John Tennally opened a tavern at the intersection around 1790, giving his name to the area now called Tenleytown. Several large AREA ELEM ENTS COMPREHENSIVE PLAN DISTRICT ELEMENTS ADOPTED 12/19/06 P. 2-193 estates were developed in the area during the 1800s, including the estate of Colonel Joseph Belt (named Chevy Chase Major John Adlum’s 200-acre “vineyard” in what is now North Cleveland Park, and the Henry Foxhall estate in modern-day Foxhall. 2301.1 The C&amp;amp;O Canal was completed in 1843, and a parallel road (now MacArthur Boulevard) was constructed to the city’s water intake facilities at Great Falls. The canal prompted industrial development along the Potomac River and in the Palisades, including a foundry and several slaughterhouses along Canal and Foxhall Roads. The Rock Creek West area developed strategic military importance during the Civil War, when Fort Reno, Fort DeRussy, Fort Bayard, Battery Kemble, and other fortifications were developed. 2301.2 The area remained rural after the Civil War. The Potomac Palisades became popular as a summer retreat for wealthy Washingtonians. Land adjacent to Fort Reno, meanwhile, was occupied by former slaves who came north in search of homes and land. Their community, dubbed “Reno City,” remained until the 1930s when the District developed Deal and Wilson Schools, and the National Park Service developed Fort Reno Reservoir. Another community of freed slaves developed along Chain Bridge Road in the Palisades. 2301.3 Development in the Rock Creek West area began in earnest around 1890. In that year, Senators William Steward and Francis Newlands founded the Chevy Chase Land Company. The company was responsible for the extension of Connecticut Avenue into Maryland, construction of a trolley line, and the development of the residential community of Chevy Chase. Also in 1890, Congress dedicated 1,700 acres along the Rock Creek Valley as Rock Creek Park—defining development, transportation, and demographic patterns that would shape the city during the century to come. Other defining moments of the era included the groundbreaking for American University in 1893, and the start of construction on the National Cathedral in 1907. 2301.4 [PULLQUOTE: Development in the Rock Creek West area began in earnest around 1890. In that year, Senators William Steward and Francis Newlands founded the Chevy Chase Land Company. The 528 company was responsible for the extension of Connecticut Avenue into Maryland, construction of a trolley line, and the development of the residential community of Chevy Chase.] Rapid residential development took place during the early 20th century as the Rock Creek rail line began operating on Connecticut Avenue and electric streetcar lines were extended up Wisconsin Avenue and through the Palisades to Glen Echo. Many of the large estates were subdivided during the 1890s and early 1900s. The country estate of President Grover Cleveland for example, was developed as the Cleveland Park neighborhood. Much of the land owned by the Methodist church was developed as American University Park. Row house neighborhoods like Woodley Park, Glover Park, and Foxhall Village were also developed during this period. By the 1920s and 1930s, apartment construction was occurring up and down Connecticut Avenue, with structures like Cathedral Mansions (built in 1924) and the Kennedy-Warren (built in 1931) defining the avenue’s image as a desirable residential address. 2301.5 During World War II, the federal government razed the country estate of John R. McLean to build wartime housing in what would become McLean Gardens. The Defense Home Corporation built a mix of apartment buildings and dormitories for military personnel. After the war, the units were converted to private apartments and the dormitories were later torn down. The 30-building complex was converted to condominiums in 1980 and houses over 1,000 residents today. 2301.6 By the 1960s, the land use pattern was well established. Connecticut Avenue had apartment buildings interspersed with retail shopping areas. Wisconsin Avenue still had expanses of single family residences, AREA ELEM ENTS COMPREHENSIVE PLAN DISTRICT ELEMENTS ADOPTED 12/19/06 P. 2-194 but mid-rise apartment and office buildings were being constructed on some blocks. The development of Metro led to additional development in the 1970s, including the University of the District of Columbia and the Mazza Gallerie in Friendship Heights. By the late 1990s, almost all privately-owned land in the community had been developed. In spite of this fact, much of Rock Creek West retains a small town character today. The area’s attractive and well kept housing stock, tree-lined streets, neighborhoodoriented shopping districts, and well-used parks and public facilities make this one of the most desirable parts of the city. 2301.7 Land Use 2302 Land use statistics for the Rock Creek West Planning Area appear in Figure 23.1. The Planning Area comprises about 8,300 acres, or about 19 percent of the District. This total includes 7,980 acres of land and 315 acres of water. 2302.1 [INSERT Figure 23.1: Land Use Composition: Rock Creek West 2302.3] [Pie Chart “slices” unchanged from July draft] Residential uses represent the largest single land use in the Planning Area, accounting for about 37 percent of the total. Of the residential acreage, 80 percent is developed with single family detached homes. About 10 percent is developed with semi-detached homes, row houses, and other attached single family housing. The remaining 10 percent is developed with apartments. Higher density housing is concentrated along the Connecticut Avenue corridor, along Massachusetts Avenue between Ward Circle and Idaho Avenue, and along Lower Wisconsin Avenue. Densities in most of the area are well below the citywide average, although individual blocks along the avenues contain some of the densest housing in the city. 2302.2 Commercial land uses occupy just 2 percent of the area. Major commercial centers are located 529 around the five Metro Stations, in walkable shopping districts along the avenues, and in neighborhood shopping centers like Spring Valley. Institutional uses make up about 8 percent of the land area. These uses include American University, Sibley Hospital, and the campuses of numerous private schools and religious institutions. There are no industrial uses in Rock Creek West. 2302.4 Parks and open space comprise 25 percent of the Planning Area. The majority of this acreage is owned by the National Park Service, including Rock Creek Park, the national parklands along the Potomac River, and Glover Archbold Park. Street rights-of-way represent about 22 percent of the Planning Area, which is somewhat lower than the citywide average. Local public and federal government facilities comprise about 5 percent of the land area. A majority of this acreage is contained within federal complexes such as the Naval Security Center and the Naval Observatory. Only about one percent of the Planning Area consists of private, undeveloped (vacant) land. 2302.5 Demographics 2303 Basic demographic data for the Rock Creek West Planning Area is shown in Table 23.1. The area was one of the only parts of the city to experience an increase in population during the 1990s, adding about 2,000 residents while the city as a whole lost over 30,000 people. Population has continued to increase since 2000. The 2005 population is estimated at 85,800, or about 15 percent of the city’s total. 2303.1 [Photo Caption: The area was one of the only parts of the city to experience an increase in population during the 1990s] AREA ELEM ENTS COMPREHENSIVE PLAN DISTRICT ELEMENTS ADOPTED 12/19/06 P. 2-195 In 2005, the average household size is estimated to be 1.86. This is well below the citywide median of 2.12, although household size has not fallen as fast in this Planning Area as it has in other parts of the city. Whereas household size in the District as a whole dropped from 2.42 in 1990 to 2.12 in 2005, it only dropped from 1.91 to 1.86 in Rock Creek West. The area continues to sustain a large population of oneperson households in apartment buildings, and a large number of families in single family homes. 2303.2 Approximately 83 percent of the area’s residents are white, which is significantly higher than the citywide average of 30 percent. Only about 6 percent of the area’s residents are black, and only about 6 percent are of Hispanic origin. Nearly 20 percent of the residents are foreign born, which is substantially higher than the citywide average. The area has a lower percentage of children and a higher percentage of seniors relative to the city as a whole. About 12 percent of the residents are under 18, compared to a citywide average of 20 percent. About 15 percent are over 65, compared to the citywide average of 12 percent. The percentage of seniors has declined since 1990, when it was 17 percent. 2303.3 Housing Characteristics 2304 The 2000 Census reported that 30 percent of the housing units in Rock Creek West were single family detached homes, and 10 percent were single family attached homes (row houses, semi-detached homes, and townhouses The percent of single family detached housing is more than twice the citywide percentage. At the same time, the Planning Area also contains almost twice the percentage of units in large multi-family buildings compared to the city as a whole. More than 42 percent of the housing units in Rock Creek West are contained in multi-family buildings of 50 units of more, compared to 23 percent 530 citywide. 2304.1 The 2000 Census reported that 52 percent of the households in the Planning Area were homeowners and 47 percent were renters. This compares to citywide figures of 41 percent and 59 percent respectively. The percentage of homeowners in the Planning Area has been increasing; whereas renters outnumbered homeowners in 1990, the reverse was true by 2000. The percentage of vacant housing units in the Planning Area is low—standing at less than 4 percent in 2000 compared to a citywide average of almost 10 percent. 2304.2 [Photo Caption: More than 30 percent of the housing units in Rock Creek West are single family detached homes—more than twice the citywide percentage] Income and Employment 2305 Data from the Department of Employment Services and the Office of Planning indicates there were 48,500 jobs in Rock Creek West in 2005, primarily in professional offices, international organizations, local-serving businesses, public schools, universities, and government. This represents approximately 6.5 percent of the city’s job base. According to Census “journey to work” data, about 34 percent of the jobs in the Planning Area are filled by District residents, about 42 percent by Maryland residents, and about 18 percent by Virginia residents. This same data indicates that 39 percent of employed Rock Creek West residents commute to Downtown Washington, 13 percent work within the Rock Creek West Area, 22 percent commute elsewhere in the District, and 26 percent commute to the suburbs. 2305.1 The Rock Creek West Planning Area has the highest median income in the city. The 2000 Census reported the median at $80,802, compared to a citywide median of $45,927. The area’s stability and affluence benefit the city by significantly contributing to the tax base while requiring a lower level of publicly subsidized services. Nonetheless, approximately seven percent of the area’s residents lived below the federal poverty level in 2000. Many were elderly, with special housing and transportation needs. 2305.2 AREA ELEM ENTS COMPREHENSIVE PLAN DISTRICT ELEMENTS ADOPTED 12/19/06 P. 2-196 Table 23.1: Rock Creek West at a Glance 2303.4 Basic Statistics Land Area (sq. miles — excl. water) 12.5 Population 1990 82,428 2000 84,119 2005 (estimated 85,800 2025 (projected 91,200 Households (2005 42,400 Household Population (2005 exclu des grou p qu arters 78,900 Persons Per Household (2005 1.86 Jobs (2005 48,500 Density (persons per sq mile 2005 6,900 Year 2000 Census Data Profile Rock Creek West Planning Area Citywide Total of Total of Total Age Under 18 10,448 12.4 20.0 18-65 60,966 72.4 67.8 Over 65 12,705 15.2 12.2 Residents Below Poverty Level 5,829 6.9 20.2 Racial Composition White 70,132 83.4 30.4 Black 5,401 6.4 60.3 Native American 197 0.2 0.3 Asian/ Pacific Islander 4,398 5.2 2.6 Other 1,746 2.1 2.8 Multi-Racial 2,246 2.7 5.2 Hispanic Origin 5,397 6.4 7.8 Foreign-Born Residents 15,804 18.8 12.8 Tenure Owner Households 21,488 52.1 40.7 Renter Households 19,784 47.9 59.3 531 Population 5+ yrs in same house in 2000 as in 1995 37,112 46.0 46.9 Housing Occupancy Occupied Units 41,272 96.2 90.4 Vacant Units 1,646 3.8 9.6 Housing by Unit Type 1-unit detached 12,866 30.0 13.1 1-unit attached 4,511 10.5 26.4 2-4 units 1,238 2.9 11.0 5-9 units 1,631 3.8 8.0 10-19 units 1,346 3.1 10.3 20-49 units 3,149 7.3 7.4 50+ units 18,157 42.3 23.3 Mobile/ other 20 0.1 0.2 Figures noted with an asterisk are estimates developed by the Office of Planning and the Department of Employment Services based on a variety of data sources Total population of subcategories may not match 2000 Census totals due to sampling errors. AREA ELEM ENTS COMPREHENSIVE PLAN DISTRICT ELEMENTS ADOPTED 12/19/06 P. 2-197 Projections 2306 Given its largely built out character, Rock Creek West is projected to be among the slowest growing areas of the city during the next 20 years. Fewer than 3,000 additional households are forecast for the 2005- 2025 period, which is comparable to the annual growth rate experienced during 1990-2005. A 6 percent increase in population, from 85,800 to about 91,000, is projected. Most of the growth is expected to consist of multi-family housing in mixed use projects along the avenues, and single family homes on scattered vacant sites such as the 17-acre St. Patrick’s property on Foxhall Road. 2306.1 The number of jobs is expected to increase from about 48,500 today to 51,600 in 2025. Most of the increase is likely to take place in proximity to the Metro stations as additional retail and local-serving office development occurs. 2306.2 Planning and Development Priorities 2307 Three large Comprehensive Plan workshops took place in Rock Creek West during 2005 and 2006. These meetings provided a chance for residents and local businesses to discuss both citywide and neighborhood planning issues. Many smaller meetings on the Comprehensive Plan also took place in the community, including briefings and workshops with Advisory Neighborhood Commissions and neighborhood organizations. 2307.1 There have also been many meetings in the community not directly connected to the Comprehensive Plan, but focusing on related long-range planning issues. These meetings have covered topics such as the future development of Upper Wisconsin Avenue, streetscape improvements along the Glover Park commercial corridor, and proposals for individual properties. 2307.2 The community delivered several key messages during these meetings, summarized below. 2307.3 (a) Residents of the Rock Creek West Planning Area remain deeply concerned about growth. While there is support for development on underutilized sites along the major corridors, issues of height, scale, character, and density remain a source of concern as well as a source of debate within the community. The relatively low-density commercial zoning on most of the corridors has not provided the predictability that many residents seek. The approval of planned unit developments (PUDs) has brought neighborhood amenities but has also resulted in density “bonuses” that are beyond what many residents find acceptable. The potential impact of density increases on schools, emergency response and safety, infrastructure, traffic, parking, environmental health and neighborhood character lead residents to conclude that the only acceptable growth rate is one which matches infrastructure capacity. [PULLQUOTE: While there is support for development on underutilized sites along the major 532 corridors, issues of height, scale, character, and density remain a source of concern as well as a source of debate within the community.] (b) Rock Creek West has the unique characteristic of containing some of the city’s most dense and least dense neighborhoods—sometimes side by side. Along parts of Connecticut and Wisconsin Avenues, multi-story apartment buildings abut single family homes along rear lot lines. These uses successfully co-exist in part because of the significant buffering effects of open space, parking lots, alleys, mature trees and shrubbery, changes in topography, and other screening and site planning measures. Neighborhoods seek assurances that existing buffers will be maintained and that additional AREA ELEM ENTS COMPREHENSIVE PLAN DISTRICT ELEMENTS ADOPTED 12/19/06 P. 2-198 buffers, setbacks, and a “stepping down” in building heights will be provided if and when infill development occurs along the corridors c) Like the rest of the District of Columbia, Rock Creek West is facing an affordable housing crisis. Home prices here are the highest in the city and many residents could not afford the homes they live in now if they were first-time buyers today. The conversion of formerly modest apartments to upscale condominiums has created a burden for low- and moderate-income renters, seniors, and young workers just entering the job market. On the other hand, these conversions have provided a more affordable alternative to individuals and families that would otherwise have been priced out of the community entirely. There is broad support for requirements to include affordable or “workforce” housing units within new market-rate projects, but the prospect of “density bonuses” and other zoning flexibility in exchange for these units continues to raise objections. [Photo Caption: Woodley Park row houses] (d) A better variety of retail choices is needed in some parts of the Planning Area. It is acknowledged that the area does not need public action or the involvement of non-profit community development corporations to attract retail in the same way that other parts of the District do. However, some neighborhoods still lack the range of goods and services needed to support the basic needs of local residents. High costs are having a negative effect on some of the area’s small businesses, leading to a loss of small “mom and pop” businesses and family-owned neighborhood institutions. The community continues to favor neighborhood-serving retail rather than office space along the corridors, both to meet community needs and to avoid uses that would generate commuter traffic e) Some of the area’s commercial streets lack the vitality and elegance of great pedestrian-oriented neighborhood shopping streets. Recent efforts to renovate existing commercial buildings in Friendship Heights have generally been well-received and have created a more vibrant pedestrian environment. There is support for development that emphasizes walkability over auto-orientation, provided that height, scale, parking, infrastructure capacity, and other issues can be reconciled f) Traffic congestion and pedestrian safety are also major problems. The radial street pattern results in very high volumes along major corridors, particularly Connecticut, Wisconsin, Massachusetts, and Western Avenues, MacArthur Boulevard, Military Road, River Road, and Canal Road. Local trips combine with commuter traffic to and from the Maryland suburbs and I-495, pushing many intersections beyond their design capacities. As is the case in many parts of the city, major arterials are at Level of Service “D” or “E” during the peak hours, with stop and go traffic. The prior Ward Plan for this area suggested that traffic be restored to Level of Service “B” or “C” —yet such conditions could never be attained without massive road reconstruction and removal of major trip generators. This is neither a realistic or desirable solution. Consequently, more integrated solutions to traffic control, including bus improvements, bicycle improvements, transportation demand management programs for new 533 development, and more efficient use of existing roadways (such as synchronized traffic signals are needed g) Parking is also an issue. On-street parking has been removed in some locations to facilitate traffic flow, which has exacerbated parking needs on side streets. Residential permit parking has helped, but additional parking management measures are needed. Some residents have suggested municipal parking garages. Others have called for limits on development as a way to control parking demand. Still others have suggested that developers build more parking spaces than are required by law, or that the District limit the issuance of residential parking permits. There are clearly pros and cons to these options. One downside of building more parking garages is that they may attract yet more non-local traffic to the area, particularly near Metro stations. AREA ELEM ENTS COMPREHENSIVE PLAN DISTRICT ELEMENTS ADOPTED 12/19/06 P. 2-199 (h) The community’s public facilities are experiencing the strains of age and increased demand. While enrollment has fallen at DC Public Schools in other parts of the city, many of the schools in Rock Creek West are over capacity. Some of these schools are experiencing physical deterioration and are in need of modernization. The Tenley-Friendship Library has been closed since December 2004, depriving the community of a vital gathering spot. There continue to be concerns about fire and rescue services, and the difficulties associated with renovating historic fire stations to modern standards. The projected addition of nearly 3,000 households in Rock Creek West by 2025 will likely mean that additional fire and emergency management services may be needed, and that library services may need to be expanded. Some of the recreation centers in the area are also substandard and amenities found in other parts of the city are lacking or are insufficient. The planned new recreation center at Stoddert will provide a much needed facility not only for the community, but for children at Stoddert Elementary i) The character of new development is an issue, particularly as more modest homes are expanded or torn down and replaced with larger homes. While many decry “tear downs” and “mansionization,” others believe the District should not overly restrict the scale or design of new homes. Communities like the Palisades have expressed interest in the “conservation district” concept—preserving neighborhood identity without regulating each detailed aspect of architectural design. Related issues confront the older apartment buildings along Connecticut Avenue and some of the historic estates in the community. These properties may have the capacity for additional development under zoning, but such development could reduce the integrity of the sites or structures and compromise the features that allow them to coexist so well with adjoining single family homes. [PULLQUOTE: The character of new development is an issue, particularly as more modest homes are expanded or torn down and replaced with larger homes. While many decry “mansionization” and “tear downs,” others believe the District should not overly restrict the scale or design of new homes.] (j) The preservation of the natural environment and improvement of environmental health remain top priorities. Like the rest of the city, Rock Creek West includes areas where storm sewers and sanitary sewers are combined, leading to sewage overflow problems during heavy rains. Tree removal and development on steep slopes in areas such as the Palisades and Forest Hills continues to cause 534 erosion, despite tree and slope overlay regulations. Spring Valley continues to contend with the effects of discarded chemicals and munitions from World War I-era weapons testing. Residents in the westernmost part of the Planning Area are concerned about proposed dewatering facilities at Dalecarlia Reservoir, while those in Tenleytown are concerned about the health effects of communication antennas. Residents in Friendship Heights continue to be concerned about emissions and ground pollutants from the WMATA Western Bus Garage. Along major corridors throughout the Planning Area, residents contend with air and noise pollution due to cut-through traffic and idling vehicles k) Aesthetic improvements are needed along some of the area’s roadways so that they can becomethe gracious gateways to the nation’s capital they were intended to be. In other areas, aesthetic qualities are already outstanding, and must be protected from future degradation. This is true on roads traversing national parklands such as Canal Road, Dalecarlia Parkway, and Rock Creek Parkway. [PULLQUOTE: Aesthetic improvements are needed along some of the area’s roadways so that they can becomethe gracious gateways to the nation’s capital they were intended to be. In other areas, aesthetic qualities are already outstanding, and must be protected from future degradation.] (l) There are far fewer community-based residential facilities (CBRFs) in Rock Creek West than other parts of the city. There is no question that the community must share in the social challenges of the city, but the high cost of land and limited availability of sites continues to make this difficult. There is AREA ELEM ENTS COMPREHENSIVE PLAN DISTRICT ELEMENTS ADOPTED 12/19/06 P. 2-200 support in the community for scattering small-scale homeless shelters (which is actively being promoted in churches providing social service facilities on the commercial corridors, and accepting small community residence facilities within single family neighborhoods m) Institutional uses, including private schools, non-profits, large nursing homes, colleges, hospitals, and religious establishments, are part of the fabric of the Rock Creek West community. In fact, they comprise almost 660 acres in the Planning Area, almost one-third of the citywide total. Local institutions provide a resource for local families, and include some of the most architecturally distinctive buildings and attractive settings in the community. Yet many of these facilities have structures that do not conform to the underlying zoning. In some instances, tensions have arisen between institutions and surrounding neighbors due to noise, parking, traffic, and other issues. Pursuant to the District’s zoning regulations, the compatibility of these uses must be maintained, their expansion carefully controlled, and conversion to other non-conforming uses avoided. Solutions to traffic, parking, and other issues must continue to be developed so that the quality of life in surrounding neighborhoods is not diminished. Policies and Actions RCW-1.0 General Policies RCW-1.1 Guiding Growth and Neighborhood Conservation 2308 The following general policies and actions should guide growth and neighborhood conservation decisions in Rock Creek West. These policies and actions should be considered in tandem with those in the citywide elements of the Comprehensive Plan. 2308.1 Policy RCW-1.1.1: Neighborhood Conservation 535 Protect the low density, stable residential neighborhoods west of Rock Creek Park and recognize the contribution they make to the character, economy, and fiscal stability of the District of Columbia. Future development in both residential and commercial areas must be carefully managed to address infrastructure constraints and protect and enhance the existing scale, function, and character of these neighborhoods. 2308.2 Policy RCW-1.1.2: Economic Development Given the strength of the private market within Rock Creek West, generally discourage public sector initiatives that would stimulate additional development in the area. Economic development and growth in this area can be achieved without the leveraging of public dollars that may be needed in other parts of the city. 2308.3 Policy RCW-1.1.3: Conserving Neighborhood Commercial Centers Support and sustain local retail uses and small businesses in the area’s neighborhood commercial centers. These centers should be protected from encroachment by large office buildings and other nonneighborhood serving uses. Compatible new uses such as multi-family housing or limited low-cost neighborhood-serving office space (above local-serving ground-floor retail uses should be considered within the area’s commercial centers to meet affordable housing needs, sustain new neighborhood- serving retail and small businesses, and bring families back to the District 2308.4 [Photo Caption: Neighborhood retail along Connecticut Avenue] AREA ELEM ENTS COMPREHENSIVE PLAN DISTRICT ELEMENTS ADOPTED 12/19/06 P. 2-201 Policy RCW-1.1.4: Infill Development Recognize the opportunity for infill development within the areas designated for commercial land use on the Future Land Use Map. When such development is proposed, work with ANCs, residents, and community organizations to encourage projects that combine housing and commercial uses rather than projects than contain single uses. Heights and densities for such development should be appropriate to the scale and character of adjoining communities. Buffers should be adequate to protect existing residential areas from noise, odors, shadows, and other impacts. 2308.5 Policy RCW-1.1.5: Preference for Local-Serving Retail Support new commercial development in the Planning Area that provides the range of goods and services necessary to meet the needs of local residents. Such uses are preferable to the development of new largerscale or “big-box” retail uses that serve a regional market. “Destination” retail uses are not appropriate in smaller-scale commercial areas, especially those without Metrorail access. Regardless of scale, retail development must be planned and designed to mitigate traffic, parking, and other impacts on adjacent residential areas. 2308.6 Policy RCW-1.1.6: Metro Station Areas Recognize the importance of the area’s five Metrorail stations to the land use pattern and transportation network of Northwest Washington and the entire District of Columbia. Each station should be treated as a unique place and an integral part of the neighborhood around it. The development of large office buildings at the area’s metro stations should be discouraged. The preference is to use available and underutilized sites for housing and retail uses in a manner consistent with the Future Land Use Map, the Generalized Policies Map, and the policies of the Comprehensive Plan. Careful transitions from development along the avenues to nearby low-scale neighborhoods must be provided. 2308.7 536 [Photo Caption: Woodley Park-Zoo/Adams Morgan is one of five Metrorail stations in Rock Creek West] Policy RCW-1.1.7: Housing for Seniors and Disabled Residents Maintain and increase housing for elderly and disabled residents, especially along the major transportation and commercial corridors of Wisconsin and Connecticut Avenues. 2308.8 Policy RCW-1.1.8: Managing Institutional Land Uses Manage institutional land uses in the Rock Creek West Planning Area in a way that ensures that their operations are harmonious with surrounding uses, that expansion is carefully controlled, and that potential adverse effects on neighboring properties are minimized. Ensure that any redevelopment of institutional land is compatible with the physical character of the community and is consistent with all provisions of the Comprehensive Plan and the underlying zoning rules and regulations. Densities and intensities of any future development on such sites should reflect surrounding land uses as well as infrastructure constraints and input from the local community. 2308.9 See the Land Use Element for policies on the expansion of institutional uses and the neighborhood impacts of private schools and other institutional uses. Policy RCW-1.1.9: Protecting Common Open Space Protect the large areas of green space and interior open spaces that are common in and around the community’s institutional uses and its older apartment buildings, such as Cathedral Mansions and the Broadmoor. Where these open spaces are recognized to contribute to the integrity of the site or structure, stringent protection from inappropriate infill shall be maintained. 2308.10 AREA ELEM ENTS COMPREHENSIVE PLAN DISTRICT ELEMENTS ADOPTED 12/19/06 P. 2-202 Policy RCW-1.1.10: Conservation of Historic Estates Conserve the historic estates in the neighborhoods west of Rock Creek Park, including those that are formally landmarked and those that may be eligible for landmark status. Require that the future use of these sites is compatible with their landmark status and protects the integrity of their architectural and landscape design. In the event development does occur, it must be sensitive to surrounding natural areas and adjacent low density residential uses, and not harm historic resources on the site. The use of conservation easements to protect open space on these properties should be considered. 2308.11 Policy RCW-1.1.11: Managing Transportation Demand Improve traffic service levels on the area’s thoroughfares by developing transportation systems management programs, transportation demand management programs and other measures to more efficiently use the area’s road network and reduce the volume of vehicle trips generated by new development. Ensure that new development does not unreasonably degrade traffic conditions, and that traffic calming measures are required to reduce development impacts. This policy is essential to protect and improve the quality of life and the residential character of the area. 2308.12 Policy RCW-1.1.12: Congestion Management Measures Ensure that land use decisions do not exacerbate congestion and parking problems in already congested areas such as the Friendship Heights, Tenleytown, and Connecticut/Van Ness Metro stations. When planned unit developments are proposed in these areas, require traffic studies which identify the mitigation measures that must occur to maintain acceptable transportation service levels—and secure a commitment to implement these measures through transportation management plans. Traffic studies and mitigation plans should consider not only the impacts of the project under consideration but the cumulative impact of other projects which also may impact the community, as well as the impact of 537 nonresident drivers using local streets. Car-sharing, bicycle facilities, and designs which promote transit use should be encouraged as mitigation measures, in addition to measures addressing passenger and service vehicles. 2308.13 [PULLQUOTE: Ensure that land use decisions do not exacerbate congestion and parking problems in already congested areas such as the Friendship Heights, Tenleytown, and Connecticut/Van Ness Metro stations] Please consult the Transportation Element of the Comprehensive Plan for policies on traffic levels of service and transportation demand management programs. Policy RCW-1.1.13: Parking Consider the use of easements with private developers to provide additional public parking in the area’s commercial districts. On-street public parking should not be removed within these districts. 2308.14 Policy RCW-1.1.14: Bicycle Facilities Improve facilities for bicyclists, to the extent feasible and consistent with traffic safety considerations, along Connecticut, Wisconsin, and Massachusetts Avenues, along MacArthur Boulevard, along Calvert Street (to Rock Creek Park and at each of the Metrorail stations. 2308.15 Policy RCW-1.1.15: Metro Access Ensure pedestrian, bicycle, and bus access to the five Metro Station areas, and improve their visual and urban design qualities. Space for car-share vehicles should be provided near the stations where feasible to reduce parking congestion in neighborhoods and encourage car-sharing as an alternative to vehicle ownership. 2308.16 AREA ELEM ENTS COMPREHENSIVE PLAN DISTRICT ELEMENTS ADOPTED 12/19/06 P. 2-203 Action RCW-1.1-A: Commercial Zoning Assessment Conduct an evaluation of commercial zoning designations throughout the Rock Creek West Planning Area. Consider the creation of additional neighborhood commercial overlay zones at the Van Ness/ UDC, Tenleytown, and Friendship Heights Metro stations, and at neighborhood commercial centers and “main streets” throughout the area. Such overlays should ensure that new development is pedestrianoriented, achieves neighborhood compatibility, and is responsive to community concerns about building height, buffers, and transitions between uses. 2308.17 [Photo Caption: Spring Valley Shopping Center] Action RCW-1.1-B: Protection of Neighborhood Architecture and Aesthetics Consider new tools such as Conservation Districts and changes to the Zoning Regulations to reduce the incidence of “teardowns” in Rock Creek West’s single family and row house neighborhoods. While this is a citywide issue (see Policy LU-2.1.6 and Action LU-2.1-D it is a particular concern in this part of the city. 2308.18 Action RCW -1.1-C: Joint Planning Agreement with Montgomery County Develop a joint planning agreement with the Maryland National Capital Park and Planning Commission/ Montgomery County to coordinate the mutual review of projects and area plans on both sides of the District/Maryland line. 2308.19 Action RCW-1.1-D: Traffic Flow Improvements Conduct and regularly update transportation studies for the area’s major corridors to identify possible traffic flow and safety improvements. These studies should also identify improvements to diminish “cutthrough” 538 traffic, reduce speeding, and ensure pedestrian safety on smaller neighborhood side streets, especially in residential areas adjacent to Wisconsin Avenue, Connecticut Avenue, Western Avenue, River Road and Military Road. 2308.20 Action RCW-1.1.-E: Transportation Management Association Consider creation of a Transportation Management Association to provide professional assistance in trip reduction strategies for employers and new residential development in the Wisconsin and Connecticut Avenue corridors, and to develop new programs to reduce parking conflicts. Parking changes such as the extension of meter hours and residential permit parking restriction hours could be considered as part of this effort. 2308.21 RCW-1.2 Conserving and Enhancing Community Resources 2309 Policy RCW-1.2.1: Urban Design Focus Focus urban design efforts in the Rock Creek West Planning Area on its commercial centers and major avenues, historic landmarks, historic districts, and areas with significant environmental and topographical features. 2309.1 See the Urban Design Element for policies on preserving and enhancing architectural character, including guidelines for height, scale, massing, setbacks, and materials. Policy RCW-1.2.2: Scenic Resource Protection Conserve the important scenic and visual resources of Rock Creek West, including a) Views from Fort Reno National Park, which is the highest point of land in the city and a place of historic significance; AREA ELEM ENTS COMPREHENSIVE PLAN DISTRICT ELEMENTS ADOPTED 12/19/06 P. 2-204 (b) The Potomac Palisades, which should be protected as a low density, wooded area above the Potomac River and C&amp;amp;O Canal, with future improvements along the river limited to passive open space, trails, and natural parkland c) Dalecarlia Reservoir, which is environmentally important because of its large land area and proximity to the Potomac River d) The US Naval Observatory Grounds, which contain abundant woodlands, are proximate to parkland, and are vulnerable to light and heat pollution e) Stream valleys, including Rock Creek Park and its tributaries, and Glover Archbold Park (f) Neighborhoods developed on hilly terrain on or near stream valleys such as Barnaby Woods, Forest Hills, Hawthorne, Spring Valley, and Woodland-Normanstone; and (g) The Fort Circle Parks, including Fort Bayard Park, and Whitehaven Parkway. 2309.2 Any future development adjacent to these areas must be designed to respect and maintain their parklike settings, and conserve their environmental quality. 2309.3 [Photo caption: The Norman-style water tower at Fort Reno is located near Tenley Hill, highest point in the District of Columbia.] Policy RCW-1.2.3: National Park Service Areas Conserve and improve the more than 2,000 acres of natural open space in the forested neighborhoods that lie between the Potomac River and Rock Creek Park, including Battery Kemble Park, Glover Archbold Park, the Potomac National Heritage Scenic Area, and the Fort Circle. Support efforts to restore water quality and improve natural habitat, along with capital improvements to improve trails and provide appropriate recreational features. 2309.4 Policy RCW-1.2.4: Cultural and Tourist Attractions Protect and enhance the cultural and visitor attractions west of Rock Creek Park, including the National 539 Cathedral, the C&amp;amp;O Canal, the Capital Crescent Trail, Peirce Mill, the Hillwood Estate, and the National Zoo. Encourage broader recognition of other attractions in the area, such as the Naval Observatory and Fort Circle Parks. Ensure that tourist activity does not disrupt the quality of life for nearby residents by requiring strict adherence to traffic routing, transportation and parking management plans, and reasonable visitation hours. 2309.5 [Photo caption: The National Cathedral is one of the best known cultural and visitor attractions west of Rock Creek Park] Policy RCW-1.2.5: Historic Resources Conserve the important historic resources of the neighborhoods west of Rock Creek, including but not limited to the Glover, Taft, and Ellington bridges; the Washington National Cathedral; mansions such as the Tregaron, Twin Oaks, Cloverdale, and Rosedale Estates, and the Babcock-Macomb House, the Rest, and Owl’s Nest; the Pine Crest/ Greystone/ Klingle Mansion cluster of houses near Rock Creek; the historic districts such as Cleveland Park, Woodley Park, and Grant Road; historic apartment buildings such as the Kennedy-Warren, Cathedral Mansions, the Ponce de Leon, 3901 Connecticut, and Alban Towers; the Chevy Chase arcade and Avalon and Uptown Theaters; the Spring Valley Shopping Center; the sites of significance inventoried in the Historic Resources Survey conducted by the Tenleytown Historical Society, and the National Park System. 2309.6 Policy RCW-1.2.6: Naval Observatory Ensure that planning decisions in the vicinity of the Naval Observatory consider the possible effects of light pollution and take appropriate steps to avoid adverse impacts. 2309.7 AREA ELEM ENTS COMPREHENSIVE PLAN DISTRICT ELEMENTS ADOPTED 12/19/06 P. 2-205 Policy RCW-1.2.7: Fire and EMS Services Renovate and enlarge fire stations while remaining sensitive to their historic architectural qualities and avoiding the loss of adjacent open space. Ensure that there are a sufficient number of fire stations to serve the needs of area residents and businesses.2309.8 Policy RCW-1.2.8: Schools and Libraries Place a very high priority on the renovation and improvement of schools and libraries. The fact that a majority of the schools in this Planning Area are operating at or above capacity should be considered in DCPS facility planning, and in the approval of any residential development that could further exacerbate school overcrowding. Changes to school service boundaries and the development of additional school facilities should be aggressively pursued to ensure that school overcrowding is proactively addressed. 2309.9 Policy RCW-1.2.9: Recreation Centers and Aquatic Facilities Expand recreation grounds where and when feasible, with a particular emphasis on athletic fields for activities such as soccer, softball, and regulation baseball. Expand aquatic facilities to a level of service that is comparable to the level provided in other parts of the District. 2309.10 Policy RCW-1.2.10: Community Based Residential Facilities Encourage the development of small-scale community-based residential facilities on scattered sites within the Planning Area, and social service counseling and referral facilities on the commercial corridors. 540 Additional group homes and community based residential facilities should be accommodated, provided that such facilities are consistent with the area’s low-density character. Local religious institutions should be encouraged to host small shelters to provide for the homeless, taking into consideration issues of liability, security, and adequacy of facilities. 2309.11 See the Environmental Protection Element for additional policies on stream valley parks, limits on impervious surface coverage, expansion of the tree and slope overlay zone, urban forestry, air quality, aircraft noise, and development adjacent to parkland. See the Urban Design Element for policies on conserving natural landform and topography.

Action RCW-1.2-A: Combined Sewer Separation Continue efforts to separate storm sewers and sanitary sewers within the area’s stream valleys, with a priority on the combined sewer in Glover Archbold Park (conveying Foundry Branch 2309.12 Action RCW-1.2-B: Recreation Center and Pools Develop a new recreation center and community pool in the eastern part of the Planning Area. An analysis conducted as part of the District’s 2006 Parks and Recreation Master Plan determined a shortage of such facilities in the Tenleytown/North Cleveland Park/ Forest Hills area and suggested that immediate planning begin to select appropriate sites. 2309.13 Action RCW-1.2-C: Palisades Open Space Protection Protect the historic linear open space that once supported the Palisades/Glen Echo trolley line. 2309.14 [Photo Caption: Palisades gateway signage on MacArthur Boulevard] Action RCW-1.2-D: Senior Center Development Develop an additional senior center in the Rock Creek West Planning Area, in order to improve the delivery of services to the area’s large elderly population. 2309.15 AREA ELEM ENTS COMPREHENSIVE PLAN DISTRICT ELEMENTS ADOPTED 12/19/06 P. 2-206 Action RCW-1.2-E: Tenley-Friendship Library Complete the renovation/ reconstruction of the Tenley-Friendship Library as a community gathering space and repository for books and media serving the surrounding community. 2309.16 Action RCW-1.2-F: Façade Improvements Encourage urban design and façade improvements in the established commercial districts along Wisconsin Avenue and Connecticut Avenue. 2309.17 Action RCW-1.2-G: Spring Valley Remediation Program Continue the public health evaluation for the Spring Valley community and take appropriate follow- up actions to remediate any hazards that are identified. This evaluation is being conducted to determine if residents who live in the vicinity of the former American University Experiment Station have elevated exposure to arsenic or other contaminants. 2309.18 RCW-2.0 Policy Focus Areas 2310 The Comprehensive Plan has identified two areas in Rock Creek West as “policy focus areas,” indicating that they require a level of direction and guidance above that in the prior section of this Area Element and in the citywide elements. These areas are shown in Map 23.1 and are listed in Table 23.2. The policy focus areas include the Connecticut and Wisconsin Avenue corridors. Each corridor is addressed below. 2310.1 [INSERT Map 23.1: Rock Creek West Policy Focus Areas 2310.2] Table 23.2: Policy Focus Areas Within And Adjacent to Rock Creek West 2310.3 Within Rock Creek W est 2.1 Connecticut Avenue Corridor 541 (see p. 23-19) 2.2 Wisconsin Avenue Corridor (see p. 23-22) Adjacent to Rock Creek W est 1 Mount Pleasant Street (see p. 20-27) 2 18 th and Columbia Road (see p. 20-24) 3 Dupont Circle (see p. 21-24) RCW-2.1 Connecticut Avenue Corridor 2311 From the Taft Bridge across Rock Creek, Connecticut Avenue extends 3.5 miles northwest to the Maryland State Line. Along the way, the avenue passes through the Woodley Park, Cleveland Park, and Van Ness/ UDC commercial districts (with Metro stations of the same name at each location as well as the Chevy Chase commercial district at its northern end. The avenue is a broad, attractive boulevard for most of its length, handling over 35,000 vehicles on an average day. The areas between the commercial districts are generally developed with mid- to high-rise apartments and condominiums, although there are AREA ELEM ENTS COMPREHENSIVE PLAN DISTRICT ELEMENTS ADOPTED 12/19/06 P. 2-207 pockets of less dense development as well. In many respects, Connecticut Avenue epitomizes the model of a “great street” that the city seeks to emulate in other parts of the District. 2311.1 [PULLQUOTE: In many respects, Connecticut Avenue epitomizes the model of a “great street” that the city seeks to emulate in other parts of the District] Land use issues vary from one segment of the corridor to the next. The Woodley Park and Cleveland Park segments are historic districts and contain almost no undeveloped land. In Woodley Park, there are ongoing parking and traffic issues relating to the presence of two large hotels with a combined total of over 2,100 rooms. Proposals to convert rooms to condominiums and develop additional units at one of the hotels could generate the need for additional traffic and parking improvements during the coming years. 2311.2 Further north, the Van Ness commercial district includes a multi-neighborhood shopping district (with a supermarket, several national retailers, and smaller businesses office buildings, and several mid- to high-rise residential buildings. Intelsat and the International Chancery Complex are located here. The area also includes the campus of the University of the District of Columbia (UDC enrolling 6,000 students from across the city. 2311.3 While the Van Ness area functions as an important community shopping district, it suffers from a harsh street environment, an excessive amount of hardscaped surfaces, parking problems, a lack of distinctive facades and storefronts, a limited range of retail goods and services, and a loss of ground floor retail space to institutional and school uses. The area does not create the same welcoming appearance that is present in the older commercial districts to the south. The UDC plazas, in particular, could be redesigned to provide a more inviting civic space for students and area residents. 2311.4 Complementary uses such as public art, greenery, and additional local-serving ground floor retail space could help make this center a more attractive gathering place. If and when private redevelopment of older commercial properties is proposed in the vicinity, every effort should be made to achieve more 542 attractive architecture, and a mixing of residential and pedestrian-oriented retail uses rather than further concentration of office space and ground floor institutional/ school space. 2311.5 A Campus Plan for UDC was completed in September 2005 to guide campus growth and development for the next 20 years. As the Plan is implemented, efforts should be made to improve the public space around the Metro station and ensure that any future facility development is compatible with the surrounding neighborhood. 2311.6 Policy RCW-2.1.1: Connecticut Avenue Corridor Sustain the high quality of the Connecticut Avenue corridor. The positive qualities of the corridor, particularly its attractive older apartment buildings, green spaces, trees, and walkable neighborhood shopping districts, should be conserved and enhanced. Continued efforts to improve traffic flow and parking should be pursued, especially in the commercial districts. 2311.7 Policy RCW-2.1.2: Infill Development Recognize the opportunity for additional housing with some retail and limited office space along the Connecticut Avenue corridor. Any development along the corridor should be consistent with the designations of these areas on the Future Land Use Map, zoning overlay requirements, and the scale of adjoining uses. 2311.8 AREA ELEM ENTS COMPREHENSIVE PLAN DISTRICT ELEMENTS ADOPTED 12/19/06 P. 2-208 Policy RCW-2.1.3: Van Ness/ UDC Station Area Improve the design and appearance of the Van Ness/ UDC Station area, particularly the “hardscaped” portion of the UDC Campus. 2311.9 Policy RCW-2.1.4: Coordination Between Community and UDC Support greater coordination and communication between UDC officials and the surrounding community on issues such as parking, traffic, property maintenance, and facility development. Establish complementary goals between the University and the community at large, so that the university becomes even more of a community asset and resource than it is today. 2311.10 Action RCW-2.1-A: Improving the UDC Plazas Work with UDC and with local community groups and the Advisory Neighborhood Commission in the “greening” of public open space on the UDC Campus. 2311.11 Action RCW-2.1-B: Large Hotel Sites Carefully monitor future proposals for the Omni-Shoreham and Marriott Wardman Park hotels to ensure compliance with the Zone regulations and prevent adverse effects on the adjacent residential community. Proactively address ongoing issues at the hotels, such as tour bus and visitor parking. 2311.12 RCW-2.2 Wisconsin Avenue Corridor 2312 Wisconsin Avenue extends north from the Georgetown waterfront approximately 4.5 miles to the Maryland state line. The road pre-dates the 1791 L’Enfant Plan. At one time it was one of the main commercial routes serving the Port of Georgetown and was lined with houses and estates, some of which remain today. Today, the avenue serves as the “Main Street” of several District neighborhoods, including Glover Park, Cathedral Heights, Tenleytown, and Friendship Heights. 2312.1 [PULLQUOTE: Wisconsin Avenue pre-dates the 1791 L’Enfant Plan, and at one time was one of the main commercial routes serving the Port of Georgetown. Today, the avenue serves as the “Main Street” of several District neighborhoods, including Glover Park, Cathedral Heights, Tenleytown, and Friendship Heights.] The current mix of uses along the avenue is eclectic. Its lower portions include pedestrian-oriented shopping, mid- and high-rise apartment buildings, and prominent institutional uses including the Russian 543 Embassy and the National Cathedral. Further north, the avenue passes through relatively low-density single family neighborhoods, with a mix of retail uses, mid-rise office buildings including the national headquarters of Fannie Mae, churches, private schools, and other institutional uses. For several blocks on either side of the Maryland line, the Avenue passes through a regional commercial center at Friendship Heights. The regional center includes large department stores, office buildings, and hotels on both the Maryland and District sides. 2312.2 Most of the planning focus along the corridor has been on the portion of the Avenue north of Van Ness Street, particularly around the Metro stations at Tenleytown and Friendship Heights. During the past five years, land around the two Metro stations has been developing in a manner that is consistent with the previous Comprehensive Plan, with an 8-story residential building now under construction adjacent to the Friendship Heights station (Chase Point) and a new mixed use project combining condominiums and retail uses at the Tenleytown station (Cityline There are other sites similar to Chase Point and Cityline in the vicinity of both stations, and along the mile-long stretch of the avenue in between the stations. Private proposals to redevelop several of these sites are currently under consideration. 2312.3 AREA ELEM ENTS COMPREHENSIVE PLAN DISTRICT ELEMENTS ADOPTED 12/19/06 P. 2-209 This Comprehensive Plan does not propose any significant departure in policy for the Upper Wisconsin Avenue corridor from the previous Comprehensive Plan. As stated in the prior plan, the Tenleytown and Friendship Heights metro stations continue to be opportunity areas for new housing. Friendship Heights continues to be a regional center, and Tenleytown continues to be a multi-neighborhood center, each with limited opportunities for new retail and residential uses. 2312.4 Between Jennifer and Brandywine Streets, there are a number of vacant commercial buildings on the corridor. Their reuse with new local-serving retail uses and housing is encouraged. Additional measures are needed to upgrade the streetscape, improve traffic flow, and address parking problems. Some of these measures are laid out in a traffic study for the Wisconsin Avenue corridor completed in 2005. 2312.5 Friendship Heights and Tenleytown are stable, transit-oriented neighborhoods, and their conservation should be ensured during the coming years. Thus, several core issues must be addressed as plans for any of the sites around the Metro stations or along the corridor move forward. Any redevelopment along the corridor should respect the scale of existing neighborhoods, promote walkability, and create a more attractive street environment. The impact of new development on traffic, parking, infrastructure, and public services must be mitigated to the greatest extent feasible. The scale and height of new development on the corridor should reflect the proximity to single family homes, as well as the avenue’s intended function as the neighborhood’s main street. This means an emphasis on low- to mid-rise mixed use buildings rather than high-rise towers or auto-oriented strip development. 2312.6 [PULLQUOTE: Any redevelopment along the corridor should respect the scale of existing neighborhoods, promote walkability, and create a more attractive street environment. The impact of new development on traffic, parking, infrastructure, and public services must be mitigated to the greatest extent feasible.] Urban design improvements should make the Tenleytown Metro station a more attractive community 544 hub in the future. The low density commercial area on the east side of Wisconsin between Albemarle and Brandywine would specifically benefit from streetscaping and façade improvements. The Metro station entrance located on the east side of Wisconsin Avenue at Albemarle Street is poorly designed and uninviting. Improving the public realm in this location would contribute to the vibrancy of the block as a whole and improve pedestrian safety and comfort. Amenities such as public art, more attractive facades, and street trees should be encouraged. Attention also should be paid to reducing pedestrian-vehicle conflicts along Albemarle Street and ensuring safe pedestrian access to the east side Metro entrance. 2312.7 Policy RCW-2.2.1: Housing Opportunities Recognize the opportunity for additional housing with some retail and limited office space on the east side of Wisconsin Avenue between Albemarle and Brandywine Streets, on the Lord and Taylor parking lot, on the Metro (WMATA) bus garage site west of the Friendship Heights metro station, and on underutilized commercially zoned sites on Wisconsin Avenue. Any development in these areas should be compatible with the existing residential neighborhoods 2312.8 Policy RCW-2.2.2: Tenleytown Metrorail Station Area Stimulate a well-planned economic activity center at the Tenleytown Metrorail station area, generally defined as the area bounded by Albemarle, Brandywine, Fort Drive, and 42nd Street. This center should a) Utilize the public transit infrastructure and maximize Metrorail access b) Enable merchants to upgrade existing businesses, attract new customers and new business establishments, and give residents needed services c) Provide for the development of new housing; AREA ELEM ENTS COMPREHENSIVE PLAN DISTRICT ELEMENTS ADOPTED 12/19/06 P. 2-210 (d) Protect and preserve existing low density residences in the vicinity, and the surrounding institutions and local public facilities from the adverse effects of development; and (e) Maintain heights and densities at appropriate levels, with architectural design that is sensitive to the area's topography relative to the District. 2312.9 Policy RCW-2.2.3: National Cathedral Protect the Washington National Cathedral from development that would despoil its setting or further exacerbate traffic on its perimeter. Ensure that traffic, parking, and activity impacts generated by the Cathedral do not diminish the quality of life in the surrounding neighborhoods. 2312.10 Policy RCW-2.2.4: Wisconsin and Western Avenues Require that any changes to facilitate through-traffic on Wisconsin and Western Avenues include measures to minimize adverse affects on adjacent residential neighborhoods. 2312.11 Policy RCW-2.2.5: Land Use Compatibility Along Wisconsin Avenue Ensure that future development along Wisconsin Avenue is physically compatible with and architecturally sensitive to adjoining residential neighborhoods and is appropriately scaled given the lot depths, widths, and parcel shapes. Use a variety of means to improve the interface between commercial districts and residential uses, such as architectural design, the stepping down of building heights away from the avenue, landscaping and screening, and additional green space improvements. 2312.12 Action RCW-2.2-A: Friendship Heights Task Force Improve inter-jurisdictional cooperation to address transportation issues related to Friendship Heights. Continue the efforts of the Friendship Heights Task Force established in 1998 to review and coordinate land use and transportation decision-making in the Friendship Heights area. 2312.13 [Photo Caption: Friendship Heights] 545 Action RCW-2.2-B: Implement Traffic Signal Improvements From WACTS Implement the recommendations from the 2005 DDOT Wisconsin Avenue Corridor Study regarding traffic light synchronization as well as semi-actuating lights at specific intersections along Wisconsin Avenue. Ensure that signal timing changes do not adversely affect neighborhoods by causing long queues of idling cars on side streets. 2312.14 Action RCW-2.2-C: Zoning and Design Measures Continue to work with the community, the Advisory Neighborhood Commissions, and local property owners to address concerns regarding building density and height, planned unit developments and related density bonuses, and architectural design in the Planning Area. Zoning techniques should be considered to break up the auto-oriented commercial appearance of much of Wisconsin Avenue and instead create a more pedestrian-oriented street, distinct in function and visual character from adjacent residential areas. 2312.15 AREA ELEM ENTS COMPREHENSIVE PLAN DISTRICT ELEMENTS ADOPTED 12/19/06 P. 2-211 CHAPTER 24 UPPER NORTHEAST AREA ELEMENT [ Map facing p 24-1 edited to add “Michigan Park” neighborhood label] Overview 2400 The Upper Northeast Planning Area encompasses 8.7 square miles and includes about two-thirds of the District’s northeastern quadrant. The Planning Area’s western boundary is formed by North Capitol Street (north of Rhode Island Avenue) and the CSX railroad tracks (south of Rhode Island Avenue and its southern boundary is formed by Florida Avenue, Benning Road, and the Anacostia waterfront area. The northern/eastern border is Eastern Avenue at the District of Columbia line. These boundaries are shown in the Map at left. Historically, most of Upper Northeast has been in Council Ward 5. 2400.1 Upper Northeast is principally known as a residential community, with stable single family neighborhoods like Arboretum, Brookland, Woodridge, Queens Chapel, and Michigan Park. It also includes row house neighborhoods like Stronghold and Trinidad, and apartments and higher-density housing in communities like Fort Lincoln, Edgewood, and Carver Terrace. 2400.2 The mix of uses in Upper Northeast is particularly diverse compared to other parts of the city. The Planning Area contains the largest concentration of industrial land uses in the District of Columbia, following the CSX rail lines north and east from Union Station. It includes three major institutions of higher learning—the Catholic University of America (CUA Trinity University, and Gallaudet University—and numerous other institutions serving other missions. It includes two hospitals— Providence and the Hospital for Sick Children. It includes several large federal properties, including the Brentwood Postal Facility. It includes the corporate headquarters of Black Entertainment Television (BET) network, one of the city’s largest night clubs, a Federal Express distribution center, and the nowvacant Hecht’s Warehouse facility. 2400.3 Upper Northeast is also home to the city’s fresh produce district, as well as dozens of small shops and local businesses along neighborhood commercial streets like 12th Street, 18th Street, and Rhode Island Avenue. Historically, the area had many more neighborhood shopping districts like these, but they have declined or in some cases disappeared entirely due to competition from larger auto-oriented and suburban-style shopping centers, including shopping centers in the District of Columbia. 2400.4 The Planning Area is especially well known for its large concentration of religious institutions, including 546 the Basilica of the National Shrine of the Immaculate Conception and the Pope John Paul II Cultural Center. It contains numerous seminaries and ministries, some occupying park-like settings with rolling lawns and historic buildings. The Franciscan Monastery, and the homes of the Josephites, the Carmelites, and many other religious orders are located here. In addition to these historic institutions, the Planning Area also includes portions of the Fort Circle Parks and the historic Langston Golf Course. It is also the gateway to the National Arboretum. 2400.5 [Photo Caption: The area is especially well known for its large concentration of religious institutions, including the Basilica of the National Shrine of the Immaculate Conception.] Several major arterial streets, including New York Avenue, Rhode Island Avenue, South Dakota Avenue, Bladensburg Road, Michigan Avenue, and Riggs Road cross the Planning Area. The Area also includes the Fort Totten, Brookland/CUA and Rhode Island Avenue-Brentwood rail stations, served by Metro’s AREA ELEM ENTS COMPREHENSIVE PLAN DISTRICT ELEMENTS ADOPTED 12/19/06 P. 2-212 Red Line. The Metropolitan Branch Trail is being developed through this area, linking Upper Northeast neighborhoods to Downtown Washington. 2400.6 Upper Northeast neighborhoods are home to many lifelong Washingtonians and have a strong tradition of civic involvement. Civic associations, Advisory Neighborhood Commissions, churches, block clubs and garden clubs are actively involved in discussions about the community’s future. Non-profit organizations such as the North Capitol and Brookland-Edgewood Family Support Collaboratives and the United Planning Organization also play an important role in community life. 2400.7 Upper Northeast shares some of the same challenges facing other parts of the District. The area’s poverty, crime, and unemployment rates are all above the city average. Schools are aging; some are significantly “under-enrolled” and will probably be closed in the coming years. Many parts of the area lack access to open space, parks, and retail services. The area has a large population of seniors, many with special transportation, housing, and health care needs. The Planning Area also faces the challenge of an increasingly unaffordable housing market. A new generation of homeowners has “discovered” Upper Northeast—driving up prices and increasing housing demand. Between 2004 and 2005 alone, the median purchase price of a home in the two ZIP codes that encompass most of the Planning Area (20017 and 20018) increased 45 percent. The greatest future challenge will be to respond to change in a way that keeps Upper Northeast a socially, culturally, economically diverse community. 2400.8 Context History 2401 Upper Northeast began as a series of land grants made by British King Charles I to George Calvert, the first Lord Baltimore. During the 1700s and early 1800s, early settlers enjoyed meadows, woodlands, farms, and open countryside. Tracks for the Baltimore and Ohio (B&amp;amp;O) railroad were laid out in the 1830s, but the area remained sparsely populated until the turn of the 20th Century. In the 1840s, Colonel Brooks, a veteran of the War of 1812, built the Greek Revival mansion that still stands today at 901 Newton Street. Several Civil War strongholds were developed in the area during the 1860s, including Fort Bunker Hill, Fort Slemmer, Fort Totten, and Fort Lincoln. 2401.1 One of the first settlements in the area was Ivy City, developed around 1872 along the B &amp;amp; O 547 Railroad tracks. Ivy City later became a brick-manufacturing center and was home to the National Fair Grounds in the late 1800s. In 1879, the B &amp;amp; O Railroad developed additional rail lines through Upper Northeast, connecting Washington to Pittsburgh, Chicago, and points west. Industrial uses followed the railroads, locating along the sidings. Trolley lines were extended out Rhode Island Avenue in 1897, beginning the area’s residential growth as well as the growth of nearby communities in Maryland. 2401.2 Beginning in the late 1880s, the Brooks estate was subdivided and the Brookland neighborhood was born. The deep lots and spacious porches created the ambiance of small town living just a few miles from central D.C. The houses went for as little as $300 and were affordable for teachers, tradesmen, and government workers. By 1900, the neighborhood boasted plank sidewalks and a streetcar line. Much of the neighborhood’s architectural heritage, including Victorians, bungalows, and colonial homes remains intact today and is part of the neighborhood’s charm. 2401.3 Catholic University was established in the area in 1887. Several other religious organizations settled nearby. The Sisters of Notre Dame de Namur founded Trinity College in 1901, and the Domincans built their House of Studies the same year. The Paulists, the Marists, and Holy Cross Fathers soon followed. By the 1920s, the area had gained the nickname “Little Rome.” By this time, Gallaudet University had AREA ELEM ENTS COMPREHENSIVE PLAN DISTRICT ELEMENTS ADOPTED 12/19/06 P. 2-213 already been flourishing for half a century on a campus near Ivy City, growing from humble beginnings in the 1860s to become the nation’s premier college for the deaf and hearing-impaired. 2401.4 [Photo Caption: Gallaudet University, the nation’s premier college for the deaf and hearing- impaired, has been an important Upper Northeast institution since the 1860s] Much of the Upper Northeast was developed between 1920 and 1950. Major industrial and commercial development occurred during this period, and the rail corridors became as a well-established regional distribution center. New York Avenue became the major route into Washington from the northeast, attracting hotels, motels, and tourist services. Large-scale housing construction took place during the 1920s in Ivy City and Trinidad, and the 1930s saw construction of Langston Dwellings, the nation’s second public housing complex and now a National Historic Landmark. Housing developments like Brentwood Village and Riggs Park were constructed during the 1930s and 40s, and smaller-scale development took place during the 1950s in the Lamond-Riggs and Fort Totten areas. 2401.5 By the 1960s, most of the area was fully developed. Fort Lincoln, the last remaining large tract of vacant land, was conceived as a “New Town” as part of the Johnson Administration’s Great Society program. The 360-acre site was intended to be an innovative experiment in participatory democracy, and racial and economic integration, with residents involved in the community’s development and profits. A private company was selected to build the project, which initially included 550 condominiums, 666 senior citizen apartments and 157 garden apartments. During the 1970s, the National Park Service built a playground and park area, and the city built an elementary school and indoor swimming pool. Only about half of the original plan was actually carried out, however. Most of the remaining acreage at Fort Lincoln is slated for development in the next 10 years, however, so the promise of the initial plans for the community 548 may yet be fulfilled. 2401.6 Land Use 2402 Upper Northeast is made up of approximately 5,640 acres, or about 14 percent of the city’s land area. The composition of uses is shown in Figure 24.1. The area’s land use mix is among the most diverse in the city. 2402.1 [INSERT Figure 24.1:Land Use Composition in Upper Northeast 2402.4] [Pie Chart “slices” adjusted to reflect September 2006 change in Planning Area boundaries.Streets- 22 Commercial-5 Industrial-5 Vacant-2 Public Facilities-3 Institutional-13 Residential- 26 Parks/ Open Space-18 Rail/Utilities-6%] Residential development is the single largest land use, representing about 26 percent of the total area. Of the residential land area, about 44 percent is developed with single family detached homes and about 41 percent with row houses and two-family houses. Apartments make up only about 15 percent of the residential land area. Denser housing is located at Carver Terrace, Montana Terrace, Langston Terrace, Edgewood, Fort Lincoln, and Brentwood. 2402.2 Commercial and industrial uses make up about 10 percent of Upper Northeast’s land area. With the addition of railroads, utilities, and municipal facilities such as salt domes and bus garages, the percentage rises to almost 17 percent of the Planning Area. In fact, Upper Northeast contains almost two-thirds of the city’s industrial acreage. Much of the space consists of warehouse and distribution facilities, light manufacturing, automotive services, and service businesses such as construction suppliers and printers. These uses tend to congregate along New York Avenue, Bladensburg Road, Brentwood Road, Florida Avenue, V Street, and West Virginia Avenue, as well as the area between the Rhode Island and Fort Totten Metro stations, and elsewhere along the heavy rail/ Metro corridor. Commercial uses include AREA ELEM ENTS COMPREHENSIVE PLAN DISTRICT ELEMENTS ADOPTED 12/19/06 P. 2-214 neighborhood-oriented shopping districts and larger shopping centers like the Home Depot/Giant on Brentwood Road, and Hechinger Mall. 2402.3 Institutional land makes up 13 percent of the Planning Area, one of the largest percentages in the city. Most of this total is associated with colleges, universities, and religious institutions. The area also contains more than 1,000 acres of open space, representing 18 percent of its total area. However, much of the open space is actually Mount Olivet and Glenwood Cemeteries—or is located on the far eastern edge of the area within the confines of the National Arboretum. Large parks are generally associated with the Fort Circle chain, and are located on the area’s northern and eastern perimeter. 2402.5 Demographics 2403 The population of Upper Northeast has been falling for the past five decades. In 1990, the area had 68,879 residents. In 2000, this figure dropped 15 percent to 59,394. By 2005, the population had fallen to an estimated 58,500. The decline has been steeper than in the city as a whole, and the area has yet to experience the reversal in decline that has taken place in much of the District. 2403.1 While some of the decline has been due to a drop in household size (from 2.41 persons per household in 1990 to 2.20 persons per household in 2005 there has also been a net loss of households. During the 1990s, the area lost 1,600 households, many in the Ivy City and Trinidad communities. By 2000, 549 these communities had some of the highest rates of abandoned housing stock in the city. Since 2000, the number of households has increased slightly. 2403.2 As indicated in Table 24.1, approximately 87 percent of the area’s residents are African-American, which is significantly higher than the citywide average of 60 percent. Only about 3.0 percent of the area’s residents are of Hispanic origin, and five percent are foreign born. 2403.3 Relative to the city as a whole, the area has a much higher percentage of seniors. More than one in five residents of Upper Northeast is over 65, and the percentage is even higher in neighborhoods like North Michigan Park and Woodridge. Approximately eight percent of the area’s residents reside in group quarters, such as dormitories, seminaries, nursing homes, and community based residential facilities. This is slightly higher than the percentage for the city as a whole, reflecting the large number of institutional uses that are present. 2403.4 Housing Characteristics 2404 More than half of the housing units in Upper Northeast are single family homes. According to the 2000 Census, about 21 percent of the units were single-family detached homes, and 32 percent were row houses and townhomes. Both of these figures exceed than the citywide average. About 18 percent of the units are in duplexes, triplexes, and fourplexes, also higher than the citywide average. Conversely, only 8.3 percent of the area’s housing stock consists of multi-family buildings of 50 units or more, compared to 23 percent in the city as a whole. 2404.1 [Photo Caption: More than half of the housing units in Upper Northeast are single family homes] The 2000 Census also reported that the number of renter households and the number of owner households in Upper Northeast was about equal. Much of Upper Northeast consists of stable, well-established housing stock with relatively low turnover. In 2000, almost 60 percent of the population had been living in their homes for five years or longer, significantly higher than the citywide average of 47 percent. 2404.2 AREA ELEM ENTS COMPREHENSIVE PLAN DISTRICT ELEMENTS ADOPTED 12/19/06 P. 2-215 Table 24.1: Upper Northeast at a Glance 2403.5 Basic Statistics Land Area (square miles) 8.8 Population 1990 68,879 2000 59,394 2005 (estimated) 58,500 2025 (projected) 70,000 Households (2005 24,400 Household Population (2005 exclu des grou p qu arters 53,700 Persons Per Household (2005 2.20 Jobs (2005 39,000 Density (persons per sq mile 2005 6,700 Year 2000 Census Data Profile Upper Northeast Planning Area Citywide Total of Total of Total Age Under 18 12,411 20.9 20.0 18-65 36,440 61.3 67.8 Over 65 10,543 17.8 12.2 Residents Below Poverty Level 11,564 19.5 20.2 Racial Composition White 5,316 9.0 30.4 Black 51,705 87.1 60.3 Native American 202 0.3 0.3 Asian/ Pacific Islander 496 0.8 2.6 Other 845 1.4 2.8 Multi-Racial 830 1.4 5.2 Hispanic Origin 1,769 3.0 2.9 550 Foreign-Born Residents 2,998 5.0 5.1 Tenure Owner Households 11,501 48.4 40.7 Renter Households 12,240 51.6 59.3 Population 5+ yrs in same house in 2000 as in 1995 32,775 58.4 59.0 Housing Occupancy Occupied Units 23,741 88.4 90.4 Vacant Units 3,111 11.6 9.6 Housing by Unit Type 1-unit detached 5,506 20.5 13.1 1-unit attached 8,483 31.6 26.4 2-4 units 4,845 18.0 11.0 5-9 units 1,902 7.1 8.0 10-19 units 3,001 11.2 10.3 20-49 units 851 3.2 7.4 50+ units 2,239 8.3 23.3 Mobile/ other 25 0.1 0.2 Figures noted with an asterisk are estimates developed by the Office of Planning and the Department of Employment Services based on a variety of data sources Total population of subcategories may not match 2000 Census totals due to sampling errors. AREA ELEM ENTS COMPREHENSIVE PLAN DISTRICT ELEMENTS ADOPTED 12/19/06 P. 2-216 Income and Employment 2405 According to the 2000 Census, median household income in Upper Northeast was $36,453, compared to a citywide median of $45,927. Approximately 19 percent of the area’s residents lived below the federal poverty level. This is an increase from 1990, when the figure was 15.1 percent. 2405.1 Data from the Department of Employment Services and the Office of Planning indicates that Upper Northeast had 39,000jobs in 2005, primarily in institutional uses and in the production, distribution, and repair sector. This represents 5.2 percent of the city’s job base. On the surface, the Planning Area appears to have an excellent balance between jobs and households, with about 1.5 jobs per household. However, most of the jobs are held by non-District residents, and most of the residents in Upper Northeast work elsewhere. Based on 2000 Census data, about 54 percent of the Planning Area’s jobs are filled by Maryland residents and about 12 percent are filled by Virginia residents. Only 8 percent are filled by residents of Upper Northeast. 2405.2 The 2000 Census found that about 31 percent of the residents of Upper Northeast worked in Central Washington and about 39 percent worked elsewhere within the District of Columbia. About 30 percent commuted to the suburbs. 2405.3 Projections 2406 Based on an analysis of approved development, available land, regional growth trends, and local planning policies, the population decline experienced in Upper Northeast since the 1950s has come to an end. In fact, the Planning Area is projected to add approximately 5,000 households by 2025, and its population is projected to rise about 19 percent to 70,000. The primary areas of population growth are around the Metro stations at Fort Totten, Brookland, and Rhode Island Avenue; at Fort Lincoln; and in the vicinity of Hechniger Mall/ Benning Road. 2406.1 [PULLQUOTE: Based on an analysis of approved development, available land, regional growth trends, and local planning policies, the population decline experienced in Upper Northeast since the 1950s has come to an end. In fact, the Planning Area is projected to add approximately 5,000 households by 2025, and its population is projected to rise about 19 percent to 70,000.] More than half of the additional households are associated with specific sites that are in various stages of 551 planning right now. These include the remaining vacant parcels at the Fort Lincoln New Town, WMATA-owned land at the three metro stations, and private development projects such as the 500- unit Arboretum Place north of Hechinger Mall. 2406.2 The number of jobs is expected to increase by about 15 percent over the next 20 years. Most of the increase is associated with redevelopment of key parcels along the New York Avenue and Bladensburg corridors, and mixed use development around the Metro stations. Expansion of industrially zoned acreage in the area is not expected. In fact, most of the employment growth will be the result of the conversion of former industrial land to new uses, especially near Metro. 2406.3 AREA ELEM ENTS COMPREHENSIVE PLAN DISTRICT ELEMENTS ADOPTED 12/19/06 P. 2-217 Planning and Development Priorities 2407 Workshops over the course of the Comprehensive Plan Revision provided an opportunity for residents of Upper Northeast to share their views on important planning issues. Input from these workshops was supplemented with feedback from Advisory Neighborhood Commissioners, community groups, and individual residents. Many other meetings have been held on long-range planning issues in the Upper Northeast Planning area, including workshops for the Northeast Gateway Small Area Plan; Ward 5 “summits” on transportation and economic development; transportation meetings on the Rhode Island Avenue, New York Avenue, and South Dakota Avenue corridors; and meetings on specific development proposals. 2407.1 Several important messages and priorities were expressed at these meetings: 2407.2 (a) Upper Northeast neighborhoods take pride in their stability as middle-class, family-oriented communities. Although the community’s population declined by 20 percent during the 1980s and 1990s, there is still a strong sense of identity and civic pride in places like Arboretum, North Michigan Park, and Woodridge. Conservation of the existing housing stock is a high priority—although there are differences of opinion on the best way to achieve this. Neighborhoods such as Brookland, where about two- thirds of the homes pre-date World War II, have debated the possibility of historic district designation but have yet to reach a consensus on the best way to preserve the historic character of the community b) Residents of Upper Northeast are feeling the pressure of escalating housing costs. Displacement is a concern in neighborhoods like Ivy City and Trinidad, where one-quarter of the residents live below the poverty line and home prices have tripled in the last five years. Upper Northeast includes many lower income households, residents on public assistance, and hard working people trapped in low wage jobs. There is anxiety about expiring federal housing subsidies, and the future of large assisted housing complexes like Langston Dwellings. Residents want assurance that they will not be dislocated if and when these complexes are renovated or replaced. The recent redevelopment of Montana Terrace provides a good example of meeting affordable housing needs while creating opportunities for home ownership and stability for existing residents. [PULLQUOTE: Residents of Upper Northeast are feeling the pressure of escalating housing costs. Displacement is a concern in neighborhoods like Ivy City and Trinidad, where one-quarter of the residents live below the poverty line and home prices have tripled in the last five years.] (c) Residents are concerned that they are the location of choice for “unwanted” municipal land uses, such as trash transfer stations, bus garages, youth detention centers, vehicle maintenance facilities, and 552 halfway houses. While there is an appreciation for the importance of these uses to the city, there are concerns about their continued concentration in Upper Northeast simply because the area has a large supply of industrially zoned land d) Upper Northeast neighborhoods have lived with the heavy truck traffic, noise, and visual blight that comes with industrial land uses for decades. This is particularly true in Ivy City, Langdon, Brentwood, and the 7th-8th Street NE area southwest of the Brookland Metro station. Residents are especially concerned about large trucks, vibration, dust, air pollution, and the transport of hazardous materials on the railroads. There is also a desire to clean up “brownfields” sites in the community and return them to productive use. These sites provide an opportunity to apply “green” development principles, turning environmental liabilities into environmental assets. AREA ELEM ENTS COMPREHENSIVE PLAN DISTRICT ELEMENTS ADOPTED 12/19/06 P. 2-218 (e) Retail choices in Upper Northeast need to be expanded. For 20 years, Hechinger Mall was the only large shopping center in the area. Options have improved with the opening of Home Depot/ Giant, and will get better still with a planned new shopping center at Fort Lincoln, but these centers are autooriented and are not convenient to everyone in the community. Many of the commercial areas in Upper Northeast are dominated by used car lots, carry-outs, liquor stores, automotive uses and other activities that are not conducive to neighborhood shopping. More retail districts like Brookland’s 12th Street are desired to meet the day-to-day needs of residents. Rhode Island Avenue, Benning Road, Florida Avenue, Bladensburg Road, and the areas around the Metro stations have the potential to become pedestrianoriented shopping districts. The Florida Market also has the potential to become a more vital shopping district, serving not only as a wholesale venue but also as a retail center for Ivy City, Trinidad, Eckington, and nearby neighborhoods. [Photo Caption: 12th Street NE retail district in Brookland] (f) Although seminaries, cemeteries, and institutions provide much greenery, and the community is ringed by the National Arboretum, the Anacostia River, and the Fort Circle Parks, much of Upper Northeast is starved for public parkland. More active recreational areas, playgrounds, athletic fields, and traditional neighborhood parks are needed. Better connections to the Arboretum and Anacostia River are needed. There are also concerns that the large institutional open spaces—particularly the great lawns and wooded glades of the area’s religious orders—may someday be lost to development. These properties are important to the health of the community and should be considered as opportunities for new neighborhood and community parks (as well as housing) if they become available. They are the “lungs” of the neighborhood g) The area’s major thoroughfares need to be improved. New York Avenue is the gateway to the Nation’s capital for over 100,000 vehicles a day and provides the first impression of Upper Northeast (and the District of Columbia) for many residents, commuters, and visitors. Its motels and fast food joints, used car lots, chop shops, strip clubs, salvage yards, and warehouses do not project a positive image. Moreover, the street is often clogged with traffic, especially around its interchanges with South Dakota Avenue and Florida Avenue. The same is true of Bladensburg Road, and some of the other arterial streets in the area. The community wishes to see these corridors upgraded, without diverting traffic to other thoroughfares and residential streets nearby h) Upper Northeast did not experience the kind of large-scale development experienced elsewhere in the city between 2000 and 2005, but that is likely to change in the next few years. Proposals to redevelop 553 the Capital City Market as a “new town” are being discussed, and a large mixed use development is also under consideration at the Bladensburg/ New York Avenue intersection. Residents are also very interested in proposals for the McMillan Reservoir Sand Filtration Site and the Armed Forces Retirement Home, as development on these sites would challenge the roads, infrastructure, and public services in Upper Northeast. Growth and development must be carefully managed to avoid negative impacts, and should be leveraged to provide benefits for the community wherever possible i) There is general—though not universal—agreement that the Rhode Island Avenue, Brookland/CUA, and Fort Totten Metrorail stations are logical locations for future development. The stations are currently adjoined by parking lots and industrial uses that do not take advantage of their proximity to Metro. These areas may provide opportunities for apartments, condominiums, townhomes, and other types of moderate and medium density housing, provided that measures are taken to buffer adjacent lower density neighborhoods, address parking and traffic issues, and mitigate other community concerns. There are differences of opinion as to the appropriate density of development and the precise mix of uses at each station. Small Area Plans are needed for each area to continue the community dialogue on their future. AREA ELEM ENTS COMPREHENSIVE PLAN DISTRICT ELEMENTS ADOPTED 12/19/06 P. 2-219 (j) More should be done to connect Upper Northeast residents with jobs in the Planning Area. Right now, only 10 percent of those who live in Upper Northeast actually work in Upper Northeast. With 40,000 jobs in the community, that figure should be much higher. The area’s 9 percent unemployment rate is unacceptably high. Trade schools, vocational schools, and apprenticeship programs are needed to strengthen labor force skills and provide more pathways to employment for local residents. [PULLQUOTE: More should be done to connect Upper Northeast residents with jobs in the Planning Area. Right now, only 10 percent of those who live in Upper Northeast actually work in Upper Northeast.] (k) Schools and other public facilities in Upper Northeast should be retained in public ownership, even if they are closed due to “underenrollment.” Residents attending Comprehensive Plan meetings felt strongly that these facilities should not be sold for development, but should be kept in public ownership and used for the delivery of other community services, such as health care and senior care. The need for senior services is particularly high, given the high percentage of seniors (over 25 percent of the population in neighborhoods like Woodridge and North Michigan Park Many of the schools, libraries, recreation centers, and other public facilities in the area are in need of modernization. Crummell School is a particularly troubling example. The modernization of Noyes Elementary and Luke Moore Academy are promising, but there is much more to accomplish. [Photo Caption: Noyes Elementary] Policies and Actions UNE-1.0 General Policies UNE-1.1 Guiding Growth and Neighborhood Conservation 2408 The following general policies and actions should guide growth and neighborhood conservation decisions in Upper Northeast. These policies and actions should be considered in tandem with those in the citywide elements of the Comprehensive Plan. 2408.1 554 Policy UNE-1.1.1: Neighborhood Conservation Protect and enhance the stable neighborhoods of Upper Northeast, such as Michigan Park, North Michigan Park, University Heights, Woodridge, Brookland, Queens Chapel, South Central, Lamond Riggs, and Arboretum. The residential character of these areas shall be conserved, and places of historic significance, gateways, parks, and special places shall be enhanced. 2408.2 Policy UNE-1.1.2: Compatible Infill Encourage compatible residential infill development throughout Upper Northeast neighborhoods, especially in Brentwood, Ivy City, and Trinidad, where numerous scattered vacant residentially- zoned properties exist. Such development should be consistent with the designations on the Future Land Use Map. New and rehabilitated housing in these areas should meet the needs of a diverse community that includes renters and owners; seniors, young adults, and families; and persons of low and very low income as well as those of moderate and higher incomes. 2408.3 AREA ELEM ENTS COMPREHENSIVE PLAN DISTRICT ELEMENTS ADOPTED 12/19/06 P. 2-220 Policy UNE-1.1.3: Metro Station Development Capitalize on the presence of the Metro stations at Rhode Island Avenue, Brookland/CUA, and Fort Totten, to provide new transit-oriented housing, community services, and jobs. New development around each of these three stations is strongly supported. The District will coordinate with WMATA to ensure that the design, density, and type of housing or other proposed development at these stations is compatible with surrounding neighborhoods; respects community concerns and feedback; serves a variety of household incomes; and mitigates impacts on parking, traffic, and public services. Development shall comply with other provisions of the Comprehensive Plan regarding the compatibility of new land uses with established development, the provision of appropriate open space, and mitigation of impacts on traffic, parking, and public services. 2408.4 Policy UNE-1.1.4: Reinvestment in Assisted Housing Continue to reinvest in Upper Northeast’s publicly-assisted housing stock. As public housing complexes are modernized or reconstructed, actions should be taken to minimize displacement and to create homeownership opportunities for current residents. 2408.5 Policy UNE-1.1.5: Vacant and Abandoned Structures Reduce the number of vacant, abandoned, and boarded up structures in Upper Northeast, particularly in the Ivy City and Trinidad areas. 2408.6 Policy UNE-1.1.6: Neighborhood Shopping Improve neighborhood shopping areas throughout Upper Northeast. Continue to enhance 12th Street NE in Brookland as a walkable neighborhood shopping street and encourage similar pedestrian-oriented retail development along Rhode Island Avenue, Bladensburg Road, South Dakota Avenue, West Virginia Avenue, Florida Avenue, and Benning Road. New pedestrian-oriented retail activity also should be encouraged around the area’s Metro stations. 2408.7 [Photo caption: Capital City Market] Policy UNE-1.1.7: Larger-Scale Retail Development Encourage additional community-serving retail development at the existing Brentwood Shopping Center (Home Depot-Giant the Rhode Island Avenue Shopping Center (4th and Rhode Island NE and Hechinger Mall. Encourage new large-scale retail development at Fort Lincoln. Design such development to complement, rather than compete with, the neighborhood-oriented business districts 555 in the area. 2408.8 Policy UNE-1.1.8: Untapped Economic Development Potential Recognize the significant potential of the area’s commercially and industrially-zoned lands, particularly along the New York Avenue corridor, V Street NE, and Bladensburg Road, and around the Capital City Market, to generate jobs, provide new shopping opportunities, enhance existing businesses, create new business ownership opportunities, and promote the vitality and economic well-being of the Upper Northeast community. The uses, height, and bulk permitted under the existing M and CM-1 zones are expected to remain for the foreseeable future. 2408.9 Policy UNE-1.1.9: Production, Distribution, and Repair Uses Retain the existing concentration of production, distribution, and repair (PDR) uses in Upper Northeast, but encourage the upgrading of these uses through higher design standards, landscaping, and improved screening and buffering. Emphasize new uses, including retail and office space, that create jobs for Upper Northeast area residents, and that minimize off-site impacts on the surrounding residential areas. 2408.10 AREA ELEM ENTS COMPREHENSIVE PLAN DISTRICT ELEMENTS ADOPTED 12/19/06 P. 2-221 Policy UNE-1.1.10: High Impact Industrial Uses Strongly discourage the further proliferation of junkyards, scrap yards, and other high impact industrial uses within the area, since these activities do not enhance the quality of life in either the city as a whole or the surrounding residential areas of Upper Northeast. Take appropriate action to reduce the potential for these uses to encroach into established residential and commercial areas within Upper Northeast, and to address environmental health and safety issues for employees and for those who live or work nearby. 2408.11 Policy UNE-1.1.11: Buffering Improve the interface between residential neighborhoods, industrial/commercial areas, and the railroad and Metro rail lines. Protect neighborhoods such as Gateway, South Central, Ivy City, North Michigan Park, and Brentwood from noise, truck traffic, commuter traffic, odor and compromised infrastructure; and take steps to reduce the damaging effects of excessive noise and vibration from Metrorail and commercial train traffic for homes along the CSX and Metro lines in Brookland, Queens Chapel, North Michigan Park, Brentwood and Gateway. 2408.12 Policy UNE-1.1.12: Truck Traffic Continue to work with the community and area businesses to reduce heavy truck traffic on residential streets, particularly along W Street, West Virginia Avenue, Taylor Street NE, and 8th Street NE. Assess the circulation needs of businesses in these areas to determine if there are alternate means of access that would reduce impacts on adjacent neighborhoods. 2408.13 Action UNE-1.1-A: Industrial/Residential Buffers Develop additional solutions to buffer residential and industrial areas from one another. One possibility is to consider extending the Langdon Overlay (L-O) zone, which prohibits certain types of industrial uses in immediate proximity to residential uses and which requires screening to protect residential areas. 556 Other approaches to buffering, such as design guidelines, also should be considered. 2408.14 [Photo Caption: CSX Rail corridor] Action UNE-1.1-B: Industrial Land Use Study Implement the applicable recommendations of the 2006 Industrial Land Use Study for Upper Northeast (see the Land Use and Economic Development Elements for a description of this Study 2408.15 Action UNE-1.1-C: Traffic Safety Improvements Improve traffic safety throughout the Upper Northeast area, particularly along Eastern Avenue, Franklin Street, Monroe Street, Brentwood Road, Bladensburg Road, Rhode Island Avenue, South Dakota Avenue, and New York Avenue. 2408.16 UNE-1.2 Conserving and Enhancing Community Resources 2409 Policy UNE-1.2.1: Streetscape Improvements Improve the visual quality of streets in Upper Northeast, especially along North Capitol Street, Rhode Island Avenue, Bladensburg Road, Eastern Avenue, Michigan Avenue, Maryland Avenue, Florida Avenue, and Benning Road. Landscaping, street tree planting, street lighting, and other improvements should make these streets more attractive community gateways. 2409.1 Policy UNE-1.2.2: Protecting Local Historic Resources Protect historic resources in Upper Northeast, including Gallaudet University, the Brooks Mansion, Crummell School, the homes of Ralph Bunche and Samuel Gompers, the Franciscan Monastery, AREA ELEM ENTS COMPREHENSIVE PLAN DISTRICT ELEMENTS ADOPTED 12/19/06 P. 2-222 Langston Terrace housing project, Langston Golf Course, the Hospital for Sick Children, Glenwood Cemetery, and the Fort Circle Parks. 2409.2 [Photo Caption: Brooks Mansion] Policy UNE-1.2.3: Highlighting Local Cultural Resources Develop new means to highlight the historic and cultural resources in Upper Northeast, such as improved signage and trails connecting the Fort Circle Parks, organized tours of the area’s religious landmarks, and tours of historic homes in Brookland and other parts of the community. 2409.3 Policy UNE-1.2.4: Linking Residents to Jobs Improve linkages between residents and jobs within Upper Northeast so that more of the area’s 40,000 working age adults fill the approximately 40,000 jobs located within the Planning Area. Achieve this linkage by developing additional vocational and trade schools within Upper Northeast, encouraging apprenticeships and internships, and creating new partnerships between the area’s major employers, the District, the public and charter schools, local churches, and major institutions. 2409.4 Policy UNE-1.2.5: Increasing Economic Opportunity Create new opportunities for small, local, and minority businesses within the Planning Area, and additional community equity investment opportunities as development takes place along New York Avenue, Bladensburg Road, Benning Road, and around the Metro stations. 2409.5 Policy UNE-1.2.6: Connecting to the River Recognize the Anacostia River and the land along its banks as an essential and integral part of the Upper Northeast community. Improve the connections between Upper Northeast neighborhoods and the Anacostia River through trail, path, transit, and road improvements, and improved access to the National Arboretum. Provide amenities and facilities in the planned waterfront parks that meet the needs of Upper Northeast residents. 2409.6 [PULLQUOTE: Recognize the Anacostia River and the land along its banks as an essential and integral part of the Upper Northeast community. Improve the connections between Upper Northeast neighborhoods and the Anacostia River through trail, path, transit, and road improvements, and 557 improved access to the National Arboretum.] Policy UNE-1.2.7: Institutional Open Space Recognize the particular importance of institutional open space to the character of Upper Northeast, particularly in and around Brookland and Woodridge. In the event that large institutional uses are redeveloped in the future, pursue opportunities to dedicate substantial areas as new neighborhood parks and open spaces. Connections between Upper Northeast open spaces and the network of open space between McMillan Reservoir and Fort Totten also should be pursued. 2409.7 See also Land Use Element policy LU-2.3.7, Section LU-3.2, and the Park and Open Space Element (Section PROS-4) for policies on institutional uses Policy UNE-1.2.8: Environmental Quality Improve environmental quality in Upper Northeast, with particular attention given to the reduction of emissions and particulates from trucks and industrial uses in the area. 2409.8 AREA ELEM ENTS COMPREHENSIVE PLAN DISTRICT ELEMENTS ADOPTED 12/19/06 P. 2-223 Action UNE-1.2-A: Parkland Acquisition Address the shortage of parkland in the Planning Area, placing a priority on the areas with the most severe deficiencies. According to the 2006 Parks and Recreation Master Plan, these areas include Edgewood, Ivy City, the Carver/Langston area, and the southwest part of Brookland. 2409.9 Action UNE-1.2-B: Hazardous Materials Transport Continue to lobby for restrictions on the transport of hazardous cargo through the Upper Northeast Planning Area, particularly on the rail lines which abut the community’s residential neighborhoods. 2409.10 Action UNE-1.2-C: Main Streets/Great Streets Consider the designation of additional commercial areas as DC Main Streets, including the Woodridge shopping area along Rhode Island Avenue, and portions of Bladensburg Road. Consider adding Rhode Island Avenue to the city’s “Great Streets” program, making it eligible for funding for transportation, streetscape, and façade improvements. 2409.1 UNE-2.0 Policy Focus Areas 2410 This Area Element includes more detailed policy direction for seven specific areas (see Map 24.1 and Table 24.2 Each area requires direction and guidance beyond that provided by the citywide elements and the earlier part of this Area Element.

They benefit from proximity to amenities like the Langston Golf Course, the National Arboretum, and the new Metro station at New York Avenue. However, the community also suffers the effects of concentrated poverty, a poor image, and perceptions of neglect. Some residents perceive their neighborhood as a “dumping ground” for undesirable land uses. Today, they ask for the same quality public services and facilities that other residents of the District receive. 2411.2 The Capital City Market (also known as the Union Terminal market or the Florida Avenue Market) is one of the most notable and unique features of the Northeast Gateway area. The market was initially constructed to house businesses displaced from Downtown Washington because of federal building AREA ELEM ENTS COMPREHENSIVE PLAN DISTRICT ELEMENTS ADOPTED 12/19/06 P. 2-225 expansions. Today it continues to offer one-stop shopping for wholesalers and restaurant suppliers, selling goods ranging from produce, meats, seeds, and seafood to ethnic specialty foods. While the Market is a one-of-a-kind institution, it has been plagued by code violations and traffic circulation and congestion, environmental, and safety issues. 2411.3 In 2005, the District completed a revitalization strategy for the Northeast Gateway to address key planning and development issues. The Strategy addressed five key issues: housing revitalization, commercial revitalization, human capital, public facilities, and community image/ public realm. It identified four key areas for revitalization, including Bladensburg Road, the Montana/New York/ Bladensburg Triangle, the central part of Ivy City, and the Capital City Market. 2411.4 [Photo Caption: Row houses in Ivy City] Policy UNE-2.1.1: Ivy City Infill Development Support the development of additional infill housing in Ivy City, including “loft style” and live-work housing that blends with the industrial character of the neighborhood. Rehabilitation and renovation of the existing housing stock also should be strongly encouraged. 2411.5 Policy UNE-2.1.2: Capital City Market Redevelop the Capital City Market into a regional destination that may include residential, dining, entertainment, office, hotel, and wholesale food uses. The wholesale market and the adjacent DC Farmers Market are important but undervalued amenities that should be preserved, upgraded, and more effectively marketed 2411.6 Policy UNE-2.1.3: Consolidating DC Government Operations Make more efficient use of the DC government owned properties in the Northeast Gateway area, including the DC Housing Authority Motor Pool site and the DC school bus parking lot, and the DC Vehicle Maintenance complex. Avoid the further concentration of human service and transportation facilities in this area, and improve buffering between these uses and nearby residential areas. 2411.7 Policy UNE-2.1.4: Northeast Gateway Urban Design Improvements 559 Improve the image and appearance of the Northeast Gateway area by creating landscaped gateways into the community, creating new parks and open spaces, upgrading key streets as specified in the Northeast Gateway Revitalization Strategy, and improving conditions for pedestrians along Florida Avenue and other neighborhood streets. 2411.8 Action UNE-2.1-A: Capital City Market Develop and implement plans for the revitalization and development of the Capital City Market into a mixed use residential and commercial destination.

The road is an important community gateway, providing access to the National Arboretum and residential neighborhoods in Upper Northeast, as well as a commuter route for suburban communities in Prince Georges County. The road contains two distinct segments: the “lower” portion (addressed here) is south of New York Avenue. The “upper” portion (addressed in Section 2.4) is north of New York Avenue and is part of the South Central/Gateway and Fort Lincoln neighborhoods. 2412.1 Hechinger Mall anchors the lower end of the Bladensburg corridor. The Mall was developed in 1982, in part to help bring retail back to Northeast DC following the demise of H Street NE after the 1968 riots. At one time, the 190,000 square foot Mall had one of the largest stores in the Hechinger chain, but today it serves as a community shopping center anchored by a supermarket, a pharmacy, and several national discount retailers. The adjacent area includes the western end of Benning Road, which is included in the city’s “Great Streets” program. 2412.2 The area immediately to the east includes the Langston Terrace and Carver Terrace public housing projects, historic Langston Golf Course, and the “Schools on the Hill” campus comprised of Spingarn Senior High School, Brown Junior High School, and Charles Young Elementary. The area has played an important role in the history of the District’s African-American community. Langston Terrace Dwellings was the District’s first public housing complex and was designed by renowned African American 560 architect Hilyard Robinson. When it opened in 1938, prospective residents had to be gainfully employed African American residents with children. Langston Golf Course shares a similar history; when it opened in 1939, it was the only golf course in the city open to African Americans. The nearby 42-acre Schools on the Hill Campus provides a particularly attractive academic setting above the Anacostia River, and is one of the largest complexes of public school buildings in the city. 2412.3 [Photo Caption: Hechinger Mall anchors the lower end of the Bladensburg corridor] The Hechinger/Benning area is expected to undergo significant change during the next 20 years, driven in part by the revival of northeast Capitol Hill, the H Street corridor, and the Anacostia Waterfront area. Some 500 units of housing are planned at Arboretum Place just north of Hechinger Mall. The Mall itself offers long-term opportunities for redevelopment as a more pedestrian-friendly and urban mixed use center, with additional square footage and possibly new uses such as housing. Pedestrian-oriented retail storefronts along Bladensburg Road hold the potential for revival and restoration. Langston Terrace has been suggested as a possible “new community” site, raising the possibility of infill development and new mixed income housing around the complex. The 42-acre Schools on the Hill campus also has been considered as the showpiece for a “city of learning” initiative (Hilltop Career Academies with new educational facilities, mixed use development, and services that are integrated with the adjacent neighborhood. 2412.4 [PULLQUOTE: The Hechinger/Benning area is expected to undergo significant change during the next 20 years, driven in part by the revival of northeast Capitol Hill, the H Street corridor, and the Anacostia Waterfront area.] Policy UNE-2.2.1: Mixed Use Development Along Benning and Bladensburg AREA ELEM ENTS COMPREHENSIVE PLAN DISTRICT ELEMENTS ADOPTED 12/19/06 P. 2-227 Improve the overall appearance of Benning and Bladensburg Roads in the vicinity of Hechinger Mall.

On the north, the corridor abuts the Brentwood and Langdon communities. On the south, it abuts Ivy City and the National Arboretum. In 2001, the Brentwood neighborhood gained notoriety as the site of the US postal sorting facility where anthrax-contaminated mail addressed to two members of the U.S. Senate was handled. Two postal workers died from anthrax exposure, and the 633,000-square foot facility was closed for more than two years. Other large uses in the area include a Metrorail maintenance facility, the Ivy City railyards, the WMATA Bladensburg Bus Division, and the 725,000 square foot art-deco Hecht’s warehouse. New AREA ELEM ENTS COMPREHENSIVE PLAN DISTRICT ELEMENTS ADOPTED 12/19/06 P. 2-228 York Avenue itself is lined by strip commercial uses such as hotels, fast food restaurants, and gas stations. 2413.1 The corridor faces land use, transportation, and urban design challenges. Some of the industrial uses are considered obsolete by today’s s market standards and are being considered for new uses such as retail development. Tall pole-mounted signs create a cluttered and unattractive image and poorly designed intersections create traffic hazards. New York Avenue itself is carrying far more traffic than it was designed to handle. 2413.2 [PULLQUOTE: The New York Avenue corridor faces land use, transportation, and urban design challenges. Some of the industrial uses are considered obsolete by today’s market standards and are being considered for new uses such as retail development.] In 2005, the District’s Department of Transportation completed a multi-modal corridor study for New York Avenue and presented a number of recommendations for consideration. These included adding a tunnel from I-395 to 1st Street NE, building a “signature” bridge across Florida Avenue, reconstructing the Brentwood Avenue bridge, adding a traffic circle at Montana Avenue, and adding a grade- separated traffic circle at Bladensburg Road (through traffic on New York Avenue would pass beneath the circle 562 The recommendations also include widening the road and adding a landscaped median and turning lanes in selected areas, a linear park on the road’s north side, and significantly upgrading the corridor’s appearance from Bladensburg Road to South Dakota Avenue. The Corridor study included land use recommendations for key sites along New York Avenue, and also recommended architectural guidelines to reinforce the street edge. 2413.3 Additional land use recommendations for the New York Avenue industrial area are contained in an Industrial Land Use Study commissioned by the Office of Planning in 2005. These include strengthening and enhancing light industrial (production, distribution and repair) activities along the north side of the avenue between Montana and South Dakota Avenues, retaining the area’s municipal-industrial functions (bus garages, road maintenance facilities, etc and considering a transition to other uses (such as retail) on strategic sites. 2413.4 [Photo caption: Hecht’s Department Store Warehouse on New York Avenue] Policy UNE-2.3.1: New York Avenue Corridor Improve the appearance of New York Avenue as a gateway to the District of Columbia. Support road design changes, streetscape improvements, and new land uses that improve traffic flow and enhance the road’s operation as a multi-modal corridor that meets both regional and local needs. 2413.5 Policy UNE-2.3.2: Production, Distribution, and Repair Land Uses Retain a significant concentration of production, distribution, and repair (PDR) land uses in the New York Avenue corridor. While the conversion of industrial land to other uses can be considered on key sites, including the Bladensburg/Montana/New York “triangle,” these changes should not diminish the area’s ability to function as an industrial district meeting the needs of government and District businesses and residents. Retail and office uses have existed historically along both sides of V Street between Bladensburg Road and South Dakota Avenue NE and should continue in accordance with the existing CM- and M- zoning. 2413.6 AREA ELEM ENTS COMPREHENSIVE PLAN DISTRICT ELEMENTS ADOPTED 12/19/06 P. 2-229 Policy UNE-2.3.3: Infill Development Support infill development and redevelopment on underutilized commercial sites along New York Avenue. Particularly encourage large-format destination retail development that would provide better access to goods and services for residents, and sales tax dollars for the District. 2413.7 Policy UNE-2.3.4: Consolidate and Formalize Auto-Related Uses Use zoning, enforcement, and other regulatory mechanisms to reduce the number of illegal auto- related activities on Bladensburg Road. Consistent with the Northeast Gateway Plan, create a more attractive environment for the car dealerships and automotive businesses along Bladensburg Road, possibly including the development of an “auto mall.” 2413.8 Action UNE-2.3-A: New York Avenue Traffic Study Refine the road design recommendations contained in the 2005 New York Avenue Corridor Study and identify capital improvements to carry out these recommendations. A high priority should be given to the redesign of the intersections at Montana Avenue and Bladensburg Road. 2413.9 Action UNE-2.3-B: Brentwood Road Improvements Implement the recommendations of the Brentwood Road Transportation Study, intended to improve traffic flow, address parking issues, upgrade transit, and provide new pedestrian and bicycle facilities along Brentwood Road. 2413.10 Action UNE-2.3-C: Hecht’s Warehouse 563 Encourage the reuse of the historic Hecht’s warehouse building as an incubator for technology- oriented uses, creative industries, and other activities which help grow the District’s “knowledge economy.” 2413.11 Action UNE-2.3-D: Business Improvement District Consider the creation of a Business Improvement District (BID) serving the New York Avenue corridor. 2413.12 UNE-2.4 Upper Bladensburg Road and Fort Lincoln 2414 The Upper Bladensburg corridor has suffered from disinvestment for many years. Although it continues to support some neighborhood retail activity, it is dominated by automotive repair shops, auto parts shops, car lots, and vacant businesses. 2414.1 [PULLQUOTE: The Upper Bladensburg corridor has suffered from disinvestment for many years. Although it continues to support some neighborhood retail activity, it is dominated by automotive repair shops, auto parts shops, car lots, and vacant businesses.] The opportunity to improve Upper Bladensburg Road is tied to plans for Fort Lincoln, which is located northeast of the Bladensburg/ South Dakota Avenue intersection. Plans to build out the remaining vacant land at Fort Lincoln are now moving forward, with more than 200 three- and four-bedroom townhomes already under construction. Additional townhomes, a shopping center, and offices or distribution facilities should follow in the coming years. The increased population presents an opportunity to revitalize the adjacent Bladensburg corridor, and bring back some of the neighborhood-oriented shopping that disappeared from the corridor years ago. 2414.2 AREA ELEM ENTS COMPREHENSIVE PLAN DISTRICT ELEMENTS ADOPTED 12/19/06 P. 2-230 Policy UNE-2.4.1: Fort Lincoln New Town Support the continued development of Fort Lincoln New Town consistent with approved plans for the site.

The Rhode Island Avenue-Brentwood Metro station opened in 1976 and was one of the first stations in the system. Despite the fact that the station is just one mile from 564 Downtown DC, its current configuration has a suburban feel. The station is adjoined by one of the largest surface parking lots in the District of Columbia on its southeast, and by an aging shopping center on the northwest. Other uses in the vicinity include the new “big box” retail center on Brentwood Road, light industrial uses, and strip commercial uses on Rhode Island Avenue. 2415.1 Land around the Rhode Island Avenue Metro station is underutilized and does not provide the community focal point it could. The WMATA parking lot presents the most immediate and obvious opportunity for redevelopment, but over time additional properties may transition to new uses. Medium to high density housing is strongly encouraged in this area, and traffic improvements are recommended to make the station more accessible for pedestrians, bicyclists, and transit users. Improvements to the Metropolitan Branch Trail are planned through this area. 2415.2 Extending east from the station, Rhode Island Avenue is a wide tree-lined street with well kept homes and apartments, scattered commercial businesses and churches, and public uses like fire stations and parks. A walkable shopping District between 20th and 24th Streets NE serves as the retail heart of the Woodridge community. 2415.3 The general character of the Avenue is not expected to change significantly over the next 20 years, but there are opportunities for moderate density infill development in several locations. Filling in “gaps” in the street wall would be desirable in the commercial areas, creating a more pedestrian-friendly environment. While most of the street is zoned for commercial uses, development that includes ground floor retail uses and upper story housing would be desirable. The surrounding area is under-served by retail uses and would benefit from new restaurants, local-serving stores, and other services. 2415.4 [Photo caption: Metrorail near Rhode Island Avenue] AREA ELEM ENTS COMPREHENSIVE PLAN DISTRICT ELEMENTS ADOPTED 12/19/06 P. 2-231 Policy UNE-2.5.1: Rhode Island Avenue/ Brentwood Metro Station Encourage the development of additional medium-to high-density mixed use development around the Rhode Island Avenue Metro station, particularly on the surface parking lots in the station vicinity. 2415.5 Policy UNE-2.5.2: Redevelopment of Older Commercial and Industrial Sites Encourage the long-term reuse of older commercial and industrial sites in the Rhode Island Avenue Metro station vicinity with higher-value mixed uses, including housing. Future mixed-use development should be pedestrian-oriented, with design features that encourage walking to the Metro station and nearby shopping. 2415.6 Policy UNE-2.5.3: Pedestrian Improvements Enhance pedestrian connections between the neighborhoods around the Rhode Island Avenue Metro station and the station itself. This should include improvements to the “public realm” along Rhode Island Avenue, with safer pedestrian crossings, street trees, and other amenities that make the street more attractive. 2415.7 Policy UNE-2.5.4: Rhode Island Avenue Corridor Strengthen the Rhode Island Avenue corridor from 13th to 24th Street NE as a pedestrian-oriented mixed use district that better meets the needs of residents in the Brentwood, Brookland, Woodridge, and South 565 Central neighborhoods. Infill development that combines ground floor retail and upper-story office and/or housing should be encouraged. 2415.8 Action UNE-2.5-A: Rhode Island Avenue Station Area Planning Work with WMATA, the local Advisory Neighborhood Commission, local businesses, and the community to ensure that plans for the Rhode Island Avenue Metrorail parking area enhance the surrounding neighborhoods and address issues such as traffic, parking, and station access. 2415.9 UNE-2.6 Brookland/CUA Metro Station Area 2416 The Brookland/Catholic University of America (CUA) Metrorail Station is located between the Brookland commercial district (12th Street NE) on the east and the Catholic University/ Trinity University campuses on the west. The station is abutted by low-density residential uses on the east, and a mix of light industrial, commercial, and institutional uses on the north, south, and west. Despite the presence of the Metro station, much of the vacant land in the station vicinity is zoned for industrial uses. Major property owners include WMATA and Catholic University. 2416.1 The Office of Planning is scheduled to conduct a comprehensive study of the area surrounding the Metro station during 2006 and 2007, including an assessment of land use and zoning, the retail environment, transit/traffic safety, urban design, cultural tourism, and heritage development. The goal of the study is to guide future development in the station vicinity in a manner that respects the low density scale of the nearby residential area (particularly the area along 10th St NE and east of 10th Street NE mitigates parking and traffic impacts, and improves connections to nearby institutions and shopping areas. 2416.2 [Photo caption: Brookland Metro Station] Policy UNE-2.6.1: Brookland/CUA Metro Station Area Encourage moderate-density mixed use development on vacant and underutilized property in the vicinity of the Brookland/ CUA Metro station, including the parking lot east of the station.

Consistent with the 2006 Industrial Land Use Study, the industrially zoned area within ¼ mile of the Metro station may be considered appropriate for long-term transition to more intense uses, including housing, live- work lofts, artists studios, and similar uses. 2416.5 Action UNE-2.6-A: Brookland Metro Small Area Plan Prepare a Small Area Plan for the Brookland Metro station area to provide guidance on the future use of vacant land, buffering of existing development, upgrading of pedestrian connections to Catholic University and 12th Street, urban design and transportation improvements, and the provision of 566 additional open space and community facilities in the area. Ensure that community partners such as Catholic University and CSX are involved in this process. 2416.6 UNE 2.7 Fort Totten Metro Station Area 2417 The Fort Totten Station is served by the Metrorail Green and Red Lines. As the transfer point between two intersecting lines, the station area has strategic importance in plans for the District’s growth. Presently, Fort Totten is adjoined by large surface parking lots, industrial uses, and garden apartments. New residential development is taking place east of the station, and several conceptual development projects are under study. The station itself sits within the boundary of the Fort Circle Parks. Fort Totten Park, immediately west of the station, is an important DC historic site and contains the remnants of one of the most important civil-war fortifications in the Fort Circle chain. 2417.1 [PULLQUOTE: The Fort Totten Station is served by the Metrorail Green and Red Lines. As the transfer point between two intersecting lines, the station area has strategic importance in plans for the District’s growth.] The large parcels owned by WMATA—located on the east and west sides of the station—present an opportunity for transit-oriented mixed use development. A strong emphasis should be placed on housing and local-serving retail uses on these sites, with an orientation to the station and connecting bus lines. Zoning in the area already permits medium density mixed use development, and the area has been slated for transit-oriented development in the Comprehensive Plan for more than 20 years. 2417.2 The “Y-intersection” of Riggs Road and South Dakota Avenue is located about one-quarter mile northeast of the station. The Department of Transportation is currently redesigning the intersection to improve traffic flow, enhance conditions for pedestrians, and make more efficient use of the very large right- ofway. The intersection is currently missing basic amenities like sidewalks, curb cuts, and pedestrian signals, making it difficult to navigate on foot. These improvements are being coordinated with redevelopment planning for adjacent commercial and residential uses along Riggs Road, including the Riggs Plaza Shopping Center between 3rd Street NE and Chillum Place. 2417.3 [Photo Caption: Fort Totten Metrorail Station] AREA ELEM ENTS COMPREHENSIVE PLAN DISTRICT ELEMENTS ADOPTED 12/19/06 P. 2-233 Policy UNE-2.7.1: Fort Totten Metro Station Encourage the reuse of WMATA-owned land and other underutilized property in the immediate vicinity of the Fort Totten Metrorail station, focusing on the area bounded by the Fort Circle Parks on the west and south, Riggs Road on the north, and South Dakota Avenue on the east. This area is envisioned as a “transit village” combining medium-density housing, ground floor retail, local-serving office space, new parkland and civic uses, and structured parking. Redevelopment should occur in a way that protects the lower density residences in the nearby Manor South, Michigan Park, and Queens Chapel neighborhoods, and addresses traffic congestion and other development impacts. 2417.4 Policy UNE-2.7.2: Traffic Patterns and Pedestrian Safety Improve pedestrian access to the Fort Totten Metrorail Station, with a particular emphasis on pedestrian and vehicle safety improvements at the South Dakota/Riggs intersection. 2417.5 567 Policy UNE-2.7.3: Municipal-Industrial Uses Retain the established municipal-industrial land uses located to the south of the Fort Totten station (including the Trash Transfer Station on the west side of the station and salt dome on the east side Guide future development in the vicinity of these activities in a way that does not impede their ability to function. 2417.6 Action UNE-2.7-A: Fort Totten Small Area Plan Prepare an updated study of the Fort Totten/ Riggs Road area to more precisely determine the mix of desired land uses; and to address transportation, parking, open space, urban design, and other issues related to the area’s future development. The study area for the Small Area Plan should include Riggs Plaza and the adjacent Riggs/South Dakota intersection. 2417.7 Action UNE-2.7-B: Riggs Road/South Dakota Avenue Redesign Reconstruct the intersection at Riggs Road and South Dakota Avenue to improve pedestrian and vehicular safety. Consider opportunities for new development, parkland, and community facilities on the excess right-of-way. 2417.8 AREA ELEM ENTS COMPREHENSIVE PLAN DISTRICT ELEMENTS ADOPTED 12/19/06 P. 2-234 This page left intentionally blank IMPLEMENTATION COM PREHENSIVE PLAN D ISTRICT ELEM ENTS *ADOPTED 12/19/06 P. 3-1 CHAPTER 25 IMPLEMENTATION Overview 2500 The Implementation Element describes how the policies and actions in the Comprehensive Plan should be carried out. The Element provides recommendations on improving the long-range planning process, enhancing links between the Comprehensive Plan and the Capital Improvement Plan, reporting on Comprehensive Plan progress, and updating and amending the Comprehensive Plan in the future. It also identifies recommended Comprehensive Plan actions with links to Zoning regulations, to highlight the need for changes to ensure that “zoning is not inconsistent with the Comprehensive Plan” as required by the DC Code. 2500.1 This Element is divided into three sections Administration of the Planning Process Strengthening Linkages to Capital Programming and Zoning; and Monitoring, Evaluating, and Updating the Comprehensive Plan 2500.2 The Implementation Element also includes an “Action Planning” Table (Table 25.1) summarizing all actions in the Comprehensive Plan. All of the actions listed in Table 25.1 are excerpted from Chapters 1- 24 of the Plan and the reader is advised to consult the relevant chapter for more information and additional context for each action listed. 2500.3 IM-1.0 Administration of the Planning Process 2501 This section of the Implementation Element addresses the manner in which land use planning policies are interpreted and applied on a day-to-day basis. This includes the development review, small area planning, zoning, long-range planning, and community involvement activities that are used to carry out Comprehensive Plan policies. These policies effectively define “standard operating procedures” for planning administration in the District of Columbia. 2501.1 IM-1.1 Development Review 2502 The development review process provides one of the most effective means of carrying out 568 Comprehensive Plan policies. Projects requiring review by staff, the Board of Zoning Adjustment, and the Zoning Commission may be tied to findings of consistency with the Comprehensive Plan, or at least to evaluations that consider relevant Comprehensive Plan policies. Development review also provides a means of evaluating the impacts of major projects on public services and the natural environment, and assessing the compatibility of proposed design with adjacent uses and neighborhood character. The latter assessment is particularly important in historic districts, where review by the Historic Preservation Review Board also may be required. 2502.1 Of course, not all projects are subject to review. Much of the city’s development is permitted as a matterof- right under existing zoning, affording few opportunities for the Office of Planning to determine Comprehensive Plan consistency. In the future, methods of increasing the scrutiny of matter-of-right projects may be needed, particularly with respect to urban design and environmental impacts. This could include adjustments to the thresholds for projects requiring “Large Tract Review”, implementation of a IMPLEMENTATION COM PREHENSIVE PLAN D ISTRICT ELEM ENTS *ADOPTED 12/19/06 P. 3-2 Site Plan Review process, changes to the city’s Environmental Impact Screening Forms, and additional standards to ensure that development sufficiently mitigates its effects on traffic, parking, infrastructure, and public service needs. 2502.2 Review and modifications to the Planned Unit Development (PUD) process and regulations are also needed. PUDs were originally conceived as a way to develop large tracts of land more creatively than was allowed by matter-of-right zoning. Creative design has been further incentivized through the granting of additional building height and density by the Zoning Commission in exchange for public benefits such as affordable housing and open space. The Zoning Regulations establish minimum lot area standards for PUDs, ranging from two acres in low- and moderate-density residential districts to 15,000 square feet in high-density and commercial zoning districts, with provisions for reductions to these standards included in the Regulations. Public benefits are generally provided on-site, but may also be provided in the surrounding area, subject to specific provisions set forth by zoning. 2502.3 While this process allows for significant public input and often results in superior design and amenities, it has been criticized in some parts of the city. Throughout the Comprehensive Plan revision process, concerns were expressed about the location and extent of public benefit amenities, the level of additional density that may be granted, and a perceived lack of predictability. As the District sets out to revise its Zoning Regulations, careful evaluation of the PUD thresholds, standards, and waiver conditions is recommended. 2502.4 Policy IM-1.1.1: Mitigation of Development Impacts To the greatest extent feasible, use the development review process to ensure that impacts on neighborhood stability, traffic, parking and environmental quality are assessed and adequately mitigated. 2502.5 Policy IM-1.1.2: Review of Development in Surrounding Communities Increase the District’s participation in the review of development projects located in neighboring jurisdictions along the District’s boundaries in order to promote land use compatibility and more 569 effectively address traffic and parking issues. 2502.6 Policy IM-1.1.3: Relating Development to Infrastructure Capacity Ensure that development does not exceed the capacity of infrastructure. Land use decisions should balance the need to accommodate growth and development with available transportation capacity, including transit and other travel modes as well as streets and highways, and the availability of water, sewer, drainage, solid waste, and other public services. 2502.7 Policy IM-1.1.4: Incentives for Achieving Goals and Policies Allow the use of zoning incentives such as increased height and density in appropriate locations as a tool for achieving Comprehensive Plan goals and policies. 2502.8 Policy IM-1.1.5: Development Approvals and the Comprehensive Plan To the extent they are relevant, consider the goals and policies of the District Elements in the approval of planned unit developments, variances, campus plans, special exceptions, large tract reviews, and other projects requiring review. 2502.9 Policy IM-1.1.6: Studies Preceding Zoning Case Approvals Ensure that zoning case approvals such as Planned Unit Developments (PUDs) utilize 1) transportation and infrastructure studies and recommended conditions of approval to mitigate potential impacts 2) agreements for financing any necessary improvements, including public and private responsibilities 3) IMPLEMENTATION COM PREHENSIVE PLAN D ISTRICT ELEM ENTS *ADOPTED 12/19/06 P. 3-3 agreements to comply with “first source employment” requirements and other regulations that ensure public benefits to District residents. 2502.10 Policy IM-1.1.7: Housing as a PUD Amenity Consider the provision of on-site housing for low and moderate income households, seniors, and persons with special needs as an important amenity in Planned Unit Developments. 2502.11 Policy IM-1.1.8: Location of PUD Amenities Require that a substantial part of the amenities proposed in Planned Unit Developments (PUDs) shall accrue to the community in which the PUD would have an impact. 2502.12 Action IM-1.1-A: PUD Regulations Complete an evaluation of the District’s Planned Unit Development (PUD) regulations and procedures, including a “Best Practices” assessment of PUD practices in other large cities. The evaluation should consider minimum size thresholds, appropriate allowances for bonus height and density, the types of public benefits that may be provided, and review and approval procedures. The evaluation should also consider much stricter limitations on the extension of PUD approvals. 2502.13 Action IM-1.1-B: Large Tract Review Complete an evaluation of the District’s Large Tract Review procedures, including a “Best Practices” assessment of large tract procedures in other large cities. The evaluation should determine if the existing threshold of 50,000 square feet for commercial projects and three acres for residential projects is appropriate, and should include provisions to preclude projects from being broken into phases as a way to circumvent the review process. 2502.14 IM-1.2 Small Area Planning 2503 Small Area Plans cover defined geographic areas that require more focused direction than can be provided by the Comprehensive Plan. The intent of such plans is to guide long-range development, stabilize and improve neighborhoods, achieve citywide goals, and attain economic and community benefits. The Comprehensive Plan Area Elements identify where Small Area Plans should be prepared, with an emphasis on the Land Use Change Areas, Enhancement Areas, and business districts shown on the Comprehensive Plan’s Generalized Policies Map. As these Small Area Plans are completed, future amendments to the Comprehensive Plan should identify subsequent generations of small area plans. 570 ANC and public involvement in the development of Small Area Plans is desired and expected. 2503.1 Policy IM-1.2.1: Small Area Plans Prepare Small Area Plans and other planning studies for parts of the city where detailed direction or standards are needed to guide land use, transportation, urban design, and other future physical planning decisions. The focus should be on areas that offer opportunities for new residential, commercial, and mixed use development, or areas with problems or characteristics requiring place-specific planning actions. Use the Comprehensive Plan Area Elements, the Generalized Policies Map, and land use monitoring activities to identify areas in the city where such plans are needed. Citizens shall have the right to petition or suggest small area plans to be proposed by the Mayor. 2503.2 Policy IM-1.2.2: Protocol for Small Area Plans Ensure that Small Area Plans take a form appropriate to the needs of the community and reflect citywide needs, District and neighborhood economic development policies and priorities, market conditions, implementation requirements, competing demands, available staffing resources and time, and available funding. Such plans should address such topics as neighborhood revitalization and conservation needs and strategies, aesthetic and public space improvements, circulation improvements and transportation IMPLEMENTATION COM PREHENSIVE PLAN D ISTRICT ELEM ENTS *ADOPTED 12/19/06 P. 3-4 management, capital improvement requirements and financing strategies, the need for zoning changes or special zoning requirements, and other implementation techniques necessary to achieve plan objectives. Small area plans should be adopted by the Council and used to supplement the Comprehensive Plan. If necessary, Comprehensive Plan amendments should be introduced to ensure internal consistency for the areas involved. 2503.3 Please consult the Area Elements of the Comprehensive Plan for actions relating to the locations of future Small Area Plans. IM-1.3 Zoning Regulations and Consistency 2504 The importance of zoning as a tool for implementing the Comprehensive Plan, particularly the Future Land Use Map, is discussed in several places in the Comprehensive Plan. The Home Rule Charter requires that zoning “shall not be inconsistent” with the Comprehensive Plan. Consequently, revisions to the Comprehensive Plan should be followed by revisions to the Zone Map, with an emphasis on removing clear inconsistencies. 2504.1 However, the zoning impact of the District Elements of the Comprehensive Plan is broad, and is not limited to areas where Comprehensive Plan/ Zone Map inconsistencies are present. Additional zoning map amendments may be needed to achieve neighborhood revitalization or conservation goals. The Zoning Regulations themselves need substantial revision and reorganization, ranging from new definitions to updated development and design standards, and even new zones. A major revision to the Zoning Regulations is planned for 2007-2009. Action items throughout the Comprehensive Plan have been listed for consideration during this effort, eventually enabling zoning to work more effectively as a Comprehensive Plan implementation tool. Table 25-1 highlights all zoning-related actions that are included in the Comprehensive Plan. 2504.2 Policy IM-1.3.1: Updating Land Use Controls Regularly review and update the District’s land use controls and building codes to eliminate obsolete regulations and develop new regulations that address emerging issues, land uses, building types, and technologies. 2504.3 Policy IM-1.3.2: Zone Map Consistency 571 Consistent with the Home Rule Charter, ensure that the Zone Map is not inconsistent with the Comprehensive Plan Future Land Use Map. Make appropriate revisions to the Zone Map to improve its alignment with the Future Land Use Map and to eliminate clear inconsistencies. 2504.4 Policy IM-1.3.3: Consultation of Comprehensive Plan in Zoning Decisions Require the Board of Zoning Adjustment, the Zoning Commission, the Zoning Administrator, and other District agencies or decision-making bodies regulating land use to look to the District Elements of the Comprehensive Plan and its accompanying Maps. Decisions on requests for rezoning shall be guided by the Future Land Use Map read in conjunction with the text of the Plan (Citywide and Area Elements) as well as Small Area Plans pertaining to the area proposed for rezoning. 2504.5 Policy IM-1.3.4: Interpretation of the District Elements Recognize the overlapping nature of the Comprehensive Plan elements as they are interpreted and applied. An element may be tempered by one or more of the other elements. As noted at Section 300.2, since the Land Use Element integrates the policies of all other District elements, it should be given greater weight than the other elements. IMPLEMENTATION COM PREHENSIVE PLAN D ISTRICT ELEM ENTS *ADOPTED 12/19/06 P. 3-5 Policy IM-1.3.5: District Government Compliance Ensure continued compliance by the government of the District of Columbia with the provisions and standards of its building and zoning regulations in all parts of the city. Action IM-1.3-A: Zone Map Revision Undertake a comprehensive revision to the District’s Zone Map to eliminate inconsistencies between zoning and the Comprehensive Plan Future Land Use Map and other Comprehensive Plan Maps, including those showing historic districts. 2504.6 Action IM-1.3-B: Comprehensive Plan Zoning Correspondence Table Prepare and publish general guidelines which indicate which zone districts are “clearly consistent”, “potentially consistent”, and “clearly inconsistent” with each Comprehensive Plan Land Use Category. 2504.7 Action IM-1.3-C: Review of Definitions Review the definitions used in planning, zoning, building, and housing codes to determine if changes are needed to establish consistency between District agencies. 2504.8 Action IM-1.3-D: Adoption of Future Land Use Map and Policy Map Adopt the Future Land Use Map and Policy Map by “Act.” Any inconsistencies in land use map designations between the illustration on the map and the textual description of the map designation that is contained in the adopted Comprehensive Plan legislation shall be resolved in favor of the text. 2504.9 IM-1.4 Long-Range Planning 2505 A healthy long-range planning function is essential to implement and maintain the Comprehensive Plan, monitor its effectiveness, and collect and analyze data to guide land use decisions. Other sections of the Comprehensive Plan speak to the importance of using long-range planning to guide the capital improvement process, public facilities plans, and transportation, housing, and economic development efforts. Good plans must be based on good data; their success should be measurable through quantifiable benchmarks. Part of the function of long-range planning is to ensure that such benchmarks are realistic 572 and are based on accurate sources, research, and analysis. 2505.1 Another key function of long-range planning is to advocate on the District’s behalf at the regional level. Successful implementation of the Comprehensive Plan will require additional collaboration with adjacent state, county, and city governments; and additional regional planning initiatives. The District must be more than a passive bystander in these initiatives. It should lead the way in discussions about regional housing, transportation, social, and environmental issues. It should advocate for greater equity at the regional level, stronger measures to balance jobs and housing across the region, and transit improvements which improve regional mobility, environmental quality and reduce urban sprawl. 2505.2 Policy IM-1.4.1: Long-Range Planning Program Using the recommendations including in Section IM-3.0 of this Comprehensive Plan, establish an ongoing planning process that provides for updating and amending the Comprehensive Plan, periodic progress reports, and collection and dissemination of long-range planning data. 2505.3 Policy IM-1.4.2: Monitoring Neighborhood Trends Monitor social, economic, community, and real estate trends that might require land use actions or policy modifications. Ensure that current, reliable data is incorporated in the city’s land use planning efforts and that such data is consistently used across District agencies. 2505.4 IMPLEMENTATION COM PREHENSIVE PLAN D ISTRICT ELEM ENTS *ADOPTED 12/19/06 P. 3-6 Policy IM-1.4.3: Regional Planning Actively participate in regional land use planning initiatives, and recognize the link between these initiatives and broader District goals relating to housing, transportation, economic growth, social equity, and environmental quality. Encourage jurisdictions across the region to do their part to meet regional housing demand for persons of all incomes, accommodate special needs populations, contribute to transportation improvements, and make land use and transportation decisions which support “smart growth”. 2505.5 Action IM-1.4-A: Progress Reports At least once every two years, prepare a Comprehensive Plan Progress Report for the Council that documents the progress being made on implementation of the District Elements. 2505.6 IM-1.5 Public Input 2507 The District of Columbia is committed to public involvement in local government affairs, particularly those relating to land use decisions. The District has one of the most extensive networks of citizen and civic organizations, neighborhood organizations, advocacy groups and special interest groups in the country. Its 37 Advisory Neighborhood Commissions (ANCs) provide a unique forum for seeking local input and expressing priorities on a range of land use issues. The Zoning Commission, Board of Zoning Adjustment, and the Council itself provide formalized opportunities for public discourse on land use matters. The advent of the Internet, e-mail, streaming video, and other technologies have made information instantly accessible to thousands of residents, enabling unprecedented levels of participation in community meetings, summits, and forums. 2507.1 There is presently considerable interest in expanding input even further through the creation of a city Planning Commission. A 2003 Assessment of the Comprehensive Plan concluded that the merits of a Planning Commission should be evaluated, in part to improve Comprehensive Plan implementation and accountability. This dialogue has continued to evolve over the past three years. Several options for the Commission’s composition and responsibilities have been proposed; these will be given further consideration after the Comprehensive Plan is adopted. 2507.2 573 Policy IM-1.5.1: Involvement of Advisory Neighborhood Commissions Include the Advisory Neighborhood Commissions and area residents in the review of development to assist the District in responding to resident concerns. Consistent with the statutory requirements of the DC Code, feedback from the ANCs should be given “great weight” as land use recommendations and decisions are made. 2507.3 Policy IM-1.5.2: Promoting Community Involvement Encourage the community to take a more proactive role in planning and development review, and to be involved in Comprehensive Plan development, amendment, and implementation. A variety of means should be used to secure community input, including advisory and technical committees, community workshops, review of draft texts, public forums and hearings, and other means of discussion and communication. 2507.4 Policy IM-1.5.3: Faith Institutions Recognize the importance of faith institutions to neighborhood life in the District, including their role as neighborhood centers, social service providers, and community anchors. Work collaboratively with local faith institutions in neighborhood planning and development initiatives, both to address community needs and to reach residents who might not otherwise participate in local planning initiatives. 2507.5 IMPLEMENTATION COM PREHENSIVE PLAN D ISTRICT ELEM ENTS *ADOPTED 12/19/06 P. 3-7 Policy IM-1.5.4: Transparency in Decision-Making Strongly encourage transparent decision making in all land use and development matters, making information available and accessible to residents and maintaining open lines of communication with the public as plans are developed. 2507.6 Policy IM-1.5.5: Electronic Media Enhance communication between residents, organizations, and the District by providing access to information through electronic media and other methods. 2507.7 Action IM-1.5-A: Planning Publications Prepare a set of easy-to-understand written and electronic guides to help residents navigate the planning and building processes, comprehend land use planning and zoning regulations, and follow the standards, procedures, and expectations used in local planning activities. 2507.8 Action IM-1.5-B: Planning Commission Feasibility Study Consistent with the recommendations of the Comprehensive Plan Assessment of 2003, conduct a Mayorally-commissioned study of the feasibility of creating a Planning Commission in the District of Columbia. The report shall be prepared by outside parties and submitted to the Mayor, the Council, and the public within 120 days of the effective date of the Comprehensive Plan Amendment Act of 2006 The report shall summarize potential models for such a Commission, including its composition, roles, responsibilities, authority, staffing, and relationship to the City Council and other city commissions. 2507.9 IM-2.0 Strengthening the Linkages to Capital Programming and Zoning 2508 This section addresses the need to strengthen the links between the Comprehensive Plan and the capital improvement and zoning processes. 2508.1 IM-2.1 Link to Capital Improvement Planning 2509 A capital improvement plan (CIP) is a multi-year plan identifying capital projects to be funded during the planning period. Capital improvement planning provides one of the most important means to establish the Comprehensive Plan as the guiding document for future public investments. The CIP provides government 574 with a process for the planning and budgeting of capital needs. It answers such questions as what to buy, build, or repair and when to buy or build it. The basic function of a CIP is to provide a formal mechanism for decision-making, a link to the Comprehensive Plan, and a financial management tool for setting priorities for capital projects. 2509.1 Most communities prepare a five- or six-year CIP. In general, only projects over a certain cost threshold and with a useful life of many years qualify for CIP funding. The CIP is generally organized around major program categories such as Parks and Recreation; Transportation Initiatives; Housing and Community Development; Public Facilities; Infrastructure, etc. 2509.2 The CIP identifies each proposed capital project to be undertaken, the year the improvements or assets will be acquired or the project started, the amount of funds to be expended each year, and the way the expenditure will be funded. A CIP is not a static document. It is reviewed and updated on a regular basis (commonly on a yearly or two-year cycle) to reflect changing priorities, unexpected events, and new opportunities. The CIP includes investments in the repair and rehabilitation of existing infrastructure and facilities as well as the construction of new infrastructure and facilities. It can include capital items such as buildings, utility systems, roadways, bridges, parks, and other large investments such as land. 2509.3 IMPLEMENTATION COM PREHENSIVE PLAN D ISTRICT ELEM ENTS *ADOPTED 12/19/06 P. 3-8 All capital budget requests should be reviewed and considered for their consistency with the recommendations of the Comprehensive Plan. At this point in time, the District government develops an annual capital improvements budget but the link to the Comprehensive Plan remains weak. This is a critical gap in the city’s planning process that needs to be filled. The development of a multi-year CIP that is consistent with the Comprehensive Plan’s policies, actions, and priorities will allow the city to make investments where they are needed most, and ensure a more logical allocation of funds. 2509.4 Policy IM-2.1.1: Capital Improvement Linkages Link the city’s Capital Improvement Program (CIP) to the Comprehensive Plan. Comprehensive Plan priorities should be more effectively embedded within the CIP to ensure that public dollars are spent as efficiently and effectively as possible. 2509.5 Action IM-2.1-A: DC Code Revisions Revise the DC Code to formalize the link between the Comprehensive Plan and the multi-year Capital Improvements Plan. This link has been effective in other cities efforts to better tie capital expenditures to Comprehensive Plan recommendations and to increase the role and importance of the Comprehensive Plan. 2509.6 Action IM-2.1-B: Enhanced CIP Process Develop an enhanced CIP process that a) Uses the Comprehensive Plan as the key guide to capital investments (b) Mandates a Public Facilities Master Plan – or, at least, an ongoing Master Public Facilities coordination program that assesses facility needs and coordinates the public improvement plans of multiple city agencies (c) Develops criteria for the review of capital projects for inclusion in the CIP that allows for an objective and transparent evaluation process (d) Includes an itemized allocation in the capital budget for implementation priorities that are specifically called for in the Comprehensive Plan (e) Clarifies the role of the Office of Planning in the CIP process (f) Ensures adequate staffing is in place and is available to support the CIP process 575 (g) Develops and maintains a multi-year capital improvements planning process based on the Comprehensive Plan. 2509.7 IM- 2.2 Recommended Changes to the Zoning Regulations 2510 As noted in Section IM-1.3, the Zoning Regulations are a primary vehicle for implementing the Comprehensive Plan. The responsibility for zoning in the District of Columbia rests with the Zoning Commission. The Commission must give “great weight” to the recommendations of the Office of Planning on zoning cases, but has their own staff support (in the Office of Zoning 2510.1 Actions for the Zoning Commission to consider during its planned update and revision of the zoning regulations are highlighted in Table 25-1. This list is a roll-up of all the actions contained in the Elements of this Comprehensive Plan, including recommended changes to zoning or items that need further study. Some of the text in the table has been shortened here – the full text can be found in the Elements of the Plan. Some of the recommended changes should be made in the short-term rather than waiting until the Zoning Regulations update. 2510.2 IMPLEMENTATION COM PREHENSIVE PLAN D ISTRICT ELEM ENTS *ADOPTED 12/19/06 P. 3-9 IM-3.0 Monitoring, Evaluating, and Amending the Comprehensive Plan 2511 This section describes how and when monitoring and evaluation of the Comprehensive Plan should occur and how regular reporting can foster more accountability and openness in the Comprehensive Planning process. It also makes recommendations on the process and schedule for updating and amending the Comprehensive Plan in the future. 2511.1 IM-3.1 Monitoring and Evaluating Comprehensive Plan Implementation 2512 The District of Columbia needs to be able to measure successes and challenges in Comprehensive Plan implementation. The Office of Planning shall prepare an overall implementation calendar for the Comprehensive Plan, scheduling individual items with planned startup points and planned completion. The implementation shall include the administrative staffing for ensuring that the various necessary actions across the District government are undertaken. The best way to measure progress would be a biennial (once every two years) Implementation progress report by the Office of Planning through the Mayor to the Council of the District of Columbia. This is a vital part of keeping the planning process open, transparent, and responsive. It can also be a vehicle for review and refinement of implementation priorities, deletion of completed actions, and the addition of new actions or policies. 2512.1 The Office of Planning should make the Comprehensive Plan progress report a highly publicized effort to demonstrate the important role the Comprehensive Plan plays in decisions that affect the change, growth and development of the city. This will also keep the Comprehensive Plan process a topic of public discourse. 2512.2 See also Action IM-1.4-A earlier in this Element on Progress Reports. IM-3.2 Updating and Amending the Comprehensive Plan 2513 The 1984 Comprehensive Plan was amended only four times in 20 years. While the DC Code calls for the Comprehensive Plan to be amended “not less frequently than once every four years”, that target was not consistently achieved. In addition, when the amendment process did occur, it took years—even for small, incremental amendments. 2513.1 The existing four-year amendment cycle also does not contemplate periodic major revisions. A major revision is a more intensive effort than the amendment process, as whole sections of the Comprehensive Plan are re-written, based on the analysis of current data and challenges. In most cities, this process 576 takes two or three years to complete. 2513.2 The 2003 Comprehensive Plan Assessment report concluded that the Comprehensive Plan amendment process took too long, did not include enough analysis of the need for (or impact of) individual amendments, and was not as transparent as was desired. The following recommendations respond to this conclusion and are organized into four categories The timeline for the Comprehensive Plan amendment cycle The process for submitting proposed amendments The process for evaluating proposed amendments The process for approving proposed amendments. 2513.3 IMPLEMENTATION COMPREHENSIVE PLAN DISTRICT ELEMENTS *AD OPTED 12/19/06 P. 3-10 IM- 3.2.1 The Amendment Timeline It is recommended that the Comprehensive Plan be amended at least every four years and that a major revision/update of the Comprehensive Plan be completed every 12 years. The review of the practices of other major cities completed as part of the Comprehensive Plan Assessment suggests that a 10 to 15 year cycle for major revisions to the Comprehensive Plan is appropriate. The major revision would reassess all Comprehensive Plan policies, including citywide and area element policies. It would not necessarily include a total re-write of each Element but would focus instead on deleting outdated or irrelevant policies and actions, and editing or adding policies and actions to reflect emerging issues. The current provision that the Mayor can also submit amendments at other times should be retained. 2513.4 It is further recommended that the first amendment cycle be initiated in 2008, two years after this Comprehensive Plan is adopted. There are two reasons for this: 1) amendments may be necessary soon after the revision to address unanticipated issues associated with new language in the Comprehensive Plan, and 2) to make the amendment cycle fall appropriately between election cycles. Amendment cycles are thus recommended in 2008-2009 and then again four years later in 2012-2013 with a major update/revision envisioned in 2016-2018. 2513.5 Timeline for a Typical Amendment Cycle It is recommended that amendments be sent by the Mayor to the City Council in May of the amendment year (2009, 2013, etc to avoid delays related to budget hearings that usually are completed by April. The details of the recommended timeline for the amendment process are as follows for 2008-2009 as an example: 2513.6 April-Aug 2008: The Office of Planning conducts extensive public outreach to inform the public of the opportunity to submit amendments. At least one meeting in each Ward should take place to describe the amendment process, answer questions pertaining to the Comprehensive Plan or amendment submission and review process, encourage appropriately documented submissions, and ensure public participation in the amendment process. During this time period, the Office of Planning itself would consider proposed amendments to reflect emerging issues, new small area plans, outdated actions, map changes, etc. Sept 15, 2008: Deadline for submitting proposed amendments to the Office of Planning. Sept-Nov 2008: Initial screening of the proposed amendments by the Office of Planning to ascertain whether or not they are issues that can be addressed in the Comprehensive Plan. The Office of Planning would hold a public meeting to publicize what proposed amendments had been submitted. 577 Dec 2008-Feb 2009: The Office of Planning coordinates the technical/policy analysis of the proposed amendments. The Office of Planning then prepares an “Amendment Report and Recommendations”. Mar-April 2009: Mayor forwards recommendations to the Council. May-Sept 2009: Council holds public hearings in June and takes final action by September. If new amendments are proposed as a result of public hearings, these are forwarded to The Office of Planning for analysis during Council’s summer recess. Oct 2009: After Council action, the Mayor may approve or veto the Council-approved Comprehensive Plan amendments. Nov-Dec 2009: After Mayoral approval, Congressional review (30 days) and NCPC review (60 days) run concurrently. If no changes are requested, then the amended Comprehensive Plan is formally adopted. 2513.7 IMPLEMENTATION COMPREHENSIVE PLAN DISTRICT ELEMENTS *AD OPTED 12/19/06 P. 3-11 IM-3.2.2 Amendment Submittal Process 2514 The Comprehensive Plan amendment process provides an opportunity for individuals, groups, city agencies, or the federal government to propose a change to the Comprehensive Plan to address changes in conditions and to reflect on-going work or new information. Proposed amendments can include changes to the text or maps of the Comprehensive Plan. 2514.1 Documenting the Reason and Rationale for Each Amendment Demonstration that a change to the Comprehensive Plan is required lies solely with the applicant/proposer. The greater the degree of change proposed, the greater the burden of showing that the change is justified. Substantial reasons for amending the Comprehensive Plan include a) Significant changes have occurred since the adoption of the Comprehensive Plan that necessitate the proposed amendment (b) Inconsistencies in land use or other plan objectives and policies exist in the adopted Comprehensive Plan that affect a geographical area of the District c) The District government’s ability to achieve the goals and objectives of the Comprehensive Plan will be increased, or the operations of District government will be enhanced, as a result of the proposed amendment d) Existing Comprehensive Plan goals, policies, or actions inhibit the ability of District government to achieve other public policy objectives e) Substantial improvement in the quality of life for District residents will be achieved f) Adoption of the proposed amendment is necessary to incorporate public policies established by the District government that are not reflected in the Comprehensive Plan g) The amendment is needed to ensure continued consistency with the Federal Elements. 2514.2 The following supporting information will be required when an amendment is proposed a) If applicable, the location/general area that would be affected by the proposed change b) A detailed description and explanation of the proposed text/map amendment, including the text and the specific language to be amended c) A description of how the issue is currently addressed in the Comprehensive Plan. If it is not addressed, the public need for it must be described d) An explanation of why the proposed change is the best means for meeting the identified public need, and what other options exist for meeting this need e) The anticipated impacts of the change, including the impacts on the geographic area affected and the issues presented. This should include an assessment of net benefits to the city resulting from the change. 578 (f) Demonstration that the proposed change would be in conformance with the goals, policies and actions of the Comprehensive Plan. The applicant would be requested to include any data, research or reasoning that supports the proposed amendment g) Demonstration of public support for the proposed amendment (as illustrated, for example, by discussion of the proposal at a public meeting, such as an ANC meeting 2514.3 IM-3.2.3 Analysis and Review Process 2515 The analysis and review process must provide the public with opportunities to review and discuss the proposed amendments prior to submission to Council. This process is outlined below. 2515.1 IMPLEMENTATION COMPREHENSIVE PLAN DISTRICT ELEMENTS *AD OPTED 12/19/06 P. 3-12 Initial Screen The Office of Planning screens the proposed amendments. This first screen is a quick assessment to determine which proposed amendments are not proper subjects for inclusion in a Comprehensive Plan (such as operating, budget or legislative matters The Office of Planning holds a public meeting to share its initial findings with the public. [If a Planning Commission were created, the Commission would hold a hearing to discuss the proposed amendments, including those that are determined to not be appropriate for the Comprehensive Plan.] The Office of Planning then conducts an analysis of those amendments determined to be appropriate. 2515.2 Technical/Policy Analysis The Office of Planning analyzes the amendments and also coordinates the review of the proposed amendments with other District agencies. After collecting comments from other agencies, OP staff makes a recommendation that includes a detailed analysis. Staff then provides a “Proposed Amendments Report and Recommendations” and submits this report to the Mayor and the Council. [If a Planning Commission were created, then the Commission would hold a hearing and develop recommendations, which would then be sent to the Mayor and/or Council.] 2515.3 Proposed amendments would not be considered favorably if they were inconsistent with District law, more properly applicable to the Federal Elements than the District Elements of the Plan, included proposals that were beyond the legal scope or purview of the Comprehensive Plan, or submitted on a “marked up” or annotated copy of the Plan. Amendments to the Area Elements would be subject to the same criteria as amendments to the citywide elements. 2515.4 IM-3.2.4 Approval Process 2516 DC Council Review and Adoption The following text outlines the steps in the Council review and adoption process for Comprehensive Plan amendments a) The Council Committee of the Whole (Committee) holds a public hearing to receive comments on proposed amendments submitted by the Mayor. Any new or significantly modified amendment proposals are sent to the Office of Planning to conduct technical analysis and formulate recommendations b) Once recommendations are provided, the Committee holds a meeting to consider and vote on which amendments should be adopted (the Council Chairman develops an initial recommendation for the Committee to review c) Following approval by the Committee of the Whole, Council considers and votes on an amendment 579 package in at least two legislative meetings (first and second readings) no less than two weeks apart. Any new or significantly modified amendment that is generated during any of these readings would be required to be accompanied by planning analysis and recommendation prior to the Council taking final action on the amendment d) If a new or significantly modified amendment substantially changes the form of the Comprehensive Plan legislation, the Council would then schedule another reading on the legislation at least two weeks later (this could mean that Council holds a third reading 2516.1 Mayoral Approval It is the Mayor’s responsibility to take action to approve or veto the amendments. 2516.2 IMPLEMENTATION COMPREHENSIVE PLAN DISTRICT ELEMENTS *AD OPTED 12/19/06 P. 3-13 Federal Review The District-approved amendments are forwarded to Congress for a 30-day review period and to NCPC for a 60-day review period to assess the potential negative impacts of each amendment on the federal interest. If NCPC finds “no potential negative impacts on the federal interest” then the Comprehensive Plan amendments go into effect. If NCPC recommends changes to address negative impacts on the federal interest, then the Council must act to amend the plan to address NCPC requested changes. 2516.3 IM-3.3 Action Planning 2517 The section rolls-up all the actions included in the text of the Comprehensive Plan into an overall action plan (Table 25.1 The Action Plan includes a) The District agencies or other bodies that have the responsibilities for carrying out each Comprehensive Plan action (note: a list of agencies and abbreviations is included at the end of this Element b) The recommended implementation timeframe (see further explanation below and (c) Those actions that will require capital funds for implementation. 2517.1 Priority actions are highlighted with the symbol Actions for the Zoning Commission to consider are highlighted with the symbol 2517.2 The recommended implementation timeframe classifies actions as follows a) on-going actions are continuous activities that should be occurring now and on a regular basis into the future (b) immediate actions are actions that are about to commence or that should be initiated during 2006 or 2007 (c) “short-term” actions are actions that should be initiated by 2008 or 2009. Some short-term actions may take several years to complete (d) “mid-term” actions should be initiated by 2010 or 2011. Some mid-term actions may begin sooner than 2010, depending on funding and available staff resources (e) “long-term” actions include actions which may take many years to implement, and actions which may not begin until after 2010 due to funding and staff constraints or other factors 2517.3 It is recognized that when this Comprehensive Plan is adopted, there may not be complete agreement between the timeframes set here and the city’s approved Capital Improvement Program. Over time, a stronger link should be established so that the two documents are synchronized and eventually are in full agreement. Similarly, it should also be recognized that the actions listed below should not be interpreted as budgetary mandates. The intent is to convey a roster of priorities that should guide the Mayor and Council as they develop, approve, and execute annual operating and capital budgets. 2517.4 As noted on Page 25-1, Table 25.1 is a roll-up of all the actions contained in the Elements of this 580 Comprehensive Plan.

Work with land owners, the DC Council, local ANCs, community organizations, W MATA, and the Zoning Commission to determine the stations where such a zone should be applied. The emphasis should be on stations that have the capacity to accommodate substantial in creases in ridership and the potential to become pedestrian-oriented urban villages. Neighborhoods that meet these criteria and that would welcome a TO D overlay are the highest priority. 581 OP, OZ, ZC, CC Short-Term N IMPLEMENTATION COMPREHENSIVE PLAN DISTRICT ELEMENTS *AD OPTED 12/19/06 P. 3-15 Responsible Agency(ies) Timeframe Capital Funds Needed (Y/N) A CITY OF NEIGHBORHOODS LU-2.1-A: Rowhouse Zoning District.
