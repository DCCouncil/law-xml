        <text>Before making a demand that the governor of another state surrender an individual charged criminally in the District with having failed to provide for the support of an obligee, the Mayor may require a prosecutor of the District to demonstrate that at least 60 days previously the obligee had initiated proceedings for support pursuant to this act or that the proceeding would be of no avail.</text>

If it appears that a proceeding would be effective but has not been initiated, the Mayor may delay honoring the demand for a reasonable time to permit the initiation of a proceeding.</text>
