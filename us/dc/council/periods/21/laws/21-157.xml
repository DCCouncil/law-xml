      <summary>Law 21-157 establishes a minimum work week for building service employees of 30 hours provided that certain requirements are met including up to twenty percent of work hours for employees engaged in cleaning may be preserved for part-time employees with a minimum shift of four hours per night and twenty hours per week  per employee. It establishes a posting requirement for employers to post in a conspicuous place, a notice that sets forth the pertinent provisions of the legislation. It establishes civil penalties for noncompliance of not more than $5,000 and administrative penalties of not more than $1,000. An employee can request administrative enforcement of this legislation via a signed complaint for failure to provide a minimum work week filed no later than 3 years after the last date upon which the violation occurred. After exhausting all administrative remedies, an aggrieved employee may bring a civil action in DC Superior Court. FUNDING NOTE - This law is Subject to Appropriations.
