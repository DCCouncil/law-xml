      <summary>BILL SUMMARY - As introduced, this bill requires the Office of the State Superintendent for Education, local education agencies, and vendors they contract or partner with to protect the digital privacy of students enrolled or formerly enrolled in the District's public and charter schools. The data to be protected includes the personal information of the student or student's guardian, and any data that can be de-aggregated or reconstructed to identify individual students. The bill's provisions include substantive and procedural rules for accessing, tracking, analyzing, storing, or sharing student data. It also prohibits educational agencies from compelling students to share their social media account passwords or configuring their privacy settings to allow third-party access. Exceptions are provided for circumstances in which the safety or health of the student is implicated. </summary>
