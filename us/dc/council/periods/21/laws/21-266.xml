      <summary>Law 21-266 requires all bona fide administrative, executive, and professional employees as defined in 7 D.C.M.R. 999.1 be paid at least once a month and exempts employers from being required to pay them twice a month. The legislation, among other things, clarifies that the Attorney General and certain membership organizations can bring civil enforcement actions in court. It revises criminal penalties for noncompliance. It removes the exemption of parking lot and garage attendants from District overtime laws. Among other things, it also requires employers, including temporary staffing agencies, to provide notice regarding payment to an employee in a second language if certain conditions are met. It clarifies the remedies and procedures available to those who claim employers are noncompliant with this legislation.  </summary>
