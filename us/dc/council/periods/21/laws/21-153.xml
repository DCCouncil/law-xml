      <summary>Law 21-153 provides that if a potential or actual conflict of interest is disclosed or known by the board of directors of a charter school, prior to voting on a contract or transaction, it shall not be void due to the conflict or due to the presence or participation of the entity at a meeting of the board of directors, if it is approved by a majority of the disinterested members. The bill defines a conflicting interests transaction involving public charter schools. It provides a chartering body with the authority to require the production of financial books and records of contracting vendors and it, among other things, defines the circumstances under which actions by a charter school  may be classified as fiscal mismanagement.   </summary>
