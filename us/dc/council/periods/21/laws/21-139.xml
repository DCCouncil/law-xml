      <summary>Law 21-139 makes changes to the District's Home Purchase Assistance Program. It requires the Mayor to review the repayment structure of the Home Purchase Assistance Program and provide additional repayment options for the lowest income loan recipients. Options to be included are a graduated repayment system and the postponement of repayment on individual loans until after the home is sold. The bill also increases the maximum loan amount to $80,000 from $50,000. The Mayor must submit the revised repayment system to the Council within 60 days after the bill becomes effective.</summary>
