      <summary>Law 21-238 makes changes to District law regarding detainment of minors. It redefines the term "child" to include more persons and prohibits the following: (1) the placement of children into detention facilities prior to a fact-finding or dispositional hearing solely because they have been declared to be in need of supervision; (2) the placement of individuals under the age of 18 into adult penal institutions; (3) and the transfer of legal custody from parents or guardians to a government entity after a finding of delinquency as relating to a child under the age of ten. The bill also includes provisions eliminating the legal presumption that detention is required in certain circumstances; authorizes certain persons to view ordinarily confidential juvenile records; requires the Attorney General to develop a program to provide victim-offender mediation as an alternative to prosecution if both parties agree; and requires the Department of Youth Rehabilitation Services and the Department of Corrections to conduct and submit an annual analysis to the Council on room confinement in penal and juvenile institutions. </summary>
