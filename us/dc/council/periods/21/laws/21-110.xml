      <summary>Subrogation involves an insurer or other third party's attempt to recoup a portion or all of the payments made to the harmed individual from another party who legally bares the responsibility for the harm. Law 21-110 reduces the amount payable in a subrogation claim to a third-party payor for health-care benefits or services paid on behalf of an injured person. A "third party payor" means any person who provides accident and sickness benefits or medical, surgical or hospital benefits including insurance carriers, governmental agencies and employers. </summary>
