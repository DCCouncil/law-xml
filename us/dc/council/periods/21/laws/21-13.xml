      <summary>Law 21-13 requires the Health Benefit Exchange Authority to provide a "Notice of Assessment" to each health carrier doing business in the District with direct gross receipts of $50,000 or more in the preceding calendar year. The assessment amount is based on a percentage of the health carrier's direct gross receipts for the preceding calendar year. Each carrier is required to pay the amount noted in the "Notice of Assessment" within 30 business days of receipt of the notice. It mandates that the Authority adjust the assessment rate in each assessable year. If the health carrier fails to pay the assessment, it will be subject to the Insurance Regulatory Trust Fund Act of 1993 (§31-1204). These proceeds shall fund the Health Benefit Exchange Authority. </summary>
