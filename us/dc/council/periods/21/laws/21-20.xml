      <summary>Law 21-20 mandates the Department of Health to require hospitals and maternity centers to perform congenital heart defect screening, using pulse oximetry, on every newborn at its facility prior to discharge, unless the procedure is refused based on the parent's religious beliefs. The Department of Health must be notified on a quarterly basis regarding the number of infants screened, the results of those screenings, and any documented parental refusals.   </summary>
