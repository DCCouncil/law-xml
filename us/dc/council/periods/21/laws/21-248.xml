      <summary>Law 21-248 imposes a limit on the amount that a person must pay, in copayment or coinsurance, through a health benefit plan, for a prescription for a specialty drug. The copayment shall not exceed $150 per month for up to a 30-day supply of the specialty drug. A specialty drug includes a prescription drug prescribed for a condition that may have no known cure, is progressive, or can be debilitating or fatal if left untreated, and affects fewer than 200,000 persons in the United States. It also provides that a health benefit plan or its representative may request that a non-preferred drug be covered under the cost sharing applicable for preferred drugs if the prescribing physician determines that the preferred drug, available for treatment of the same condition, either would not be as effective for the individual or would have adverse effects for the individual. Non-preferred drugs are specialty drug formulary classifications that are subject to limits on eligibility for coverage or subject to higher cost-sharing amounts than preferred specialty drugs.</summary>
