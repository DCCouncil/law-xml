  <text>BE IT ENACTED BY THE COUNCIL OF THE DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA, That this act may be cited as the "Homeless Shelter Replacement Act of 2016".</text>
  <section>
    <num>2</num>
    <text>The Council finds that:</text>
    <para>
      <num>(1)</num>
      <text>On a given night in the District, more than 7,000 men, women, and children experience homelessness.</text>
    </para>
    <para>
      <num>(2)</num>
      <text>Each day, the DC General Family Shelter houses approximately 250 families experiencing homelessness.</text>
    </para>
    <para>
      <num>(3)</num>
      <text>The DC General Family Shelter is antiquated and inadequate, and its current conditions limit the District's ability to provide necessary services and support to families experiencing homelessness.</text>
    </para>
    <para>
      <num>(4)</num>
      <text>Best practices suggest that children and families do best when short-term housing is provided in smaller-scale, service-enriched, community-based settings, and it is therefore in the best interest of the District to replace the DC General Family Shelter with a series of facilities throughout the District that provide temporary shelter.</text>
    </para>
    <para>
      <num>(5)</num>
      <text>The apartments used by the District to provide temporary shelter to families experiencing homelessness at 1433 and 1435 Spring Road, N.W. (the "Spring Road Shelter"), are antiquated and in need of replacement, and the District's lease of those apartments is expiring.</text>
    </para>
    <para>
      <num>(6)</num>
      <text>In order to close the DC General Family Shelter and replace the Spring Road Shelter, the District needs to construct new facilities that are safe and dignified spaces for families experiencing homelessness.</text>
    </para>
    <para>
      <num>(7)</num>
      <text>It is in the best interest of the District to construct these new temporary-shelter facilities on District-owned land, in part to avoid the disruption to the provision of services in the continuum of care that would accompany the eventual expiration of leases.</text>
    </para>
    <para>
      <num>(8)</num>
      <text>The new shelter facilities will be constructed on District-owned land; however, for 2 sites, the District will need to acquire the necessary property; doing so will advance the important goals of ensuring that the District owns the land on which each of the facilities is constructed and that each of the facilities is located in a different Ward, which in turn will allow the District to provide small-scale, community-based temporary housing services throughout the District.</text>
