  <heading type="long">To amend section 16-916.01 of the District of Columbia Official Code to revise and update the child support guideline to expand the definition of perquisites or in-kind compensation to include military housing and food allowances, to allow a judicial officer to enter a minimum order when the paying parent is uncooperative or no reliable income information exists, to update the self-support reserve, to increase the presumptive minimum award amount to $75 per month, to expand the factors a judicial officer may consider to determine whether the presumption of a $75 minimum order has been rebutted, to establish a procedure for rebutting the presumptive minimum award, to allow the judicial officer to consider the subsistence needs of the parent owed support in applying the presumptive minimum award and the low income adjustment, to establish a modified self-support reserve, and to provide for the starting date for orders and agreements.</heading>

      <summary>Law 21-107 provides clarifying language regarding how perquisite or in-kind compensation (such as any profit that is incidental to salary or wages) is factored into gross income.  It allows a judicial officer to enter a minimum order where the paying parent is uncooperative and no reliable income information exists.  It expands factors to be considered by a judiciary officer to determine whether a presumptive minimum award has been rebutted. Among other things, the legislation increases the minimum child support payment from $50 to $75.</summary>
