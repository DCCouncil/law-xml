      <summary>Law 21-166 redefines the term vulnerable adults and changes the age of enhanced penalties regarding crimes against seniors from 60 to persons aged 65 and older.  It expands the crimes of criminal abuse and neglect of vulnerable adults to include financial exploitation of a vulnerable adult or elderly person. It defines undue influence and establishes factors to determine whether a result was produced by undue influence.  It establishes criminal and civil penalties for a vulnerable adult or elderly person.  Among other things it gives the Attorney General the authority to issue subpoenas and to seek injunctive relief when prosecuting these crimes. </summary>
