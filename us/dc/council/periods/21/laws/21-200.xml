      <summary>Law 21-200 requires that a designation of vacant or blighted property remain until the property owner submits sufficient information to the Mayor to change the classification. It allows for certain exceptions from registering a property as vacant based on the current level of active construction or renovation. It clarifies that the allowable time for the exemption is one year for a residential building and two years for a commercial property. It increases the maximum fine of noncompliance with certain vacant registration requirements from $1000 to a fine not to exceed $5000.</summary>
