      <summary>Law 21-267 requires the Mayor to transmit a semiannual report to the Council regarding the sale of District land. The report must describe among other things, the difference between the proposed sales price of the land and the market value of the land. The Mayor is also required to hold public hearings to obtain community input on potential public uses of the real property to determine whether the real property is no longer required for public purposes. It identifies how a resolution to dispose of real property that is determined to no longer be required for public purposes shall be submitted to the Council. It also establishes under what conditions the Mayor may waive certain affordable-housing requirements. </summary>
