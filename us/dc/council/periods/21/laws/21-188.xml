      <summary>Law 21-188 clarifies that a 6 year statute of limitations applies to instances where an overstatement of basis results in an understatement of reported gross income. Current law states if the taxpayer omits an amount of gross income stated in the return, the tax may be assessed, or a proceeding in court for the collection of the tax may be begun without assessment, at any time within 6 years after the return was filed. This conforms to the federal statute of limitations in cases of overstatement of basis.  </summary>
