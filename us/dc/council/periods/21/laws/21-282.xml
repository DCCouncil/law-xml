      <summary>Law 21- 282 makes various changes to the law regarding wildlife and natural resources. It designates the American shad and Hay's Spring amphipod as the official fish and amphipod of the District, respectively; establishes an Aquatic Resources Education program to be administered by the District Department of Energy and the Environment (DOEE); authorizes the Mayor to draft and enforce rules to restrict, prohibit, regulate, and control the sale, possession, exhibition, hunting , fishing, and taking of wildlife in the District, inclusive of fees and for certain civil and criminal offenses; and establishes a special purpose fund, the Fishing License Fund. The bill also includes provisions that govern the licensure and stewardship of watercrafts, and prohibits the sale of personal care products that contain plastic microbeads.</summary>

        <text>The American shad (<em>Alosa sapidissima</em>) is an anadromous species of game fish native to the eastern United States and Canada. Spending much of their lives at sea, American shad leave the ocean to find river systems and migrate, or "run," upstream into freshwater environments to spawn in their birthplaces, including the Potomac River.</text>
      </para>
      <para>
        <num>(b)</num>
        <text>Once abundant in the Potomac River watershed and considered one of the most valuable commercial fisheries in the United States, the American shad has experienced species-threatening declines throughout the entirety of its native range. A combination of factors have contributed to these declines, such as overfishing, degraded water quality, the recovery of shad predator species, the closing of historic shad spawning waters, and the building of dams for hydroelectric power.</text>
      </para>
      <para>
        <num>(c)</num>
        <text>In response to American shad population declines, the District and others, beginning in 2005, undertook restoration activities, including education, reopening fish passages, manual spawning, chemical marking, stocking, and identification. Since restoration efforts began, more than 10 miles of closed spawning surface waters have been opened and more than 10 million American shad hatchlings have been manually spawned and released.</text>
      </para>
      <para>
        <num>(d)</num>
        <text>In 2011, the Potomac River Fisheries Commission reported that American shad population targets for the Potomac River established by the Atlantic States Marine Fisheries Commission have been met and that the American shad population for the Potomac River had recovered. The District will continue its restoration efforts to ensure the future of the species.</text>

        <text>The Hay's Spring amphipod (<em>Stygobromus hayi</em>) is a federally-endangered, globally-rare species of crustacean that is native to, and found only in, a few springs within the District's portion of the Rock Creek watershed.</text>
