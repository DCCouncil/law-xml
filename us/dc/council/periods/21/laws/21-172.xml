  <heading type="long">To amend the Rental Housing Act of 1985 to limit the amount of a late fee a housing provider may charge a residential tenant for the late payment of rent, to establish a minimum grace period before a late fee may be imposed, to prohibit a housing provider from charging interest on a late fee, deducting any amount of a late fee from a subsequent rent payment, imposing a late fee more than one time on each late payment, evicting a tenant on the basis of the nonpayment of a late fee, or from imposing a late fee on a tenant for the late payment or nonpayment of any portion of the rent for which a rent subsidy provider, rather that the tenant, is responsible for paying, and to establish penalties for violations of these provisions.</heading>

      <summary>This law limits the amount of late fees a landlord may charge a tenant for unpaid rent. It defines the term "late payment" to mean rent that is unpaid within 10 days of the due date; caps late fees to 5% of the unpaid amount of rent; requires that the late fee be charged only once and correlate to the unpaid amount of rent; and prohibits landlords from assessing late fees unless a written agreement between the landlord and tenant provides for the imposition of late fees. Finally, it provides for the imposition of a civil fine if its provisions are violated, and up to three times of the excess late fee collected to be transmitted to the tenant from the landlord.</summary>
