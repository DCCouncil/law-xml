      <summary>Law 21-258 establishes what information should be on a death certificate. It requires that the decedent's gender identity shall be reported by the next of kin or the best qualified person available unless a document that memorializes the decedent's gender transition is presented to the person completing the death certificate. It allows an individual with rights to the decedent's remains to file a petition in Superior Court for determining gender identity or expression. It protects the person completing the death certificate from liability for damages or costs for how they enter the decedent's gender. </summary>
