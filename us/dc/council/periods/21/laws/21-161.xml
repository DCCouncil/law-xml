      <summary>Law 21-161 establishes new procedures to designate an official name or a symbolic name for a street, alley, or other public place. Among other things, it establishes notice requirements to all residents and owners of all the property that abuts the alley at least 15 days prior to the date of any public hearing. It establishes notice requirements to ANCs at least 30 days prior to the public hearing. The initiator of the proposal shall submit a petition to the Council in support of the proposal that has been signed by a majority of the residents and owners of property that abuts the portion of the alley or street proposed to be designated with an official name at least 15 days prior to the date of any public hearing. It also requires the Mayor to update relevant records of the District of Columbia to reflect the name change..</summary>
