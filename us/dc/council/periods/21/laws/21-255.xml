It also clarifies that a gamete or embryo donor, or his or her spouse or partner, shall not have any parental rights with respect to the child. It establishes eligibility requirements and procedures for filing a petition for parentage in DC Superior Court. It establishes the requirements for an enforceable surrogacy agreement and the conditions under which such an agreement may be dissolved.  </summary>
