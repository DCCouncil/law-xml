      <summary>Law 21-277 prohibits the application of certain pesticides to schools, child-occupied facilities, waterbody-contingent property or District property. The bill permits the District Department of Energy and Environment (DOEE) to reclassify materials, known to be hazardous to human health, based on the findings of state, national, international government bodies, or non-governmental organizations. Finally, the bill permits the DOEE to issue additional restrictions on the use of pesticides as needed and not specifically expressed in District law.</summary>
