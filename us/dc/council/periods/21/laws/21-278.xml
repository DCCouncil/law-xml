      <summary>Law 21-278 adopts the National Association of Insurance Commissioner's Risk-Based Capital trend test ratio. It requires that fraternal benefit societies (any insurance company licensed under the Fraternal Benefit Societies Act of 1998) are subject to the District's risk-based capital requirements.  This revision is necessary for the District to maintain its accredited status with the National Association of Insurance commissioners. </summary>
