      <summary>Law 21-280 makes several changes to services that may be provided by those who provide immigration services. It prevents unqualified immigration consultants from providing legal advice. It mandates that consumers have access to all documents prepared on their behalf. It imposes criminal sanctions for tampering with or removing an electronic monitoring device.  It expands the Governing Board of the Corrections Information Council from 3 to 5 members. It changes the age eligibility requirements for the police officer cadet program to 25 years old. It also establishes guidelines for the salary of rehired MPD officers who were previously retired. </summary>
