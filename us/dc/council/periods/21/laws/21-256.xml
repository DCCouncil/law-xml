      <summary>Law 21-256 prohibits an employer from inquiring about or requiring an applicant to provide information about their credit history during some portions of the hiring process. An exception is provided for when local or federal law requires that credit history be considered. The bill specifies that an applicant who believes that his or her credit history was unlawfully considered may request the documents the employer utilized when considering the applicant's application, and that an aggrieved applicant may file a complaint with the District's Office of Human Rights. </summary>
