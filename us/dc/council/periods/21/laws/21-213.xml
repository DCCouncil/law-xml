      <summary>Law 21-213 creates an exemption from the requirement to obtain a basic business license for businesses with de minimus business activity.  It also requires that landlords register a 24-hour contact number with the agency and post that number in a common area or in each unit for rent.  It also protects District homeowners against higher vacant property tax rates by ensuring that only the owner of record or an authorized agent may register the property as vacant.  A passerby's report of a suspected vacant property will be required to go through a standard complaint and inspection process before a homeowner receives an increased tax bill.  </summary>
