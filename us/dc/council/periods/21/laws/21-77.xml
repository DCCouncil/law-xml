It requires the Office of the State Superintendent of Education (OSSE) to establish and administer an undesignated epinephrine auto-injector plan authorizing a public school to possess and administer undesignated epinephrine auto-injectors. Epinephrine injectors may be utilized on public school property, field trips, and on sanctioned excursions away from public property. </summary>
