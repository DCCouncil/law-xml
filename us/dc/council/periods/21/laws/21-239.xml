  <heading type="short">Elderly Tenant and Tenant with a Disability Protection Amendment Act of 2016</heading>
  <heading type="long">To amend the Rental Housing Conversion and Sale Act of 1980 to modernize references to elderly tenants and tenants with disabilities and clarify the language in existing law regarding the Mayor's determination that a tenant qualifies as an elderly tenant or tenant with a disability under the act; to amend the Rental Housing Act of 1985 to standardize and modernize the definition of elderly tenants and tenants with disabilities, to require the Housing Commission to publish additional information pertinent to elderly tenants and tenants with disabilities, to prohibit an increase above the base rent unless a housing provider provides a tenant with information relevant to establishing elderly tenant and tenant with a disability status, to lower the cap on the annual standard rent increase for a unit occupied by an elderly tenant or a tenant with a disability to the Consumer Price Index, the Social Security COLA, or 5% of the current rent charged, whichever is least, to change the maximum annual income for low-income elderly tenants and low-income tenants with a disability to qualify for an exemption from a capital improvement surcharge from $40,000 to 60% of the area median income in the Washington Metropolitan Statistical Area for a household of 4 persons, and to establish that same amount as the maximum annual income for a low-income elderly tenant and a low-income tenant with a disability to qualify for an exemption from rent adjustments pursuant to a hardship petition, a services and facilities petition, and a substantial rehabilitation petition, to exempt current and future low-income elderly tenants and low-income tenants with a disability from a rent adjustment approved pursuant to a hardship petition, a services and facilities petition, and a substantial rehabilitation petition, in addition to the existing exemption from capital improvement surcharges, to provide housing providers with a tax credit for each unit occupied by a low-income elderly tenant or a low-income tenant with a disability to compensate for certain exemptions and limit the total combined tax credits claimed by all housing providers for any fiscal year to a maximum of $1.25 million, to prohibit a voluntary agreement from increasing the rent charged for a current or future elderly tenant or a tenant with a disability with a qualifying income, to permit a low-income elderly tenant or low-income tenant with a disability to waive his or her right to an exemption from a services and facilities petition or from an increase in rent charged resulting from a voluntary agreement, to permit a tenant to establish elderly or disability status by providing the minimum information necessary, and by filing the registration form by mail, fax, email, or in person at the Rental Accommodations Division, to establish that the Rent Administrator may deny registration for elderly or disability status only upon clear and convincing evidence of error, fraud, falsification, or misrepresentation, and only if the tenant has had the opportunity to respond to the denial or a challenge from the housing provider, to impose a penalty on a tenant upon a finding by the Rent Administrator of fraud, falsification, or misrepresentation of eligibility for elderly or disability status, and to provide for penalties if a housing provider's challenge to a tenant's registration to establish elderly or disability status is determined to have been frivolous or made in bad faith.</heading>

      <summary>Law 21-239 establishes new rental protections and financial supports for elderly tenants and tenants with a disability. It requires the Rental Housing Commission to publish the maximum rent increase that an elderly tenant or tenant with a disability may be subject to; prohibits landlords from raising the base rent of an elderly tenant or tenant with a disability without providing certain information to the tenant; raises the maximum allowable income of an elderly or disabled person seeking certain exemptions from various forms of rent increases; and lowers the amount which an elderly or tenant with a disability may be charged pursuant to the annual standard rent increase; and provides housing providers with compensatory tax credits for units occupied by elderly tenants or tenants with a disability, not to exceed $1.25 million per fiscal year.</summary>
