      <summary>Law 21-120 requires the Office of the State Superintendent for Education (OSSE) to adopt a rule requiring all District teachers and principals in public and charter schools to undergo training on suicide prevention, intervention, and postvention every two years. It requires the Office of the State Superintendent for Education (OSSE) to develop and publish online written guidance to assist LEAs in developing policies and procedures for handling various aspects of student mental and behavioral health. OSSE must examine and evaluate its guidance every 5 years, at minimum, and notify LEAs within 30 days of updating its guidance. The law also requires OSSE to establish and implement a pilot program to collect school climate data (data regarding engagement, safety, and environment) through school climate surveys, and report school climate data to the Mayor and Council annually.</summary>
