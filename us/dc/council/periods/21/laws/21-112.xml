      <summary>Law 21-112 makes changes to the District's summer youth employment program. Prior to this law, only youths between the ages of 14 and 21 were eligible to participate; this law raises the maximum age to 24. It also increases the pay rates of youths between the ages of 16 and 21 to $8.25 per hour and youths aged 22 to 24 to the minimum wage.</summary>
