      <summary>Law 21-155 makes changes to District law regarding motor vehicles, bicycles, and pedestrians. It requires the District Department of Transportation (DDOT) to publish certain statistical and geographical data on its website, establishes a safety program called the Bicycle and Pedestrian Priority Area Program, requires updated training  of operators associated with digital dispatch companies as well as vehicle for-hire operators, establishes an aggressive driving offense, orders DDOT to adopt an inclusive policy for accommodating all users of the District's roadways, and amends existing public safety laws by creating new motor vehicle, pedestrian, and bicycle regulations, including imposing a mandatory permanent license revocation for those convicted of a third Driving While Intoxicated (DWI) charge and by requiring mandatory participation in the Ignition Interlock System Program for DWI offenders.</summary>
