      <summary>Law 21-197 requires that rent increases requested by landlords pursuant to a hardship petition under section 212 must be decided by the Rent Administrator within 90 days after the petition has been filed. If certain requirements are met and the Rent Administrator has not rendered a decision within 90 days, the rent charged adjustment requested in the petition may be conditionally implemented by the landlord at the end of the 90-day period; provided, that the conditional rent increase shall not exceed 5% of the rent charged. This rent increase may be modified by the final decision of the Rent Administrator regarding the petition. If the Rent Administrator denies the requested rent increase or approves an amount less than the conditional increase charged by the landlord, the difference shall be returned to the tenant within 21 calendar days of the Rent Administrator's order. </summary>
