It also requires the Mayor to: (1) conduct a public information campaign that focuses on the impact of marijuana use and abuse; (2) report to the Council regarding substance abuse education in District schools, inclusive of marijuana use education; and (3) evaluate the effectiveness of the district's treatment programs in relation to the use and abuse of marijuana. </summary>
