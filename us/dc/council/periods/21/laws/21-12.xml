      <summary> Law 21-12 prohibits the suspension or expulsion of a student of pre-kindergarten age from any publicly funded pre-kindergarten program, unless a school administrator determines that the student has willfully caused or attempted to cause bodily injury, or threatened serious bodily injury to another person, excluding self-defense. Suspensions must not exceed longer than 3 days for any individual incident. It establishes annual reporting requirements for each local education agency on suspensions and expulsions data for all grades. The report is required to be completed by August 15th of each year. The Office of the State Superintendent of Education is required to share the information with the public by October first of each year.</summary>
