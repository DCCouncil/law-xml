  <heading type="long">To amend the Renewable Energy Portfolio Standard Act of 2004 to allow raw or treated wastewater used as a heat source or sink for a heating or cooling system to qualify as a tier one renewable source, to raise the renewable portfolio standard for tier one renewable sources to 50% by 2032 and the solar requirement to 5% by 2032, to require the Public Service Commission to provide a report to the Council relating to solar energy generated in the District that could qualify to be used to meet the annual solar energy requirement, but for which renewable energy credits cannot be purchased by electricity suppliers to meet the solar energy requirement, to change the alternative compliance payment for the solar requirement through 2032, and to expand the uses of the Renewable Energy Development Fund; and to amend the Clean and Affordable Energy Act of 2008 to increase the Sustainable Energy Trust Fund fee, and to establish a Solar for All Program within the Department of Energy and Environment for the purpose of increasing the access of seniors, small local businesses, nonprofits, and low-income households to the benefits of solar power.</heading>

      <summary>Law 21-154 adds waste heat from combined and sanitary sewage systems, and effluence from wastewater treatment to the list of Tier 1 renewable sources; raises the renewable portfolio and solar requirements to 50% and 5% by the year 2032, respectively; increases financial penalties for electricity suppliers who fail to comply with the renewable energy portfolio standard for the applicable year; and establishes a program within the Department of Energy and the Environment to assist low-income households, seniors, nonprofits, and small local businesses increase their access to the benefits of solar power. The program is required to reduce by at least 50% the electric bills of at least 100,000 of the District's low-income households with high energy burdens by December 31, 2032.</summary>
