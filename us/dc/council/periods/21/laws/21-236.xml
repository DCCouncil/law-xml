      <summary>Law 21-236 requires that certified business enterprises entering into certain certified joint ventures, that own the majority of the interest in the joint venture, would provide the bond for the project, and would be solely liable for at least 51% of each claim asserted under the bond. A bond ensures contract completion in the event of contractor default. The Department of Small and Local Business Development is required to submit to the Council a semiannual report on joint ventures. </summary>
