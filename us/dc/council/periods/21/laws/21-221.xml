          <text>There is established as a special fund the West End Library and Fire Station Maintenance Fund ("Maintenance Fund"),which shall be used solely to fundthe expenses of providing: supplemental maintenance service; common-area maintenance service; insurance; and capital improvements for the West End Library and West End Fire Station (collectively, the "Operating Expenses"). The Maintenance Fund shall supplement such other sums as are annually appropriated for the operation of branch libraries and fire stations, including the West End Library and West End Fire Station, and shall be used solely to ensure that both facilities are maintained in a manner that is consistent with the high-quality conditions of the larger buildings of which they are a part. The Maintenance Fund shall be used first to pay for the Operating Expenses, before other District funds are used, but the Maintenance Fund shall not be used otherwise to supplant local funds typically appropriated for the operation of branch libraries and fire stations.</text>
