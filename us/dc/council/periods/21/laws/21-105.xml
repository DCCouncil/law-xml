      <summary>This legislation permits individuals to obtain a judicial decree or judgment from DC Superior Court terminating their domestic partnership. Prior to this law, some jurisdictions refused to recognize the District's termination of domestic partnerships because individuals were only permitted to terminate their partnerships through the administrative processes at the Department of Health.  </summary>
