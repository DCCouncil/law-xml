Washingtoti I’C. 20036-2907 Dear Mr. Heideman: I am in receipt of your letter regarding Bill 12-12 Distribution of Marijuana Amendment Act of 1997 Acting Chairman Linda W. Cropp and the Members of the Council appreciate your comments on this matter, and your correspondence will be entered into the record. Sincerely, Secretary to the Council cc: Committee on the Judiciary Legislative Services Division THE HEIDEMAN A I)ISTRICT OF COLUMBIA PROFFESSIONAL CORPORATION 1714 N STREET, N.W WASHINGTON, D.C. 20036-290~ TE~PHON 202) 462-8990 TELEFAX (202) 462-8995 LAW GROU P.C. P2 ’i 8 29 May 1997 Committee on the Judiciary Council Record c/o Ms. Phyllis Jones 1350 Pennsylvania Avenue, Room 207 Washington, DC 20004 Re: Bill 12-12, the "Distribution of Marijuana Amendment Act of 1997" To Whom it May Concern: Please accept these written comments to be added to the official hearing record for the above referenced bill. As a criminal defense lawyer who has practiced for twenty-five years and as Vice- Chairman of the Legislative Committee of the National Association of Criminal Defense Lawyers, I feel obligated to appear on record and express my opposition to Bill 12-12, the Distribution of Marijuana Amendment Act of 1997, which creates mandatory minimum sentences for the possession and distribution of marijuana. Instead of helping to reduce the amount of drug related offenses committed by nonviolent offenders in the District of Columbia, this mandatory minimum sentence proposal will only increase the problems that are already present in the District’s overbutdened criminal justice system, in 1994, the Federal Judicial Center prepared a report ritled "The Consequences of Mandatory Minimum Prison Terms: A Summary of Recent Findings The report concluded that mandatory minimum sentences are not the most effective means of accomplishing sentencing goals, and "as instruments of public policy they do little good and much harm Most researchers who have studied the effects of mandatory minimum sentences have concluded that mandatory minimum sentences are harmful because they are not uniformly applied, they remove judicial discretion from neutral judges and place it with adversarial prosecutors, they have a disparate impact on minority offenders, they are unduly expensive, and they do not accomplish the goals of reducing crime or drug availability. In fact, the Department of Justice Report of December 1993 An Analysis of Non-Violent Drug Offenders with Minimal Criminal Histories at page 41 concluded that mandatory minimums neither reduce recidivism nor promote rehabilitation. I am not alone in my opposition to mandatory minimums, the judiciary and leading law enforcement officials have stated their opposition to mandatory minimums. At the National Symposium on Drugs and Violence in America, June 18, 1993, Supreme Court Chief Justice William H. Renquist summed up the collective opinion of many distinguished judges on the Federal bench and spoke out publicly against mandatory minimums. Justice Renquist opined I think I am in accord with most judges in the Federal System in the view that mandatory minimums are imprudent, unwise and often an unjust mechanism for sentencing. It takes away from the judge the ability to differentiate among a group of defendants involved in the same crime, according to levels of culpability and responsibility United States Attorney General Janet Reno has also stated her reservations about this policy, concluding that they must be reserved only for truly violent criminals, rather than be applied to non-violent, low level drug defendants. One of the arguments those in favor of mandatory minimums make is that these sentencing guidelines make our justice system more economical, however in reality this desired effect has not occurred. While it’s true some defendants may plead guilty to a lesser charge to avoid the possibility of a higher mandatory minimum if convicted to a greater offense, often it is innocent defendants who are accepting this plea bargain, afraid to take their chances with the criminal justice system. On the other side, the truly guilty defendants who may have once considered pleading guilty, now are insisting on taking their chances on being acquitted by going to trial in hopes of avoiding mandatory minimums which will be imposed. As a result of the new mandatory minimums, the District of Columbia will face an even greater crisis in its already overcrowded prison system. Violent offenders who were sentenced before mandatory minimums existed will be released on early parole to make room for the non-violent drug offenders with new mandatory minimum sentences. Instead of punishing our most dangerous offenders, we will be risking the safety of the community. Clearly, this would not be in the best interest of society or justice. Thank you for the opportunity to express my opposition to Bill 12-12, the Distribution of Marijuana Amendment Act of 1997. Sincerely, THE HEIDEMAN LAW GROUP, P.C.
