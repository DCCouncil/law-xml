Section 10(o)(1) of the Compulsory/No-Fault Motor Vehicle Insurance Act of 1982, effective September 18, 1982 (D.C. Law 4-155; D.C. Code § 35-2109(o)(1 is amended by striking the word "The" and inserting the phrase "If requested by the policyholder, the" in its place. Section 35-2109 TITLE V FISCAL IMPACT Sec. 501. Fiscal impact statement a) The purpose of Titles I through III of this legislation is to place the District of Columbia in compliance with the federal law. However, the legislation as it is written does not include certain tax provisions, and therefore, may not conform fully. The requirements in the bill are geared so that any person or group seeking some kind of consistent health related insurance will be able to obtain that coverage and will be treated the same as other individuals or groups who are similar. All this without regard to previously existing health status or conditions. The District government and its employees should not be affected with either required added coverage or new groups or individuals which now must be covered. Although there is the potential for a small added expense by the Office of Personnel for recordkeeping. The amount of this cost is not known at this time and cannot be estimated until the full extent of extra recordkeeping to be required is known. However, the District’s Insurance Commissioner has an added burden of interpretation and administration of the new bill. Consistent with its current funding, if the administration of the new legislation creates a financial burden on the Insurance Office, the cost will be passed on to the insurance carriers. Therefore, this legislation should not impact the Financial Plan and Budget. The Insurance Office expects to hire two DS-11 insurance examiner/specialists. The cost for two additional FTE’s will be approximately $90,000 for the first full year of the implementation b) The fiscal impact statement for Title IV of this act is as follows: 24 OFFICE OF THE BUDGET IBill Number 12-419 Type: Emergency Temporary Permanent x Subject/Short T~tle Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Federal Law Conformity Act of 1998" COUNCIL OF THE DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA FISCAL IMPACT STATEMENT Date Reported: 9/22/98 ENROLLED ORIGINAL 1.
