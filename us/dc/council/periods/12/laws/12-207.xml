Sec. 109. Facilities allowance for Public Charter Schools a) The FY 1999 facility allowance for Public Charter Schools shall be determined as follows: The total funds being estimated from all sources for the FY 1998 DCPS capital improvement program shall be divided by the 1997-1998 school year SY DCPS pupil count, as defined in section 107, to determine the "DCPS per pupil facility cost" for FY 1999. For FY 1999 only, this DCPS per pupil facility cost shall be multiplied by the number of students estimated to be attending each Public Charter School in SY 1998-1999 to determine the actual facility allowance payments to be received by each charter school in FY 1999 b) For FY 2000 and succeeding fiscal years, the facility allowance for Public Charter Schools shall be determined as described in subsection (a) of this section, except that the DCPS per pupil facility cost for FY 2000 shall be averaged with the DCPS per pupil facility cost for FY 1999, to determine the Public Charter School per pupil facility allowance for FY 2000. The FY 2000 Public Charter School per pupil facility allowance shall then be multiplied by the number of students estimated to be attending each Public Charter School in SY 1999-2000 to determine the actual facility allowance payments to be received by each Public Charter School in FY 2000. This "moving average" shall add 1 year each year until a total of 5 years are New Section 31-2906 New Section 31-2907 New Section 31-2908 6 ENROLLED ORIGINAL included in the calculations. Thereafter, the calculations shall include the most recent 5 years c) If supplemental funds for the capital improvement program are received by DCPS during any given fiscal year, the total of those supplemental funds shall be added to that fiscal year’s capital improvement program in determining that year’s DCPS per pupil facility cost in the next fiscal year’s calculations of the moving average d) For fiscal year 1999, the facilities allowance for Public Charter Schools shall be $617.00 per student e) Payment of the facility allowance to each Public Charter School which has applied shall be made on the same schedule as required for the payment of the per pupil allotments for operating funds, that is, 75% in October and 25% by May 1 st of each school year. Sec. 110. Cost of education adjustment. The foundation level shall be increased annually by the average percentage increase in the CPI for the preceding calendar year, or by 4 whichever is less. New Section 31-2909 Sec. 111. Procedure for adjusting appropriation in case of revenue unavailability. If in any given fiscal year the Council finds that full funding of the Formula from local revenues is inconsistent with legal requirements for a balanced budget, the following shall apply 1) The Council shall reduce the foundation level accordingly, and set a schedule for achieving or restoring full funding, however, funding shall not be less than 95% of the previous fiscal year’s funding; and (2) The Mayor, Council, Superintendent/CEO, Board of Education and the Emergency Transitional Education Board of Trustees shall use their best efforts to obtain temporary supplemental funding from other revenue sources. New Section 31-2910 Sec. 112. Periodic revision of Formula a) The Mayor and Council, in consultation with representatives of DCPS and of the Public Charter Schools, shall review and revise this Formula within 2 years of its establishment, within 2 years after this initial review and revision, and once every 4 years subsequently. Revisions shall be based upon information and data including study of actual costs of education in the District of Columbia, consideration of performance incentives created by the Formula in practice, research in education and education finance, and public comment b) The study of actual costs of education pursuant to subsection(a) of this section shall include but not be limited to the following 1) The relation of funding levels to student outcomes 2) Maintenance of effort in specified areas of focus to promote continuity of effective practices; New Section 31-2911 7 ENROLLED ORIGINAL (3) Improved techniques for determining specific levels of funding needed to provide adequate special education services; and (4) Improved measures of change in the cost of education. Sec. 113. Variations in per pupil allocations. Variations from uniformity in the Formula are not intended as an exercise of the Council’s line-item authority over the DCPS budget. Allocations by the count of students in certain grade levels and programs are intended only to generate total appropriation amounts on a per student basis. Sec. 114. Fiscal impact statement. The fiscal impact for the per student allocation is $511,672,535 for DCPS and $11,000,000 for Public Charter Schools for Fiscal Year 1999. The funding level is based on a foundation level of $5,500 plus weightings and a resident student enrollment count of 77,000 for DCPS and 2,000 for Public Charter Schools. The Public Charter Schools enrollment count of 2,000 was derived from the consensus budget work session. The FY 1999 local appropriation of $545,000,000 for DCPS and $12,235,000 for Public Charter Schools covers the per student expenditures. The fiscal impact for the Public Charter Schools facilities allowance is $2,080,000. The funding level is based on allocation of $1040 per student multiplied by a resident student enrollment count of 2,000 for Public Charter Schools. Due to budget constraints and the fact that DCPS’ capital budget is based on an amount which is inflated by extraordinary costs (i.e DCPS had to repair a significant amount of roofs and other repairs at the same time the per student allocation of $1040 is decreased to $617.00 per student, which amounts to a total of $1,234,000 for the facilities allowance payment. The FY 1999 appropriation of $12,235,000 for Public Charter Schools covers the per student cost of $11,000,000 and facilities allowance cost of $1,234,000. Assuming that the variables remain constant, the fiscal impact for the next 5 years, which includes a 2% inflation increase, is as follows: FY 2000: FY 2001: FY 2002: FY 2003: FY 2004 521,905,985 (DCPS) and $12,478,680 (charter schools 532,344,104 (DCPS) and $12,728,253 (charter schools 542,990,986 (DCPS) and $12,982,718 (charter schools 553,850,805 (DCPS) and $13,242,372 (charter schools and $564,927,881 (DCPS) and $13,507,219 (charter schools New Section 31-2912 ENROLLED ORIGINAL Title II. Amendments to the District of Columbia Tax Conformity Amendment Act of 1998. Sec. 201. The District of Columbia Tax Conformity Amendment Act of 1998, signed by the Mayor on May 22, 1998 (D.C. Act 12-371; to be codified at D.C. Code §§ 47-1801.4 and 47-2608 is amended as follows a) Section 2(b)(2) is amended to read as follows 2) Net premium receipts or consideration received means gross premiums or consideration received, beginning January 1, 1998, not including that portion of the business of the Teachers Insurance Annuity Association-College Retirement Equities Fund which is attributable to pension business, less the sum of the following A) Premiums received for reinsurance assumed and premiums or consideration returned on policies or contracts canceled or not taken; and B) Dividends paid in cash or used by the policyholders in payment of renewal premiums b) Section 3 is amended to read as follows Sec. 3. Fiscal impact statement The estimated revenue impact of conformity to the income and deduction provisions of the Taxpayer Relief Act of 1997, approved August 5, 1997 (P.L. 105-34; 111 Star. 788 Taxpayer Relief Act is noted below for each of the fiscal years from 1998 through 2002. The revenue impact is relatively small and is offset by the administrative savings and taxpayer convenience. Failure to conform with the federal income and deduction changes in the Taxpayer Relief Act will require the District of Columbia to create new tax forms, change audit and collection procedures and require taxpayers to keep separate records for the District of Columbia and the federal individual income tax The revenue estimates summarized and explained below are based on more than one methodology. The primary basis for District estimates is the federal data provided in the Conference Report on Taxpayer Relief Act. Supplemental data when available was also utilized in estimating the revenue impact of the Taxpayer Relief Act. Section 47-2608 9 ENROLLED ORIGINAL REVENUE IMPACT OF CONFORMITY TO TAXPAYER RELIEF ACT OF 1997 (Fiscal year amounts in thousands of dollars) Tax Type 1998 1999 2000 2001 2002 TOTAL (’98-’02) Individual (912 1,347 1,343 1,961 2,643 8,206) Income Franchise (1,401 972 639 459 422 3,893) Tax Conformity (2,313 2,319 1,982 2,420 3,065 12,099) Impact (Direct Estate Tax (313 624 840 936 1,128 3,841) Impact Cigarette 0 0 (284 275 402 961) Tax Impact Total (2,626 2,943 3,106 3,631 4,595 16,901) Impact Impact of adopting conformity to income and deduction items related to franchise and individual income taxes. Includes estate tax and cigarette tax impacts, which would be reflected in revenue estimate revisions, but are not directly associated with passage of conformity legislation There are two provisions of the 1997 federal tax law change that are not technically conformity issues, but which will have an impact on District of Columbia revenues. These are included in the table above The first of these reflects the changes in the federal estate tax included in the Taxpayer Relief Act. The major change in the federal estate tax is a gradual increase in the unified credit from the current $600,000 to $1,000,000 by the year 2006. The District of Columbia estate tax is based on the state tax credit, which is part of the federal estate tax return. The changes in the federal estate tax in the Taxpayer Relief Act will affect the state tax credit and will have an impact on the District’s estate tax collections. According to the Virginia Tax Department, which taxes estates in the same manner as the District of Columbia, the federal provisions will result in an estimated tax reduction of 1.3% in FY 1998 rising to an estimated 4.7% loss in FY 2002. If the District were to suffer similar losses the loss in revenue from the estate tax would be $313,000 in 10 ENROLLED ORIGINAL FY 1998 rising to $1.1 million by 2002 The Balanced Budget Act of 1997, approved August 5, 1991 (Public Law 105-33; 111 Stat. 251 Balanced Budget Act became law the same time as the Taxpayer Relief Act. One provision of the Balanced Budget Act will increase the federal cigarette tax from its current level of 24 cents per pack to 34 cents, effective January 1, 2000, and to 39 cents effective January 1, 2002. These increases will affect District of Columbia cigarette consumption and will reduce cigarette tax revenues after FY 1999. Based on data from the Federation of Tax Administrators there is a -0.4 elasticity with regard to the impact of cigarette price increases on cigarette consumption. Thus, if cigarette prices rise 10 smoking should decline by 4 10% x 4 4 Based on current cigarette prices in the District and using the -0.4 elasticity provides the following: Current average D.C. cigarette price per pack: Percent price increase due to 10 cent federal tax rate increase In the year 2000 from current price Estimated percentage consumption change in 2000 from Current levels due to federal tax rate increase Impact on cigarette tax estimate for year 2000: 2001: Percent price increase due to additional 5 cent federal Tax rate increase in the year 2002 from current level Estimated percentage consumption change in 2002: From current levels due to federal tax rate increase Impact on cigarette tax estimate for year 2002 2.33 4.29 1.72 284,OOO 275,OO0 6.44 2.58 4O2,00O "The revenue impacts noted above for both the estate tax and the cigarette tax were reflected in the January 1998 revised revenue estimates prepared by the Office of Tax and Revenue. These revenue losses will occur independently of any decision concerning conformity with federal income and deduction provisions The estimated revenue impact of conformity noted above does not include increased revenues due to enhanced economic activity caused by provisions of the Taxpayer Relief Act. There are several provisions, which could generate such economic activity. These include the changes in the capital gains tax rates, the provision that exempts the first $500,000 in capital gains from sale of a home from the income tax and other provisions which will likely have some revenue impact Also included in proposals which may increase economic activity are the various District of Columbia tax incentives included in the Taxpayer Relief Act. These incentives are designed to stimulate economic activity in the District of Columbia. The estimates included in this analysis 11 ENROLLED ORIGINAL assume no increase in economic activity from these provisions. Rather, the increased economic activity will be reflected in revised revenue estimates over the period of the incentives Section 2(b) of D.C. Act 12-371, the District of Columbia Tax Conformity Amendment Act of 1998, technically amends D.C. Code § 47-2608(a)(2) to preserve the existing exemption for the Teacher’s Insurance and Annuity Association-College Retirement Equities Fund TIAA Currently, D.C. Code § 47-2608(a)(2) exempts TIAA by reference to a provision in the Tax Reform Act of 1986 which is set to expire. This legislation simply adopts the description of TIAA that was provided in the Tax Reform Act of 1986. Consequently, the amendment to section 2(b) of Act 12- 371 will have no fiscal impact Sec. 301. Effective date. This act shall take effect following approval by the Mayor (or in the event of veto by the Mayor, action by the Council to override the veto approval by the Financial Responsibility and Management Assistance Authority as provided in section 203(a) of the District of Columbia Financial Responsibility and Management Assistance Act of 1995, approved April 17, 1995 (109 Star. 116; D.C.
