Sections 1-1188.8 1-1188.12 Sec. 4. Section 705 of the District of Columbia Revenue Act of 1970, approved January 5, 1971 (84 Stat. 1939; D.C. Code § 1-336 is amended as follows a) Subsection (d) is amended by striking the phrase "The Mayor" and inserting the phrase "Except as provided in subsection (d-1) of this section, the Mayor" in its place b) A new subsection (d-l) is added to read as follows d-l) Notwithstanding subsection (d amp;this section, the proposed resolution of approval with respect to any lease which is required to be approved by the Council pursuant to subsection (c) of this section, and which is negotiated on behalf of the District by duly licensed commercial real estate brokers pursuant to tenant representative services contracts then in effect between the District and such brokers, shall be transmitted to the Council for a review period of 15 calendar days. If the Council takes no action to approve or disapprove the proposed resolution within the 15-day period, the proposed resolution shall be deemed approved c) Subsection (h) is amended by designating the existing text as paragraph (1) and by Section 1-336 18 ENROLLED ORIGINAL adding a new paragraph (2) to read as follows 2) Notwithstanding paragraph (1) of this subsection, the Mayor may acquire a new leasehold interest in any building that is proposed to be leased for the predominant use of rentable space by, or constructed for lease to and for predominant use of rentable space by, the District government without regard to sections 303 and 304 of the District of Columbia Procurement Practices Act of 1985, effective February 21, 1986 (D.C. Law 6-85; D.C. Code §§ 1-1183.3 and 1-1183.4 provided, that such leasehold interest is acquired pursuant to a lease negotiated on behalf of the District by a duly licensed commercial real estate broker pursuant to a tenant representative services contract then in effect between the District and the broker Sec. 5. Fiscal impact statement. The Council projects a positive fiscal impact for Bill 12-363. Section 2 establishes strong penalties to deter and punish fraudulent claims. It also establishes incentives for District employees to document and report false claims. The dollar value of these incentives cannot be estimated precisely, but it should be substantial in a government that purchases more than $600 million in goods and services annually. In addition, the false claims and qui tam provisions in Section 2 of Bill 12-363 would be essentially self-funding In any case successfully prosecuted by the Corporation Counsel, the violator would have to reimburse the District for the legal costs of the case. In addition, violators would be liable for treble damages and civil penalties of $5,000 to $10,000 for each false claim. After the payment of any award to a qui tam plaintiff and the restitution of the actual loss to the agency subject to the false claim, the District would deposit the proceeds into a Antifraud Fund with assets of up to $2 million available to pay for the enforcement of the law by the Corporation Counsel. Any additional funds recovered would be deposited in the District’s General Fund. Section 3 of Bill 12-363 makes only technical changes in the procurement code and would not have a fiscal impact. Section 4 of Bill 12-363 would have a strong and positive fiscal impact, because it would allow the District to renegotiate existing leases to lower rental rates and increase tenant allowances; terminate leases for unused or inefficient space; and consolidate underutilized space through space planning and subletting. Based on different assumptions, the Council estimates that the District should be able to reduce its annual rental cost of approximately $40 million by $2 million to $10 million annually. The lower cost saving figure will be achieved if the District reduces its average per square foot rate by 5 percent. The higher estimate will be achieved if the District reduces the average cost per square foot by 5 percent and reduces the amount of space by 21 percent. The report of the District’s Real Estate Executive Committee, as well as the studies by Arthur Anderson LLP, the consultant hired by the Financial Responsibility and Management Assistance Authority, indicates that these estimates are reasonable. 19 ENROLLED ORIGINAL Sec. 6.
