O, IG[HAL I. SPONSOR: Chairman Cropp at the request of the Mayor 2. BILL: No. 12-616 3. TITLE: 4. OVERVIEW: Equal Opportunity for Local, Small, and Disadvantaged Business Enterprises Amendment Act of 1998 This legislation would provide guidelines for use by District government agencies in awarding or doing business with small, local or disadvantaged businesses. It establishes a three-year assessment by the Council, based on information received from the District of Columbia Local Business Opportunity Commission Commission on the need for local, small and disadvantaged business enterpfi~ programs It establishes regulations, bid preference mechanisms set aside programs and contract participation guidelines for local, disadvantaged and small business enterprise contractors. It establishes criteria for certifying firms. Finally, it establishes procedures and guidelines for actions of the Commission and authorizes telephone participation in meetings by members of the Commission. 5. FISCAL IMPACT: A. Summary The legislation provides for an increase in the average annualized gross receipts a business may have and still meet the threshold to become certified. This will likely result in more businesses becoming certified as a local, small or disadvantaged business. In FY 1997, the District paid approximately $10.2 million more for goods and services than it would have been the ease in the absence of the preferences provided by this bill. The Office of Local Business Development Administration, the agency that implements the Districts preference system, states that benefits resulting from preferences justify the $10.2 million cost. The Off’ice of Tax and Revenue is unable to quantify the actual benefits received by the District as a result of the set-aside program. Office of the Chief Financial Officer Office of Budget and Planning EHP, OLLED OP, IGIHAL B. Expenditure Statement The Chief Procurement Officer CPO has indicated that the average percentage Price reduction received by an LSBDE supplier is 7 Human Rights and Economic Development has indicated total district-wide contracts awarded are projected to be $67,000,000 in FY 1998 based on third quarter figures. Projections for FY 1999 and the two out-years of FY 2000 and FY 2001 cannot be quantified. The CPO has indicated that over $145,000,000 in purchases were made from LSD’s in FY 1997. The District has no other historical data. However, as an example one might conservatively adopt the CPO’s figure and assume a five million-dollar increase in contract awards to LSDBE’s per year. Over a three-year period of time, the expenditure impact would be $31,500,000 as seen below. This figure represents what the District might spend over and above a contracting process not subject to the proposed legislation. Example Fiscal Year FY1999 FY 2000 FY 2001 Total C~ntract $145,000,000 $150,000,000 $155,000,000 Dollars Set-aside 7% 7% 7% Percentage Expenditure $10,150,000 $10,500,000 $10,850,000 Impact C. Revenue Statement This legislation, as written, is not expected to have an impact on revenues. Over time, a set-aside program would result in increased District revenues if, relative to firms that would otherwise be awarded contracts, set-aside firms are owned by District residents, hire District residents, buy from District suppliers, or contribute to the creation of "critical mass" of firms that will further stimulate the economy. The studies of set-aside firms that have been done indicate that the firms have hired a majority of their staff for city projects from the District of Columbia. They have also made use of the District’s merchants and service providers to support activities pertaining to the completion of District contracts. However, the revenue impact from the set-aside program cannot be quantified.
