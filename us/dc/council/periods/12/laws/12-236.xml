Code § 1-233(c)(3 For section 2(e) of this act, the Council adopts the fiscal impact statement dated November 10, 1998, prepared by the Office of the Chief Financial Officer which is attached to this act.

SPONSOR: Councilmember Sharon Ambrose 2. ACT: No Number 3. TITLE: Shakespeare Theatre Property Tax Amendment to Bill 12-706 4. OVERVIEW: The Shakespeare Theatre acquired an apartment building located at 311 East Capital Street, NE for the purpose of housing paid professional guest artists. The Shakespeare Theatre has been paying annual property taxes on the apartment. The theatre is seeking relief from this tax burden. 5. FISCAL IMPACT: A. Summary_ There is no expenditure impact associated with the provisions of the Amendment. There is a negative revenue impact of $32,700 in FY 1999 and $49,800 over four years. B. Expenditure Statement There is no expenditure impact associated with the provisions of the Amendment. C. Revenue Statement There are two components of direct revenue impact from the proposed legislation. The Amendment to Bill 12-706 would grant retroactive tax exemption status to the Class 2 property at 311 East Capitol Street, NE (Square 787, Lot 814) owned by the Shakespeare Theatre. First, there is the revenue loss from refunding taxes already paid. Second, there is the revenue loss for future taxes that would not be collected. Also, there may be an indirect cost in the form of requests from other taxpayers who desire the same exemption status for similar residential properties used to support theatrical activities. Office of the Chief Financial Officer Office of Budget and Planning ENROLLED ORIGINAL The D.C. Code does not currently provide for exemptions from real property taxes concerning residences of theatre companies. In addition the amendment might create a potentially discriminatory impact since it does not apply to all similarly situated taxpayers. The new fiscal year 1999 assessment under the triennial assessment process remains unchanged since fiscal year 1995. Since the currently available information indicates there will be no significant increases in property values within that area in the near future, roughly $5,700 per year represents a reasonable estimate of the future revenue loss from this proposed legislation. The revenue loss from refunding real property taxes paid from August 1, 1995 to present will be approximately $27,000. The available data does not provide a basis for estimating the indirect loss due to requests for tax exemption for other taxpayers.
