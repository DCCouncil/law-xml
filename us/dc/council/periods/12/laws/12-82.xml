Law 11-212; D.C. Code § 32-261.1 et seq Sec. 3. Fiscal impact statement. The fiscal impact of Bill 12-366 will be positive. The legislation supports the centralization of procurement functions under the Chief Procurement Officer, as recommended by the Procurement Task Force of the Committee on Government Operations, and by Pegasus/Langford, the consultants hired by the District of Columbia Financial Responsibility and Management Assistance Authority to advise the District on procurement policy and practices. Both the Procurement Task Force and Pegasus/Langford concluded that centralization saves money, improves the quality of procurement, and promotes accountability. In particular, centralization can yield significant cost reductions through bulk purchases of goods and services used by multiple agencies. Pegasus/Langford estimated that common purchases of goods and services, which is only one of the benefits of centralization, could save the District $5.2 million annually. This projection is based on a conservative estimate ofa 2 percent cost reduction in the District’s annual spending of $260 million for goods and services needed by multiple agencies. Sec. 4. This act shall take effect following approval by the Mayor (or in the event of veto by the Mayor, action by the Council to override the veto approval by the Financial Responsibility and Management Assistance Authority as provided in section 203(a) of the District of Columbia Financial Responsibility and Management Assistance Authority Act of 1995, approved April 17, 1995 (109 Stat. 116; D.C.
