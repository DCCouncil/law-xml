This title may be cited as the "Procurement Practices Streamlining Amendment Act of 1998 Sec. 402. Sections 105 and 302 of the District of Columbia Procurement Practices Act of 1985, effective February 21, 1986 (D.C. Law 6-85; D.C. Code §§ 1-1181.5 and 1-1183.2 are amended as follows a) Section 105 (D.C. Code § 1-1181.5) is amended as follows 1) The last sentence of subsection (a) is amended to read as follows The CPO may delegate contracting authority to employees of a department, agency, or other entity commensurate with the CPO’s judgment of each employee’s ability to meet the objective of this act.

Fiscal impact statement. This title will have a positive fiscal impact. First, it will eliminate the requirement that the CPO make changes in the contracting authority of employees of a department or agency by issuing a regulation, a cumbersome and time-consuming process that must be initiated on an almost continuous basis. Instead, the legislation requires the CPO to specify contracting authority in writing and to inform the Mayor, Council, and the Inspector General of these delegations. Second, the legislation authorizes the CPO to conduct a pre-qualification process that certifies the financial and professional capability of prospective bidders. Although the fiscal impact of pre-qualification is impossible to quantify, it can only increase the quality of District procurements by screening out unqualified bidders. TITLE V CHIEF INFORMATION OFFICER REPEAL Sec. 501. Short title. This title may be cited as the "Chief Information Officer Repeal Act of 1998 Sec. 502. Section 801 of the Budget Support Act of 1995, effective March 5, 1996 (D.C. Law 11-98; D.C. Code § 1-1182.9 is repealed. Sec. 503. Fiscal impact statement. This title will have no fiscal impact.

This title may be cited as the "Special Education Assessment and Placement Act of 1998 Sec. 602 a) The District of Columbia Board of Education Board or its successor, and the District of Columbia Public Schools DCPS shall assess or evaluate a student, who may have a disability and who may require special education services, within 60 days from the date that the student was referred for an evaluation or assessment. Section 1-1182.9 Note, New Section 31-1861 New Section 31-1861 ENROLLED ORIGINAL (b) If a student is classified as having a disability, as defined in section 101 (a)(1) of the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act, approved April 13, 1970 (84 Stat. 175; 20 U.S.C. § 1401 (a)(1 or in section 7(8) of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, approved September 26, 1973 (87 Stat. 359; 29 U.S.C. § 706(8 the Board and DCPS shall place that student in an appropriate public, private, or residential placement within 60 days from the date that the evaluation or assessment was completed. Sec. 603. Fiscal impact statement. Enactment of this title will have no negative fiscal impact on the expenditures of the District and could have a positive fiscal impact. Currently, DCPS has 50 days to evaluate and place a student who needs special education services. Because the proposed language only extends the time frame for assessment and placement from 50 to 120 days, there is no need to hire additional staff or purchase additional resources to implement the extension. However, the extension in time increases the possibility that DCPS will complete assessments and placements within the required time frame and thereby avoid imposition of fines for noncompliance. Sec. 604. Applicability. This title shall apNy upon the enactment by the United States Congress of legislation authorizing 120 days for the Board of Education and the District of Columbia Public Schools to assess and place special education students.

The count shall include the information specified in section 2402(b) of the District of Columbia School Reform Act of 1995, approved April 26, 1996 (110 Stat. 13211257]; D.C.

Note, New Section 31-1861 Note, New Section 31-2853.42a New Section 31-2853.42a ENROLLED ORIGINAL Sec. 703. Fiscal impact statement.

Law 6-85; D.C. Code § 1-1181.1 et seq shall include in the solicitation a description of the contractor’s rights and responsibilities under the act 1B) Paragraphs (1) and (1A) of this subsection shall apply to claims arising after the effective date of the Quick Payment Amendment Act of 1998 b) Section 5 (D.C.

Fiscal impact statement. The fiscal impact of this title will be positive. Because current law does not include a time limit on quick payment claims, the District is liable for claims dating back to March 15, 1985, when the District of Columbia Government Quick Payment Act of 1984 took effect. This Section 1-1174 10 ENROLLED ORIGINAL title would create deadli.~es for filing quick payment claims, enabling the District to cap this liability while still giving vendors sufficient time to file their claims. The amount of the potential liability for quick payment claims is not known. In fiscal year 1997, the District paid a total of $386,000 in interest penalties on total vendor payments approaching $1.9 billion. Nevertheless, the District’s potential liability for late payments dating back to 1985 could amount to $1 billion or more. In its Fiscal Year 1997 "Report on Compliance and On Internal Control Over Financial Reporting KPMG Peat Marwick LLP sampled 104 invoices and found that 70 were not paid on time. The District has routinely failed to pay vendors on time for years and therefore the potential liability for quick payment claims is undoubtedly quite large.

This title may be cited as the "Use of Trained Employees to Administer Medication Act of 1998 Sec. 1002.
