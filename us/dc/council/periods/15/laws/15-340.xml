AN ACT IN THE COUNCIL OF THE DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA To require the Public Service Commission to implement a renewable energy portfolio standard through which a fixed percentage of electric provider’s supply source would be from renewable energy; require the standard to be met by the obtaining renewable energy credits; require the Public Service Commission to adopt regulations governing the application and transfer of credits and implementation of this act; provide for the eligibility of energy from specified sources; require electricity suppliers to submit an annual compliance report to the Public Service Commission which demonstrates an electricity supplier’s compliance with the renewable energy portfolio standard or the amount of electricity sales by which the electricity supplier failed to meet the applicable renewable energy portfolio standard; require electricity suppliers to pay compliance fees for failure to comply with the renewable energy portfolio standard; provide for the recovery of fees and costs associated with complying with the renewable energy portfolio standard; establish a Renewable Energy Development Fund to be administered by the District of Columbia Energy Office; require the Public Service Commission to facilitate a renewable electricity tracking system; require the Public Service Commission to report to the Council each year on the status of implementation of this act; and require the Public Service Commission to establish standards to account for customer generation from eligible renewable resources for compliance with the renewable energy portfolio standard. BE IT ENACTED, BY THE COUNCIL OF THE DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA, That this act be cited as the “Renewable Energy Portfolio Standard Act of 2004 Sec. 2. The Council of the District of Columbia finds that 1) It is in the public interest to recognize the economic, environmental, fuel diversity, and security benefits of renewable energy resources, to establish a market for electricity from these resources in the District of Columbia, and to lower the cost to consumers of electricity produced from these resources 2) It is in the public interest to ensure that the benefits of electricity from renewable energy resources, including long-term decreased emissions and reliance on and vulnerability from imported energy sources, increased energy security and economic development, and a healthier environment, accrue to the public at large 3) Electricity suppliers and consumers share an obligation to develop a minimum level of these resources in the electricity supply portfolio of the District of Columbia.
