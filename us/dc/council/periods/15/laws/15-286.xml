AN ACT IN THE COUNCIL OF THE DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA To amend the National Capital Revitalization Corporation Act of 1998 to authorize the National Capital Revitalization Corporation or the RLA Revitalization Corporation to exercise eminent domain at the Skyland Shopping Center, and to clarify the circumstances and procedures by which the National Capital Revitalization Corporation otherwise may exercise its eminent domain authority. BE IT ENACTED BY THE COUNCIL OF THE DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA, That this act may be cited as the “National Capital Revitalization Corporation Eminent Domain Clarification and Skyland Eminent Domain Approval Amendment Act of 2004”. Sec. 2. Eminent domain authorization for Skyland Shopping Center redevelopment project a) The Council finds the following 1) The communities east of the Anacostia River, including the areas near the Skyland Shopping Center, have lagged behind other communities in the District in economic development and have the highest unemployment rates in the District 2) Wards 7 and 8 including the neighborhoods surrounding the Skyland Shopping Center remain economically depressed and underserved by the amenities enjoyed by the rest of the District and nearby Maryland 3) One of the key reasons why these areas lag behind is because certain critical commercial locations are run down or blighted 4) The Skyland Shopping Center is a blighting factor in the Hillcrest and nearby communities 5) The Skyland Shopping Center is characterized by underused, neglected, and poorly maintained properties 6) These poor conditions of the Skyland Shopping Center have fueled crime and attracted criminal elements to the site and is likely to have increased the incidence of crime in the surrounding neighborhoods 7) The Skyland Shopping Center has been the site of a significant amount of stray and illegally dumped garbage, which the current owners have not removed in a timely Codification District of Columbia Official Code 2001 Edition 2005 Winter Supp. West Group Publisher ENROLLED ORIGINAL 2Codification District of Columbia Official Code, 2001 Edition West Group Publisher, 1-800-328-9378. manner and which has created an eyesore and nuisance in the community 8) The layout of the current shopping center is unsafe for both motorists and pedestrians 9) The fragmented and often absentee ownership of the properties has exacerbated these problems by allowing individual owners to avoid responsibility for safety and the reduction of crime, trash, and other blighting factors 10) Neither the police nor the community have been able to secure the cooperation of the current owners to deal with the numerous problems at the site despite years of efforts 11) For over 15 years, residents near the shopping center have petitioned the District to become involved in the redevelopment of the area and the correction of conditions at the site 12) The National Capital Revitalization Corporation (“Corporation”) has advised the Council that the Skyland Shopping Center is blighted and that current conditions are an impediment to the economic revitalization of this area of the District 13) The Corporation has proposed a redevelopment of the Skyland Shopping Center that will create hundreds of new jobs, attract businesses that are desired by the community, and stimulate economic activity east the Anacostia River 14) The assemblage of the properties comprising the Skyland Shopping Center is necessary to allow for the proposed redevelopment and it is highly unlikely that the properties could be assembled without the involvement of the District government and without the authority to exercise eminent domain by the Corporation 15) The assemblage of the properties comprising the Skyland Shopping Center and the construction of a new shopping center on the site, guided by the policies and requirements of the District government including the Corporation, will further many important public purposes including A) Removal of unsafe and unsanitary conditions B) Reduction of the incidence of crime C) Removal of garbage and other eyesores D) Reorganization and reorientation of the site to make it safer and more attractive E) Expansion of economic opportunities for residents of Wards 7 and 8 F) Provision of needed job opportunities for residents of Wards 7 and 8 G) Provision of needed retail options and other amenities for residents of Wards 7 and 8 H) Revitalization of an economically distressed community; and (I) Increasing and diversifying the tax base of the District 16) The properties listed and described in section 20(c)(1) of the National ENROLLED ORIGINAL 3Codification District of Columbia Official Code, 2001 Edition West Group Publisher, 1-800-328-9378.
