      <summary>BILL SUMMARY - As introduced it increases the alcohol by volume percentage for wine from 15 to 21 percent and allows holders of wine pub and distillery pub permits to ship products directly to District residents. It allows District residents to manufacture beer and wine in their home without a license if it is for personal use and allows pub permit holders to manufacture alcoholic beverages off-site if the production facility is within 600 feet of the licensed premises. </summary>
