      <summary>BILL SUMMARY - As introduced it authorizes fees collected pursuant to the Conversion of Rental Housing to Condominium or Cooperative Status Act of 1980 to be deposited in the Housing Production Trust Fund.  It requires a fee be paid to the Mayor if an owner reduces the number of units in an accommodation with 10 or less units.  Among other things it provides for damages when a housing provider repossesses a rental unit from a tenant in order to personally use and occupy or sell a housing unit for personal use and occupancy and subsequently receives rent within the following 12-month period. </summary>
