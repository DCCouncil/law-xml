      <summary>BILL SUMMARY - As introduced Bill 23-416 adds provisions to the Comprehensive Newborn Screening Program to establish discharge standards and authorizes penalties for failure to comply with the standards or perform the necessary screens. It would also authorize the Department of Health to collect information from hospitals and birthing facilities to create a report card regarding compliance with newborn screening requirements, lactation support services, parent education, discharge standards, and clinical quality measures.  It also creates a Perinatal and Infant Health Advisory Committee that would advise on ways to reduce preterm birth and newborn screening activities.  </summary>
