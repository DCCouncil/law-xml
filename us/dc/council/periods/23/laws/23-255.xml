      <text>In 2018, there were over 30,000 eviction filings in the Superior Court of the District of Columbia. These filings represent over 17,000 unique households in the District, most of which were concentrated in Wards 7 and 8.</text>
    </para>
    <para>
      <num>(b)</num>
      <text>Just 10 housing providers were responsible for 40% of all eviction filings in the District, and around 50% of all filings in the District were for less than $1,000 in rent owed.</text>
    </para>
    <para>
      <num>(c)</num>
      <text>A vast majority of these filings did not result in a judgment against the tenant. The Superior Court has reported 1,600 executed evictions annually from 2014 through 2018.</text>
    </para>
    <para>
      <num>(d)</num>
      <text>Even when an eviction filing does not result in a judgment against the tenant, the tenant may experience adverse effects associated with the eviction proceeding itself, and the presence of an eviction filing on the tenant's record.</text>
    </para>
    <para>
      <num>(e)</num>
      <text>Currently, the filing fee for an eviction action in the Landlord-Tenant Branch of the Superior Court is only $15. In most larger jurisdictions across the country, filing fees range from $50 to nearly $200. In Virginia, filing fees for eviction cases are anywhere from $120 to nearly $350.</text>
    </para>
    <para>
      <num>(f)</num>
      <text>Emerging research is finding that filing fees can deter housing providers from filing frivolous cases in Superior Court. A recent study, published in Housing Studies, found that all else being equal, neighborhoods in states with higher eviction filing fees had fewer serial filings (Housing Studies, Dan Immergluck, <em>et al.</em>, (Vol. 35, 2020)).</text>
    </para>
    <para>
      <num>(g)</num>
      <text>It is the sense of the Council that the Superior Court should raise filing fees for eviction cases to $100 so that serial filers seeking small sums of money from their tenants are deterred from using eviction filings as a mechanism to collect rent from their tenants.</text>
