      <summary>BILL SUMMARY - As introduced Bill 23-506 requires a plan for comprehensive organics site management and recycling infrastructure. Among other things it requires a uniform recycling labeling scheme, requires waste collectors to address contamination in recyclables and compostables and requires the Mayor to impose a surcharge on recycling disposed of at District transfer stations when they exceed a contamination threshold. It establishes additional standards regarding the use of compostable disposable food service ware such as requiring the use of reusable food service ware when providing food for consumption. It also establishes a reuse and donation program to reduce waste in landfills and incinerators. </summary>
