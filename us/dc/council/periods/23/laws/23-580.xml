      <summary>BILL SUMMARY - As introduced Bill 23-665 requires the Department of General Services (DGS) to identify and mitigate environmental hazards that impact human health on playground surface materials as well as all District-owned buildings that are occupied during demolition, excavation, renovation, and construction activities. DGS must publish plans for remediation where an environmental hazard is identified among other things.  </summary>
