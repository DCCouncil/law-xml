      <summary>BILL SUMMARY - As introduced the bill requires 10 days' notice regarding statements about regulating vehicular or pedestrian traffic, if the proposed installation, modification, or removal of the statement will increase safety at a location identified as a high-risk intersection in the Multimodal Long-Range Transportation Plan.  It requires the Mayor to install sidewalks on both sides of a street, to connect new sidewalks to existing sidewalks and to mark unmarked crosswalks. It provides that the Department of Transportation (DDOT) not issue public space permits for certain projects unless the plans include installing new sidewalks, bicycle lanes or cycle tracks, or marked crosswalks and the applicant has met the requirements of previous permits and returned crosswalks and bicycle lanes to their pre-construction condition.  It also requires that DDOT make certain information publicly available and easily searchable, and issue reports on how projects or recommendations increase transportation safety and provide equitable access to safety goals. Among other things, it requires Council approval of the Multimodal Long-Range Transportation Plan. </summary>
