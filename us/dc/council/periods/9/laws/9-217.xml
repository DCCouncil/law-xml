The Council of the District of Columbia hereby gives notice that the 3~-day Congressional Review Period has expired, and therefore, cites this enactment as D.C. Law 9-217, effective March 17, 1993 f~ a i r~e Council Dates Counted During the 30-da~on~qressional Review Period: January 20,21,22,25,26,27 February 2,3,4,16,17,18,19,22,23,24,25,26 March 1,2,3,4,5,8,9,10,11,12,15,16 Enrolled Original AN ACT Oistr of Columbl Code D,C, ACT 9-347 $995 Supptement) New Subchapter IIA, Chapter 11, Title I IN THE COUNCIL OF THE DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA DECEMBER 29, 1992 To establish, a 50~ goal for District government contracts with local small business enterprises and to provide a preference for local and disadvantaged business enterprises in all available areas of District government contracting. BE~ IT ENACTED BY THE COUNCIL OF THE DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA, That this act may be cited as the "Equal Opportunity for Local, Small, and Disadvantaged Business Enterprises Act of 1992 See. 2. Findings. The Council of the District of Columbia finds that 1) It is the policy of the government of the District of Columbia District to ensure full and equitable opportunities for small and disadvantaged business enterprises to participate as prime contractors, subcontractors, and joint venture partners in the award of contracts for construction, supplies, and services by the government of the District 2) The District’s public contracting process should be used to stimulate new employment opportunities for District residents, to assist in the development of existing District businesses, and to encourage businesses to locate and remain in the District 3) Programs that enhance the business opportunities and entrepreneurial skills of small business enterprises, disadvantaged business enterprises, and local business enterprises will serve the public interest because the growth and development of such businesses will expand the tax base of the District, will increase employment and job training, will have other positive effects on the economic health of the District, and will serve to g~ve more District residents a stake in our community 4) Significant numbers of small business enterprises, disadvantaged business enterprises, and local business enterprises have attempted to participate in the District’s procurement process. While the level of such participation is the product of the District’s considerable outreach efforts, it is clear that outreach efforts alone will not result in more such businesses actually being awarded contracts for construction, supplies, and services by the governlnent of the District 5) A preference mechanism for bids submitted by local business enterprises and disadvantaged businesses will further the public policy of the District by facilitating the participation of such businesses New, Section 1-1152 Enrolled Original in the District’s procurement process. The bid preference mechanism will not exclude any prospective contractors, l~ather, it will promote competition for District contracts and assist local and disadvantaged businesses in obtaining District contracts. The bid preference mechanism will also be applicable to joint ventures between local business enterprises and either disadvantaged businesses and non-local or non-disadvantaged businesses. The application of the bid preference mechanism to joint ventures will encourage the participation of local businesses and disadvantaged businesses as joint venture partners or subcontractors in the bids and proposals of businesses that are not local or disadvantaged businesses 6) Set-asides of District contracts for small business enterprises, where competition for such contracts will be limited to small business enterprises, are a means of achieving the public policy objective of promoting the growth and development of District-based small businesses 7) Limitations on access to bonding and insurance have impeded the efforts of small, local, and disadvantaged businesses to participate in District government contracting and it is in the interest of the District to waive requirements, when advisable, for smaI1, local, and disadvantaged businesses 8) The small business, local business, and disadvantaged business programs established according to this act will work to achieve the public policy objectives of promoting the growth and development of such businesses and promoting the overall economic health of the District.
