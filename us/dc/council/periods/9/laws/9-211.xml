Code § 1-2512 is amended by adding a new subsection (c) to read as follows c) Accommodation for religious observance 1) It shall further be an unlawful discriminatory practice for an employer to refuse to make a reasonable accommodation for an employee’s religious observance by permitting the employee to make up work time lost due to such observance, unless such an accommodation would cause the employer undue hardship. An accommodation would cause an employer undue hardship when it would cause the employer to incur more than de minimis costs 2) Such an accommodation may be made by permitting the employee to work A) During the employee’s scheduled lunch time or other work breaks B) Before or after the employee’s usual working hours C) Outside of the employer’s normal business hours D) During the employee’s paid vacation days E) During another employee’s working hours as part of a voluntary swap with such other employee; or F) In any other manner that is mutually agreeable to the employer and employee 3) When an employee’s request for a particular form of accommodation would cause undue hardship to the employer, the employer shall reasonably accommodate the employee in a manner that does not cause undue hardship to the employer. Where other means of accommodation would cause undue hardship to the employer, an employee shall have the option of taking leave without pay if granting leave without pay would not cause undue hardship to the employer 4) An employee shall notify the employer of the need for an accommodation at least 10 working days prior to the day or days for Section 1-2512 Enrolled Original which the accommodation is needed, unless the need for the accommodation cannot reasonably be foreseen 5) In any proceeding brought under this section, the employer shall have the burden of establishing that it would be unable reasonably to accommodate an employee’s religious observance without incurring an undue hardship, provided, however, that in the case of an employer that employs more than 5 but fewer than 15 full-time employees, or where accommodation of an employee’s observance of a religious practice would require the employee to take more than 3 consecutive days off from work, the employee shall have the burden of establishing that the employer could reasonably accommodate the employee’s religious observance without incurring an undue hardship; and provided further, that it shall be considered an undue hardship if an employer would be required to pay any additional compensation to an employee by reason of an accommodation for an employee’s religious observance. The mere assumption that other employees with the same religious beliefs might also request accommodation shall not be considered evidence of undue hardship. An employer that employs 5 or fewer full-time employees shall be exempt from the provisions of this subsection Sec. 3. Effective date.
