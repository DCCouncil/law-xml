Course of performance or practical construction a) If a lease contract involves repeated occasions for performance by either party with knowledge of the nature of the performance and opportunity for objection to it by the other, any course of performance accepted or acquiesced in without objection is relevant to determine the meaning of the lease agreement b) The express terms of a lease agreement and any course of performance, as well as any course of dealing and usage of trade, must be construed whenever reasonable as consistent with each other; but if that construction is unreasonable, express terms control course of performance, course of performance controls both course of dealing and usage of trade, and course of dealing controls usage of trade c) Subject to the provisions of §28:2A-208 on modification and waiver, course of performance is relevant to show a waiver or modification of any term inconsistent with the course of performance §28:2A-208.

Lessee under finance lease as beneficiary of supply contract a) The benefit of a supplier’s promises to the lessor under the supply contract and of all warranties, whether express or implied, including those of any third party provided in connection with or as part the supply contract, extends to the lessee to the extent of the lessee’s leasehold interest under a finance lease related to the supply contract, but is subject to the terms of the warranty and of the supply contract and all defenses or claims arising therefrom b) The extension of the benefit a supplier’s promises and of warranties to the lessee (§28:2A-209(1 does not 1) Modify the rights and obligations of the parties to the supply contract, whether arising therefrom or otherwise; or 2) Impose any duty or liability under the supply contract on the lessee c) Any modification or rescission of the supply contract by the supplier and the lessor is effective between the supplier and the lessee unless, before the modification or rescission, the supplier has received notice that the lessee has entered into a finance lease related to the New Sec. 28:2A-207 New Sec 28:2A-208 New Sec. 28:2A-209 10 Enrolled Original supply contract. If the modification or rescission is effective between the supplier and the lessee, the lessor is deemed to have assumed, in addition to the obligations of the lessor to the lessee under the lease contract, promises of the supplier to the lessor and warranties that were so modified or rescinded as they existed and were available to the lessee before modification or rescission d) In addition to the extension of the benefit of the supplier~s promises and of warranties to the lessee under subsection (a) of this section, the lessee retains all rights that the lessee may have against the supplier which arise from an agreement between the lessee and the supplier or under other law §28:2A-210. Express warranties a) Express warranties by the lessor are created as follows 1) Any affirmation of fact or promise made by the lessor to the lessee which relates to the goods and becomes part of the basis of the bargain creates an express warranty that the goods will conform to the affirmation or promise 2) Any description of the goods which is made part of the basis of the bargain creates an express warranty that the goods will conform to the description 3) Any sample or model that is made part of the basis of the bargain creates an express warranty that the whole of the goods will conform to the sample or model b) It is not necessary to the creation of an express warranty that the lessor use formal words, such as "warrant" or "guarantee or that the lessor have a specific intention to make a warranty, but an affirmation merely of the value of the goods or a statement purporting to be merely the lessor~s opinion or commendation of the goods does not create a warranty §28 2A-211. Warranties against interference and against infringement; lessee~s obligation against infringement a) There is in a lease contract a warranty that for the lease term no person holds a claim to or interest in the goods that arose from an act or omission of the lessor, other than a claim by way of infringement or the like, which will interfere with the lessee~s enjoyment of its leasehold interest b) Except in a finance lease there is in a lease contract by a lessor who is a merchant regularly dealing in goods of the kind a warranty that the goods are delivered free of the rightful claim of any person by way of infringement or the like c) A lessee who furnishes specifications to a lessor or a supplier shall hold the lessor and the suppIier harmless against any claim by way of infringement or the like that arises out of compliance with the specifications §28: 2A-212. Implied warranty of merchantability a) Except in a finance lease, a warranty that the goods will be merchantable is implied in a lease contract if the lessor is a merchant with respect to goods of that kind b) Goods to be merchantable must I) Pass without objection in the trade under the description in the lease agreement 2) In the case of fungible goods, be of fair average quality within the description; New Sec. 28: 2A- 2~0 New Sec. 28:2A-211 New Sec. 28:2A-212 11 Enrolled Original 3) Be fit for the ordinary purposes for which goods of that type are used 4) Run, within the variation permitted by the lease agreement, of even kind, quality, and quantity withineach unit and among all units involved 5) Be adequately contained, packaged, and labeled as the lease agreement may require; and 6) Conform to any promises or affirmations of fact made on the container or label c) Other implied warranties may arise from course of dealing or usage of trade §28:2A-213. Implied warranty of fitness for particular purpose Except in a finance lease, if the lessor at the time the lease contract is made has reason to know of any particular purpose for which the goods are required and that the lessee is relying on the lessor~s skill or judgment to select or furnish suitable goods, there is in the lease contract an implied warranty that the goods will be fit for that purpose §28:2A-214. Exclusion or modification of warranties a) Words or conduct relevant to the creation of an express warranty and words or conduct tending to negate or limit a warranty must be construed wherever reasonable as consistent with each other; but, subject to the provisions of §28:2A-202 on parol or extrinsic evidence, negation or limitation is inoperative to the extent that the construction is unreasonable b) Subject to subsection (c) of this ~ection, to exclude or modify the implied warranty of merchantability or any part of it the language must mention "merchantability be by a writing, and be conspicuous. Subject to subsection (c) of this section, to exclude or modify any implied warranty of fitness the exclusion must be by a writing and be conspicuous. Language to exclude all implied warranties of fitness is sufficient if it is in writing, is conspicuous and states, for example There is no warranty that the goods will be fit for a particular purpose c) Notwithstanding subsection (b) of this section, but subject to subsection (d) of this section 1) Unless the circumstances indicate otherwise, all implied warranties are excluded by expressions like "as is or "with all faults or by other language that in common understanding calls the lesseers attention to the exclusion of warranties and makes plain that there is no implied warranty, if in writing and conspicuous 2) If the lessee before entering into the lease contract has examined the goods or the sample or model as fully as desired or has refused to examine the goods, there is no implied warranty with regard to defects that an examination ought in the circumstances to have revealed; and 3) An implied warranty may also be excluded or modified by course of dealing, course of performance, or usage of trade d) To exclude or modify a warranty against interference or against infringement (§28:2A-211) or any part of it, the language must be specific, be by a writing, and be conspicuous, unless the circumstances, including course of performance, course of dealing, or usage of trade, give the lessee reason to know that the goods are being leased subject to a claim or interest of any person.

Cumulation and conflict of warranties express or implied Warranties, whether express or implied, must be construed as consistent with each other and as cumulative, but if that construction is unreasonable, the intention of the parties determines which warranty is dominant. In ascertaining that intention the following rules apply 1) Exact or technical specifications displace an inconsistent sample or model or general language of description 2) A sample from an existing bulk displaces inconsistent general language of description 3) Express warranties displace inconsistent implied warranties other than an implied warranty of fitness for a particular purpose §28:2A-216. Third party beneficiaries of express and implied warranties A warranty to or for the benefit of a lessee under this article, whether express or implied, extends to any person who may reasonably be expected to use, consume, or be affected by the goods and who is injured by breach of the warranty. The operation of this section may not be excluded, modified, or limited with respect to injury to the person of an individual to whom the warranty extends, but an exclusion, modification, or limitation of the warranty, including any with respect to rights and remedies, effective against the lessee is also effective against the beneficiary designated under this section §28 2A- 217. Identification Identification of goods as goods to which a lease contract refers may be made at any time and in any manner explicitly agreed to by the parties. In the absence of explicit agreement, identification occurs 1) When the lease contract is made if the lease contract is for a lease of goods that are existing and identified 2) When the goods are shipped, marked, or otherwise designated by the lessor as goods to which the lease contract refers, if the lease contract is for a lease of goods that are not existing and identified or 3) When the young are conceived, if the lease contract is for a lease of unborn young of animals §28:2A-218. Insurance and proceeds a) A lessee obtains an insurable interest when existing goods are identified to the lease contract even though the goods identified are nonconforming and the lessee has an option to reject them b) If a lessee has an insurable interest only by reason of the lessor’s identification of the goods, the lessor, until default or insolvency or notification to the lessee that identification is final, may substitute other goods for those identified c) Notwithstanding a lessee’s insurable interest under subsections (a) and (b) of this section, the lessor retains an insurable interest until an option to buy has been exercised by the lessee and risk of loss has passed to the lessee d) Nothing in this section impairs any insurable interest recognized under any other statute or rule of law e) The parties by agreement may determine that one or more parties have an obligation to obtain and pay for insurance covering the 13 New Sec. 28:2A-215 New Sec. 28:2A-216 New Sec. 28:2A-217 New Sec. 28:2A-218 Enrolled Original goods and by agreement may determine the beneficiary of the proceeds of the insurance §28:2A-219. l~isk of loss a) Except in the case of a finance lease, risk of loss is retained by the lessor and does not pass to the lessee.

Effect of default on risk of loss a) Where risk of loss is to pass to the lessee and the time of passage is not stated 1) If a tender or delivery of goods so fails to conform to the lease contract as to give a right of rejection, the risk of their loss remains with the lessor, or, in the case of a finance lease, the supplier, until cure or acceptance 2) If the lessee rightfully revokes acceptance, he or she, to the extent of any deficiency in his or her effective insurance coverage, may treat the risk of loss as having remained with the lessor from the beginning b) Whether or not risk of loss is to pass to the lessee, if the lessee as to conforming goods already identified to a lease contract repudiates or is otherwise in default under the lease contract, the lessor, or, in the case of a finance lease, the supplier, to the extent of any deficiency in his or her effective insurance coverage may treat the risk of loss as resting on the lessee for a commercially reasonable time §28:2A-221. Casualty to identified goods If a lease contract requires goods identified when the lease contract is made, and the goods suffer casualty without fault of the lessee, the lessor, or the supplier before delivery, or the goods suffer casualty before risk of loss passes to the lessee pursuant to the lease agreement or §28:2A-219, then 1) If the loss is total, the lease contract is avoided; and 2) If the loss is partial or the goods have so deteriorated as to no longer conform to the lease contract, the lessee may nevertheless demand inspection and at his or her option either treat the lease contract New Sec. 28:2A-219 New Sec. 28:2A-220 New Sec. 28:2A-221 1~ Enrolled Original as avoided or, except in a finance lease that is not a consumer lease, accept the goods with due allowance from the rent payable for the balance of the lease term for the deterioration or the deficiency in quantity but without further right against the lessor PART 3.

Enforceability of lease contract Except as otherwise provided in this article, a lease contract is effective and enforceable according to its terms between the parties, against purchasers of the goods and against creditors of the parties §28:2A-302. Title to and possession of goods Except as otherwise provided in this article, each provision of this article applies whether the lessor or a third party has title to the goods, and whether the lessor, the lessee, or a third party has possession of the goods, notwithstanding any statute or rule of law that possession or the absence of possession is fraudulent §28:2A-303. Alienability of party’s interest under lease contract or of lessor’s residual interest in goods; delegation of performance; transfer of rights a) As used in this section creation of a security interest" includes the sale of a lease contract that is subject to Article 9, Secured Transactions, by reason of §28 9-102 (1 b b) Except as provided in subsections (c) and (d) of this section, a provision in a lease agreement which (i) prohibits the voluntary or involuntary transfer, including a transfer by sale, sublease, creation or enforcement of a security interest, or attachment, levy, or other judicial process, of an interest of a party under the lease contract or of the lessor’s residual interest in the goods, or (ii) makes such a transfer an event of default, gives rise to the right and remedies provided in subsection (e) of this section, but a transfer that is prohibited or is an event of default under the lease agreement is otherwise effective c) A provision in a lease agreement which (i) prohibits the creation or enforcement of a security interest in an interest of a party under the lease contract or in the lessor’s residual interest in the goods, or (ii) makes such a transfer an event or default, is not enforceable unless, and then only to the extent that, there is an actual transfer by the lessee of the lessee’s right of possession or use of the goods in violation of the provision or an actual delegation of a material performance of either party to the lease contract in violation of the provision. Neither the granting nor the enforcement of a security interest in (i) the lessor’s interest under the lease contract, or (ii) the lessor’s residual interest in the goods is a transfer that materially impairs the prospect of obtaining return performance by, materially changes the duty of, or materially increases the burden or risk imposed on, the lessee within the purview of subsection (e) unless, and then only to the extent that, there is an actual delegation of a material performance of the lessor d) A provision in a lease agreement which (i) prohibits a transfer of a right to damages for default with respect to the whole lease contract or of a right to payment arising out of the transferor’s due performance of the transferor’s entire obligation, or (ii) makes such a transfer an event of default, is not enforceable, and such a transfer is not a transfer that materially impairs the prospect of obtaining return performance by, materially changes the duty of, or materially increases the burden or risk New Sec. 28:2A-301 New Sec. 28:2A-302 New Sec. 28:2A-303 15 Enrolled Original imposed on, the other party to the lease contract within the purview of subsection (d) of this section e) Subject to subsections (c) and (d) of this section 1) If a transfer is made which is made an event of default under a lease agreement, the party to the lease contract not making the transfer, unless that party waives the default or otherwise agrees, has the rights and remedies described in §28:2A-501(2 2) If paragraph (1) is not applicable and if a transfer is made that (i) is prohibited under a lease agreement, or (ii) materially impairs the prospect of obtaining return performance by, materially changes the duty of, or materially increases the burden or risk imposed on, the other party to the lease contract, unless the party not making the transfer agrees at any time to the transfer in the lease contract or otherwise, then, except as limited by contract i) the transfer is liable to the party not making the transfer for damages caused by the transfer to the extent that the damages could not reasonably be prevented by the party not making the transfer, and (ii) a court having jurisdication may grant other appropriate relief, including cancellation of the lease contract or an injunction against the transfer f) A transfer of "the lease" or of "all my rights under the lease or a transfer in similar general terms, is a transfer of rights, and, unless the language or the circumstances, as in a transfer for security, indicate the contrary, the transfer is a delegation of duties by the transferor to the transferee. Acceptance by the transferee constitutes a promise by the transferee to perform those duties. The promise is enforceable by either the transferor or the other party to the lease contract g) Unless otherwise agreed by the lessor and the lessee, a delegation of performance does not relieve the transferor as against the other party of any duty to perform or of any liability for default h) In a consumer lease, to prohibit the transfer of an interest of a party under the lease contract or to make a transfer an event of default, the language must be specific, by a writing, and conspicuous §28:2A-304.

A lessee with a voidable leasehold interest has power to transfer a good leasehold interest to a good faith buyer for value or a good faith sublessee for value, but only to the extent set forth in the preceding sentence. When goods have been delivered under a transaction of lease the lessee has that power even though 1) The lessor was deceived as to the identity of the lessee 2) The delivery was in exchange for a check which is later dishonored; or 3) The delivery was procured through fraud punishable as larcenous under the criminal law b) A buyer in the ordinary course of business or a sublessee in the ordinary course of business from a lessee who is a merchant dealing in goods of that kind to whom the goods were entrusted by the lessor obtains, to the extent of the interest transferred, all of the lessor’s and lessee’s rights to the goods, and takes free of the existing lease contract c) A buyer or sublessee from the lessee of goods that are subject to an existing lease contract and are covered by a certificate of title issued under a statute of the District of Columbia or of another jurisdiction takes no greater rights than those provided both by this section and by the certificate of title statute §28:2A-306. t~riority of certain liens arising by operation of law If a person in the ordinary course of his or her business furnishes services or materials with respect to goods subject to a lease contract, a lien upon those goods in the possession of that person given by statute or rule of law for those materials or services takes priority over any interest of the lessor or lessee under the lease contract or this article unless the lien is created by statute and the statute provides otherwise or unless the lien is created by rule of law and the rule of law provides otherwise §28:2A-307. l~riority of liens arising by attachment or levy on, security interests in, and other claims to goods a) Except as otherwise provided in §28:2A-306, a creditor of a lessee takes subject to the lease contract b) Except as otherwise provided in subsections (c) and (d) of this section and in §§28:2A-306 and 28:2A-308, a creditor of a lessor takes subject to the lease contract unless: New Sec. 28:2A-305 New Sec. 28:2A-306 New Sec. 28:2A-308 17 Enrolled Original 1) The creditor holds a lien that attached to the goods before the lease contract became enforceable 2) The creditor holds a security interest in the goods and the lessee did not give value and received delivery of the goods without knowledge of the security interest; or 3) The creditor holds a security interest in the goods which was perfected (§28:9-303) before the lease contract became enforceable c) A lessee in the ordinary course of business takes the leasehold interest free of a security interest in the goods created by the lessor even though the security interest is perfected and the lessee knows of its existence d) A lessee other than a lessee in the ordinary course of business takes the leasehold interest free of a security interest to the extent that it secures future advances made after the secured party acquires knowledge of the lease or more than 45 days after the lease contract becomes enforceable, whichever first occurs, unless the future advances are made pursuant to a commitment entered into without knowledge of the lease and before the expiration of the 45-day period §28:2A-308. Special rights of creditors a) A creditor of a lessor in possession of goods subject to a lease contract may treat the lease contract as void if as against the creditor retention of possession by the lessor is fraudulent under any statute or rule of law, but retention of possession in good faith and current course of trade by the lessor for a commercially reasonable time after the lease contract becomes enforceable is not fraudulent b) Nothing in this article impairs the rights of creditors of a lessor if the lease contract (i) becomes enforceable, not in current course of trade but in satisfaction of or as security for a preexisting claim for money, security, or the like, and (ii) is made under circumstances which under any statute or rule of law apart from this article would constitute the transaction a fraudulent transfer or voidable preference c) A creditor of a seller may treat a sale or an identification of goods to a contract for sale as void if as against the creditor retention of possession by the seller is fraudulent under any statute or rule of law, but retention of possession of the goods pursuant to a lease contract entered into by the seller as lessee and the buyer as lessor in connection with the sale or identification of the goods is not fraudulent if the buyer bought for value and in good faith §28:2A-309.

If the lessee’s right to remove terminates, the priority of the interest of the lessor continues for a reasonable time f) Notwithstanding subsection (d)(1) of this section but otherwise subject to subsections (d) and (e) of this section, the interest of a lessor of fixtures, including the lessor’s residual interest, is subordinate to the conflicting interest of an encumbrancer of the real estate under a construction mortgage recorded before the goods become fixtures if the goods become fixtures before the completion of the construction. To the extent given to refinance a construction mortgage, the conflicting interest of an encumbrancer of the real estate under a mortgage has this priority to the same extent as the encumbrancer of the real estate under the construction mortgage. 19 Enrolled Original g) In cases not within the preceding subsections, priority between the interest of a lessor of fixtures, including the lessor’s residual interest, and the conflicting interest of an encumbrancer or owner of the real estate who is not the lessee is determined by the priority rules governing conflicting interests in real estate h) If the interest of a lessor of fixtures, including the lessor’s residual interest, has priority over all conflicting interests of all owners and encumbrancers of the real estate, the lessor or the lessee may (i) on default, expiration, termination, or cancellation of the lease agreement but subject to the lease agreement and this article, or (ii) if necessary to enforce other rights and remedies of the lessor or lessee under this article, remove the goods from the real estate, free and clear of all conflicting interests of all owners and encumbrancers of the real estate, but the lessor or lessee must reimburse any encumbrancer or owner of the real estate who is not the lessee and who has not otherwise agreed for the cost of repair of any physical injury, but not for any diminution in value of the real estate caused by the absence of the goods removed or by any necessity of replacing them. A person entitled to reimbursement may refuse permission to remove until the party seeking removal gives adequate security for the performance of this obligation i) Even though the lease agreement does not create a security interest, the interest of a lessor of fixtures, including the lessor’s residual interest, is perfected by filing a financing statement as a fixture filing for leased goods that are or are to become fixtures in accordance with the relevant provisions of the Article on Secured Transactions (Article 9 §28:2A-310. Lessor’s and Iessee’s rights when goods become accessions a) Goods are "accessions" when they are installed in or affixed to other goods b) The interest of a lessor or a lessee under a lease contract entered into before the goods became accessions is superior to all interests in the whole except as stated in subsection (d) of this section c) The interest of a lessor or a lessee under a lease contract entered into at the time or after the goods became accessions is superior to all subsequently acquired interests in the whole except as stated in subsection (d) of this section, but is subordinate to interests in the whole existing at the time the lease contract was made unless the holders of such interests in the whole have in writing consented to the lease or disclaimed an interest in the goods as part of the whole d) The interest of a lessor or a lessee under a lease contract described in subsection (b) or (c) of this section is subordinate to the interest of 1) A buyer in the ordinary course of business or a lessee in the ordinary course of business of any interest in the whole acquired after the goods became accessions; or 2) A creditor with a security interest in the whole perfected before the lease contract was made to the extent that the creditor makes subsequent advances without knowledge of the lease contract e) When under subsections (b) or (c) and (d) of this section, a lessor or a lessee of accessions holds an interest that is superior to all interests in the whole, the lessor or the lessee may (i) on default, expiration, termination, or cancellation of the lease contract by the other New Sec. 28:2A-310 20 Enrolled Original party but subject to the provisions of the lease contract and this article, or (ii) if necessary to enforce his or her other rights and remedies under this article, remove the goods from the whole, free and clear of all interests in the whole, but he or she must reimburse any holder of an interest in the whole who is not the lessee and who has not otherwise agreed for the cost of repair of any physical injury but not for any diminution in value of the whole caused by the absence of the goods removed or by any necessity for replacing them. A person entitled to reimbursement may refuse permission to remove until the party seeking removal gives adequate security for the performance of this obligation §28:2A-311. Priority subject to subordination Nothing in this article prevents subordination by agreement by any person entitled to priority PART 4. PERFORMANCE OF LEASE CONTRACT: REPUDIATED, SUBSTITUTED, AND EXCUSED §28:2A-401. Insecurity: adequate assurance of performance a) A lease contract imposes an obligation on each party that the other’s expectation of receiving due performance will not be impaired b) If reasonable grounds for insecurity arise with respect to the performance of either party, the insecure party may demand in writing adequate assurance of due performance. Until the insecure party receives that assurance, if commercially reasonable the insecure party may suspend any performance for which he or she has not already received the agreed return c) A repudiation of the lease contract occurs if assurance of due performance adequate under the circumstances of the particular case is not provided to the insecure party within a reasonable time, not to exceed 30 days after receipt of a demand by the other party d) Between merchants, the reasonableness of grounds for insecurity and the adequacy of any assurance offered must be determined according to commercial standards e) Acceptance of any nonconforming delivery or payment does not prejudice the aggrieved party’s right to demand adequate assurance of future performance §28:2A-402. Anticipatory repudiation If either party repudiates a lease contract with respect to a performance not yet due under the lease contract, the loss of which performance will substantially impair the value of the lease contract to the other, the aggrieved party may 1) For a commercially reasonable time, await retraction of repudiation and performance by the repudiating party 2) Make demand pursuant to §28:2A-401 and await assurance of future performance adequate under the circumstances of the particular case; or 3) Resort to any right or remedy upon default under the lease contract or this article, even though the aggrieved party has notified the repudiating party that the aggrieved party would await the repudiating party’s performance and assurance and has urged retraction.
