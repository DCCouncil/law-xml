BE IT ENACTED BY THE COUNCIL OF THE DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA, That this act may be cited as the “Comprehensive Plan Amendment Act of 2010”. TITLE I. COMPREHENSIVE PLAN Sec. 101. Pursuant to the District of Columbia Comprehensive Plan Act of 1984, effective April 10, 1984 (D.C. Law 5-76; D.C. Official Code § 1-306.01 et seq the Comprehensive Plan for the National Capital: District Elements of 2006, effective March 8, 2007 (10 DCMR A300 through A2520 “Comprehensive Plan” is amended as follows a) Chapter 3 (10 DCMR A300 through A318.11 Land Use Element) is amended as follows 1) Section 302.1 is amended to read as follows: “302.1 The Land Use Goal is: “Ensure the efficient use of land resources to meet long-term neighborhood, citywide, and regional needs; to help foster other District goals; to protect the health, safety, and welfare of District residents, institutions, and businesses; to sustain, restore, or improve the character and stability of neighborhoods in all parts of the city; and to effectively balance the competing demands for land to support the many activities that take place within District boundaries.”. Codification District of Columbia Official Code 2001 Edition 2011 Winter Supp. DCMR RE-ENROLLED ORIGINAL 2Codification District of Columbia Official Code, 2001 Edition (2) Section 304.11 is amended to read as follows: “304.11 Policy LU-1.1.5: Urban Mixed Use Neighborhoods “Encourage new central city mixed-use neighborhoods combining high-density residential, office, retail, cultural, and open space uses in the following areas: “1. Mt. Vernon Triangle; “2. North of Massachusetts Avenue (NoMA “3. Downtown East; “4. South Capitol Street corridor/Stadium area; “5. Near Southeast/Navy Yard; “6. Center Leg Freeway air rights; and “7. Union Station air rights.”. “The location of these areas is shown in the Central Washington and Lower Anacostia Waterfront/Near Southwest Area Elements. Land use regulations and design standards for these areas should ensure that they are developed as attractive pedestrian-oriented neighborhoods, with high-quality architecture and public spaces. Housing, including affordable housing, is particularly encouraged and should be a vital component of the future land-use mix.” 3) A new section 304.13a is added to read as follows: “304.13a Policy LU-1.1.8 Reconnecting the City through Air Rights “Support the development of air rights over rail tracks and highways. In several parts of the central city, there is the potential to build over existing railway tracks and highways. These undeveloped air rights are the result of the interjection of massive transportation infrastructure after the establishment and development of the original city. The tracks and highways have created gaps in the historic urban fabric that have left large areas of the center city divided and difficult to traverse. With substantial investment, these sites represent opportunities for development of housing, retail, and commercial buildings, and for the reconnection of neighborhoods and the street grid. “Where possible, streets should be reconnected and air-rights development should be constructed at and measured from grade level consistent with adjacent land. When development at grade level is not physically possible, air rights should be measured by a means that provides for density and height commensurate with the zone district. Establishment of a measuring point for any particular air-rights development shall be consistent with An Act To regulate the height of buildings in the District of Columbia, approved June 1, 1910 (36 Stat. 452; D.C. Official Code § 6-601.01 et seq “Height Act” and should not be taken as precedent for other development projects in the city. Densities and heights should be sensitive to the surrounding neighborhoods and developments and be sufficient to induce the investment needed for such construction.” 4) A new section 304.16 is added to read as follows: “304.16 Action LU-1.1.C: Development of Air Rights “Analyze the unique characteristics of the air rights development sites within the District. Determine appropriate zoning and means of measuring height for each unique site consistent with the Height Act, taking into consideration the ability to utilize zone densities, the RE-ENROLLED ORIGINAL 3Codification District of Columbia Official Code, 2001 Edition size of the site, and the relationship of the potential development to the existing character of the surrounding areas.” 5) A new section 305.15 is added to read as follows: “305.15 Action LU-1.2.B Encouraging Livability of Former Federal Lands “When land is identified to shift from federal to private or local use, develop planning and zoning approaches that provide for, as appropriate, the reconstruction of historic rights-of- way and reservations, integration of the sites into the adjoining neighborhoods, and the enhancement of special characteristics or opportunities of the sites. Encourage cultural, residential, and retail to ensure mixed-use neighborhoods, even if designated as high-density commercial on the District of Columbia Comprehensive Plan Future Land Use Map; coordinate with the National Capital Planning Commission, as appropriate.” 6) Section 306.6 is amended to read as follows: “306.6 While transit-oriented development is most commonly thought of as a strategy for Metrorail station areas, it is also applicable to premium transit corridors and the city’s “Great Streets.” Seven corridors are designated Great Streets as part of an integrated economic development, transportation, and urban design strategy. The location of these streets is shown in Map 3.5. While not officially designated, four other corridors—Rhode Island Avenue, North/South Capitol Streets, Lower 14th Street, and Bladensburg Road—are also shown on the map to recognize their potential for enhancement.” 7) Section 306.19 is amended to read as follows: “306.19 Action LU-1.3.B: TOD Overlay Zone “During the forthcoming revision to the zoning regulations, develop zoning language in areas surrounding transit stations and stops. The language should include provisions for mixed land uses, minimum and maximum densities (inclusive of density bonuses parking maximums, and buffering and design standards that reflect the presence of transit facilities. Work with land owners, the Council of the District of Columbia, local ANCs, community organizations, WMATA, and the Zoning Commission to determine the stations where such a zone should be applied. The emphasis should be on stations that have the capacity to accommodate substantial increases in ridership and the potential to become pedestrian-oriented urban villages. Neighborhoods that meet these criteria and that would welcome a TOD overlay are the highest priority.” 8) Section 311.8 is amended to read as follows: “311.8 Policy LU-2.3.6: Places of Worship and other Religious Facilities “Recognize places of worship and other religious facilities as an ongoing, important part of the fabric of the city’s neighborhoods. Work proactively with the faith-based community, residents, ANCs, and neighborhood groups to address issues associated with these facilities’ transportation needs, operations, and expansion, so that existing and new religious facilities may be sustained as neighborhood anchors and a source of spiritual guidance for District residents. Recognize also that places of worship or religious assembly, and some other religious facilities or institutions, are accorded important federal constitutional and statutory RE-ENROLLED ORIGINAL 4Codification District of Columbia Official Code, 2001 Edition protections under the First Amendment (U.S. Const. Amend. I) and the Religious Land Use and Institutionalized Persons Act of 2000, approved September 22, 2000 (114 Stat. 803; 42 U.S.C. 2000cc).” 9) A new section 309.18a is added to read as follows: “309.18a Policy LU-2.1.14: Planned Unit Developments in Neighborhood Commercial Corridors “Consider modifying minimum lot size and other filing and procedural (but not height and density) requirements for Planned Unit Developments (PUDs) for neighborhood commercial areas for the purpose of allowing small property owners to participate in projects that encourage high quality developments and provide public benefits.” 10) Section 313.1 is amended to read as follows: “313.1 This section of the Land Use Element addresses five specific activities that require a greater level of direction than can be covered in the “Neighborhood” policies listed and described in the previous sections. These activities are an essential part of the District of Columbia and are vital to the city’s future. Each of these uses presents a unique set of challenges and land use compatibility issues. They include: “(a) Public Works and Industrial Uses, which are essential to government operations and the local economy, but also create external impacts and face displacement for higher value land uses; “(b) Institutional Uses, including places of worship and other religious facilities, that seek vacant land or developed properties for expansion, but where expansion is limited because the properties are hemmed in by adjacent neighborhoods; “(c) Foreign Missions, namely the chanceries and embassies of foreign governments, which seek to locate or expand in some of the city’s most desirable neighborhoods; “(d) Group Homes, Community Based Residential Facilities, and Supportive Housing, which provide for the essential housing and socialization needs of thousands of District residents but may end up concentrated in particular parts of the city; and “(e) Federal Facilities, which often operate in immediate proximity to residential neighborhoods, creating the need for sensitive planning as these uses expand, contract, and implement new security measures.” 11) Section 315.1 is amended to read as follows: “315.1 Institutional uses occupy almost 2,300 acres—an area larger than all of the city’s retail, office, and hotel uses combined. These uses include colleges and universities, private schools, child care facilities, places of worship and other religious facilities, hospitals, private and nonprofit organizations, and similar entities.” b) Chapter 4 (10 DCMR A400 through A420 Transportation Element) is amended as follows 1) Section 403.8 is amended to read as follows: “403.8 Policy T-1.1.2: Land Use Impact Assessment “Assess the transportation impacts of development projects using multi-modal standards RE-ENROLLED ORIGINAL 5Codification District of Columbia Official Code, 2001 Edition rather than traditional vehicle standards to more accurately measure and more effectively mitigate development impacts on the transportation network.

Transit shelters, waiting platforms, signage, off-board fare collection, on-street bicycle facilities, pedestrian connections, and other improvements should contribute to citywide urban design goals.” 4) Section 915.6 is amended to read as follows: “915.6 Policy UD-3.3.4: Metro Station Entrances “Promote design improvements and public art at transit station entrances and transit stops, providing a stronger sense of arrival and orientation for travelers.” h) Chapter 11 (10 DCMR A1100 through A1114) is amended by adding a new section 1106.21 to read as follows: “1106.21 Action CSF-2.1.B: Review Zoning Issues Review and assess zoning regulations to identify barriers to, and create opportunities for, the development of primary care facilities and neighborhood clinics, including the reuse of existing non-residential buildings in residential zones, after a public review and approval process that provides an opportunity to address neighborhood impacts.” i) Chapter 12 (10 DCMR A1200 through A1214 Education Facilities Element) is amended as follows 1) Section 1200.2 is amended to read as follows: “1200.2 The crucial educational facilities issues facing the District of Columbia are RE-ENROLLED ORIGINAL 13Codification District of Columbia Official Code, 2001 Edition addressed in this Element. These include: “(a) Modernizing the District’s public schools to provide a safe and stimulating learning environment for District students; “(b) Re-establishing quality schools that are anchors and assets for District neighborhoods; and “(c) Encouraging university and community college satellite campuses east of the Anacostia River to provide expanded educational opportunities.” 2) Section 1200.5 is amended to read as follows: “1200.5 Because the emphasis of the Comprehensive Plan is on the physical environment, this Element, as it relates to DCPS, addresses school land and buildings, rather than educational curriculum, teacher quality, school administration and other programmatic issues. Those issues are critically important, but they are addressed by the DCPS Master Education Plan and other DCPS documents. Policies in the Educational Facilities Element are intended to work in tandem with those adopted by DCPS, the Office of the Deputy Mayor for Education, and the Office of Public Education Facilities Modernization as a coordinated, internally consistent strategy for educational excellence and neighborhood revitalization.” 3) Section 1202.1 is amended to read as follows: “1202.1 Public education in the District of Columbia is provided by the District of Columbia Public Schools (DCPS) and by public charter schools. DCPS is a traditional local education agency. It is responsible for educating District of Columbia children and coordinates with the Office of Public Education Facilities Modernization (OPEFM) in planning, operating, maintaining, designing, and constructing public school facilities (see text box on 12-4 The Public Charter schools are publicly funded schools organized as nonprofit corporations and managed by independent Boards of Trustees.” 4) Section 1202.4 is amended to read as follows: “1202.4 Understanding the Relationship of DC Public Schools to District Government “The District of Columbia Public Education Reform Amendment Act of 2007, effective June 12, 2007 (D.C. Law 17-9; 54 DCR 4102 created a new and re-organized structure of educational leadership. Direct mayoral control of District of Columbia Public Schools (DCPS) as a cabinet-level agency was established. The Mayor appoints a Deputy Mayor for Education to support the development and implementation of an education reform vision. In addition, the Mayor appoints a Chancellor to oversee day-to-day operations of DCPS, including academic improvement and student performance, and the hiring of teachers and principals. The Office of State Superintendent of Education (OSSE) requests, distributes, and monitors the use of federal grant monies, sets state policy and regulations, and supports and advises the District’s State Board of Education. The District’s State Board of Education is responsible for advising OSSE on educational matters, including state standards and state policies, including those governing special, academic, vocational, charter, and other schools, state objectives, and state regulations proposed by the Mayor or the State Superintendent of Education. The Office of Public Education Facilities Modernization (OPEFM) oversees the maintenance, construction, and RE-ENROLLED ORIGINAL 14Codification District of Columbia Official Code, 2001 Edition modernization of all DCPS facilities. All public charter schools receive authority from the Public Charter School Board.” 5) Section 1203.4 is amended to read as follows: “1203.4 Between 1998 and 2006, significant progress toward the modernization of the building stock was made. Five elementary schools (Oyster, Barnard, Miner, Key, and Randle Highlands) were fully modernized. McKinley Technology High School is in its second year of operation, and Kelly Miller is now operating as a state-of-the-art middle school on the site of a formerly closed facility. The combined Bell and Lincoln Schools in Columbia Heights, and Thomson Elementary School in Shaw will soon join the inventory of modernized facilities.” 6) Section 1203.6 is amended to read as follows: “1203.6 Strongly support efforts to prepare long-range master facility plans so that the school modernization program is based on comprehensive system-wide assessments of facility condition, enrollment trends, long-term needs, and the District’s land use plans.” 7) Section 1204 is amended to read as follows: “1204 The appeal of these schools stems from several sources: they are free, their curriculum is set by an independent board of trustees, and they often specialize in particular subject areas such as math, science, or performing arts. The public charter schools are funded by a per pupil allowance that helps them acquire and renovate space. They are approved and monitored by the District of Columbia Public Charter School Board.” 8) Section 1204.5 is amended to read as follows: “1204.5 The former Board of Education also adopted general principles acknowledging the role of charter schools in meeting the diverse needs of the city’s population and emphasizing the importance of safe and secure neighborhood public school facilities, regardless of who operates them. These principles laid the groundwork for co-location standards and detailed procedures for accommodating public charter schools within DCPS buildings. For instance, the standards allow charters to lease floors in underutilized school buildings where certain conditions are met (such as a separate entrance and adequate visitor parking While co- location may accommodate some of the demand for space, it is likely that space may be needed in non-school buildings as well.” 9) Section 1204.7 is amended to read as follows: “1204.7 Support efforts to co-locate Charter Schools within DCPS facilities. Ensure that parking, traffic, noise, and other impacts associated with increased enrollment and space utilization are addressed when co-location occurs.” 10) Section 1206.3 is amended to read as follows: “1206.3 Encourage DCPS and OPEFM to plan for the modernization of entire school campuses rather than just the school buildings. Where school facilities are adjoined by athletic fields, playgrounds, and open space, the improvement of these areas should be included in renovation plans wherever feasible. In addition, school employee parking should not be provided at the expense of recreational space. ” 11) Section 1207.4 is amended to read as follows: “1207.4 Policy EDU-1.5.5: Adaptive Re-Use RE-ENROLLED ORIGINAL 15Codification District of Columbia Official Code, 2001 Edition “In the event that DCPS facilities are surplused, provide a right of first refusal to public charter schools for use of the facilities, and, thereafter, if converted to non-school uses, require the new uses to be sensitive to neighborhood context and to mitigate impacts on parking, traffic, noise, and other quality-of-life factors. Provide for public review of potential new uses and ensure that any issues related to prior jurisdiction over the site by the federal government are addressed.” 12) Section 1207.11 is amended to read as follows: “1207.11 Consistent with the DC Municipal Regulations, use the following priorities to determine the future use of schools that are deemed surplus and turned over to the Department of Real Estate Services: “(a) First priority should be re-use for direct educational purposes, including Public Charter schools. “(b) Second priority should be for other District agency facilities that strengthen families, such as day care and early childhood development centers, job training libraries, recreation centers, or health care. “(c) Third priority should be for other uses that provide a public benefit (such as District government administrative offices or affordable housing).” 13) Section 1211.4 is amended to read as follows: “1211.4 The University of the District of Columbia is the District’s only postsecondary public educational institution. The historically black university is also the only urban land-grant institution in the nation. In 2009, the university established the Community College of the District of Columbia as a component institution, and now offers certificate, associate, baccalaureate, and graduate level degrees that are tailored to meet the unique needs of the District. Available programs range from associate degrees in Nursing and Mortuary Science to masters degrees in Cancer Biology Prevention and Clinical Psychology. Over 50 different programs of study are offered.” 14) Section 1211.6 is amended to read as follows: “1211.6 UDC and the Community College of the District of Columbia (CCDC) serve a very diverse population that includes students from over 25 different nations. The CCDC has an open admissions policy that is particularly beneficial for non-traditional students. Together, these institutions provide an important opportunity for young adults and adult learners to gain a quality education at an affordable price.” 15) Section 1212.1 is amended to read as follows: “1212.1 Continued political and financial support for UDC and CCDC is essential if they are to fulfill their mission as a viable educational option and path to career advancement for District residents. Expansion of satellite campuses to better serve residents’ educational and training needs is an idea that has much support throughout the community. Neighborhoods east of the Anacostia River are particularly well situated for such expansion. There is only one CCDC campus there with limited program offerings and there are several large sites where additional campuses might be accommodated. This element recommends that additional satellite campuses be established.”. RE-ENROLLED ORIGINAL 16Codification District of Columbia Official Code, 2001 Edition (16) Section 1212.2 is amended to read as follows: “1212.2 Sustain, promote, and advance the University of the District of Columbia and the Community College of the District of Columbia as the city’s only public institutions of higher learning and continuing education for District residents.” 17) Section 1212.3 is amended to read as follows: “1212.3 Strengthen the Community College of the District of Columbia to continue training students for the baccalaureate program at UDC, and to build practical career skills that prepare students for current and future employment in the District.” 18) Section 1212.4 is amended to read as follows: “1212.4 Pursue the development and expansion of satellite campuses of the University of the District of Columbia and the Community College of the District of Columbia east of the Anacostia River.” 19) Section 1213.3 is amended to read as follows: “1213.3 Encourage partnerships between the city’s colleges and universities, anchor institutions, and K-12 schools to create additional pathways to learning for District students and young adults.” j) Chapter 15 (10 DCMR A1500 through A1514 Capitol Hill Area Element) is amended as follows 1) Section 1510.4, which is Map 15.1 and depicts Capitol Hill Policy Focus Areas, is amended by changing the color in the legend for the H Street/Benning Road area from pink to light blue 2) Section 1511.12 is amended to read as follows: “1511.12 Policy CH-2.1.7: H Street Overpass “Ensure that any future development in the air rights adjacent to the H Street overpass recognizes the limitations of the streets beneath the bridge to serve high volume commercial traffic and includes provisions for parking and delivery ingress and egress from the bridge itself. The allowable height of any building constructed in the air rights should be measured consistent with the Height Act and relate positively to the surroundings with special attention to Union Station and other historic buildings, the federal precincts on Capitol Hill, and existing neighborhoods to the east and west. Development must give special attention to the preservation and enhancement of and views to Union Station and its historic surroundings by ensuring the provision of exemplary architecture and encouraging upper story setbacks and minimized penthouses.” 3) A new section 1512.10a is added to read as follows: “1512.10a Policy CH-2.2.7: Hine Junior High School Site “Promote continued investment and redevelopment of Hine Junior High School, an important community public facility, which was closed in the summer of 2008. Redevelopment of the site should complement the adjacent neighborhood.” k) Chapter 16 (10 DCMR A1600 through A1618 Central Washington Area Element) is amended as follows 1) Section 1607.2(h) is amended to read as follows: RE-ENROLLED ORIGINAL 17Codification District of Columbia Official Code, 2001 Edition “(h) The “federal” city and “domestic” city should be connected as one, as they are in other great national capital cities. The Mall’s museums and attractions are ringed by imposing federal office buildings that offer few amenities or opportunities for visitors, or even their own employees, and little indication of what lies a few blocks beyond. The expansion of development and redevelopment around the Mall should begin to diminish these distinctions and provide more amenities closer to the Mall. There will need to be special efforts to draw tourists into Downtown, such as signage and streetscape improvements, new transportation modes, such as the DC Circulator, and the development of new attractions, such as the Newseum and Spy Museum in the heart of Downtown. In addition to the urban design benefits of unifying the Mall and Downtown, there are other benefits as more visitors choose to dine, shop, and stay in the District. Waterfront park improvements provide another way to tie the city together; developing a continuous 11-mile band of waterfront open space from Georgetown to the Arboretum was an important theme of the NCPC Legacy Plan and will continue to be a priority in the future.” 2) Section 1608.5 is amended to read as follows: “1608.5 Policy CW-1.1.5: New Housing Development in Central Washington “Encourage the development of new high-density housing in Central Washington, particularly in the area north of Massachusetts Avenue, east of Mount Vernon Square, and the L’Enfant Plaza/Near Southwest. This area includes Mount Vernon Triangle, Northwest One, NoMA, and the L’Enfant Plaza/Near Southwest. Ground floor retail space and similar uses should be strongly encouraged within these areas to create street-life and provide neighborhood services for residents. A strong Downtown residential community can create pedestrian traffic, meet local-housing needs, support local businesses in the evenings and on weekends, and increase neighborhood safety and security.” 3) Section 1612.7 is amended to read as follows: “1612.7 Policy CW-2.2.2: East End Theater District “Promote the area bounded by 6th Street, 14th Street, F Street, and Pennsylvania Avenue as an internationally recognized theater district, capitalizing on the presence of long-existing theaters, such as the National, Warner, Ford’s, Woolly Mammoth, and the Shakespeare’s Lansburgh Theater and new theaters such as the Sidney Harman Center and the Washington Stage Guild. Marketing, promotion, signage, and special programs should be used to “brand” the area as the region’s top performing arts center. Complementary evening uses such as restaurants should be encouraged in this area.” 4) Section 1617.5 is amended to read as follows: “1617.5 Policy CW-2.7.1: Enhancing the Near Southwest “Work collaboratively with the National Capital Planning Commission to improve the aesthetic quality, identity, and pedestrian character of the Near Southwest. Plans for the area should identify streetscape and signage improvements, pedestrian circulation changes, measures to mitigate the scale of the area’s monolithic buildings, guidelines for new (or replacement) buildings within the area, and the potential for new residential uses if federal properties transfer from federal use.”. RE-ENROLLED ORIGINAL 18Codification District of Columbia Official Code, 2001 Edition (5) A new section 1617.7a is added to read as follows: “1617.7a Policy CW-2.7.4: Redevelopment of Maryland Avenue SW and Surrounding Lands “Require residential uses and neighborhood livability standards for the creation of a new mixed-use neighborhood as part of any redevelopment of the Maryland Avenue SW area; provide for the reconstruction of Maryland Avenue SW, including cultural use and public space as appropriate.” 6) A new section 1617.9 is added to read as follows: “1617.9 Action CW-2.7.B: Residential Uses in the Near Southwest “Use innovative zoning, as appropriate, to link development potential to identified infrastructure improvements, and coordinate with the National Capital Planning Commission to identify infrastructure consistent with local and federal planning goals for the area. Innovative zoning may include establishing a direct correlation between maximum zoning entitlements and infrastructure construction and requiring minimum residential densities.” 7) Section 1618.10 is amended to read as follows: “1618.10 Policy CW-2.8.2: East of the Tracks and Eckington Place Transition Areas “Create a production/arts and live/work, mixed-use area east of the CSX railroad tracks between H Street NE and Florida Avenue NE and in the area east of Eckington Place and north of New York Avenue. Some of this area is shown as “Mixed Use Production Distribution Repair/Residential” areas on the Future Land Use Map. The intent of this designation is not to blend industrial uses with housing but rather to retain viable industrial activities until market conditions support their conversion to live/work space, housing, artists’ studios, and similar uses. Mixed use squares in the NoMA area have unique characteristics that allow for a balance of industrial, residential, and office uses. The industrial striping on the Future Land Use Map anticipates some office use. These two areas should generally not be developed as large-scale commercial office building areas. Mixed-use development, including housing, should be encouraged in both locations.” 8) A new section 1618.18 is added to read as follows: “1618.18 Action CW-2.8.E: Public Participation in Union Station Air Rights Development “Because of the Union Station air rights’ uniquely diverse surroundings – including rowhouses, historic landmarks, and dense office development – and its potential to spur other investment in the neighborhood, implement a process that requires public participation in the review of any development application for that site.”. “(l) Chapter 17 (10 DCMR A1700 through A1718 Far Northeast &amp;amp; Southeast Area Element) is amended as follows 1) Section 1709.3 is amended to read as follows 1709.3 Policy FNS-1.2.3: Fort Dupont Park “Improve access to Fort Dupont Park by providing shared parking, bicycle and pedestrian access, and public transit service.

The "Great Streets" corridor along Martin Luther King, Jr Avenue from the Anacostia River on the north to just past Malcolm X Avenue on the south, including the St. Elizabeths Hospital site, should be developed with medium to high density mixed uses, offering supportive retail services to office workers and residents alike and providing housing opportunities to people who want to live and work in the area. Strongly promote mixed use development, including retail, service and residential uses as well as office uses, on the portions of the St. Elizabeths Hospital site along Martin Luther King, Jr Avenue. Such mixed use development should face the street and be open to the public, outside security barriers that may otherwise be required. Additional opportunities for future housing development and employment growth in the Far Southeast/Southwest should be directed to the area around the Congress Heights Metro Stations and along the Great Streets corridors of South Capitol Street. Provide improved transit and automobile access to these areas and improve their visual and urban design qualities. Any increase in zoning or density around the Metro station shall only be available through a planned unit development with the expectation that commensurate benefits shall accrue to the neighborhood in terms of education and job opportunities, new and affordable housing for homeownership, improved urban design, and public infrastructure improvements. The planned unit development shall provide civic and cultural amenities, promote quality in design of buildings and public spaces, support local schools, create opportunities for cultural events and public art, and enhance the public realm by addressing safety and cleanliness issues 2) Section 1808.7 is amended to read as follows: “1808.7 Policy FSS-1.1.6: Anacostia Streetcar Project “Coordinate land use and transportation decisions along the proposed route of the Anacostia Streetcar. Future development along the streetcar line should be clustered around proposed transit stops. In addition, the streetcar route should be designed and planned to minimize impacts on traffic flow and to avoid negative impacts on the historic character of the Anacostia community.” 3) A new section 1808.22 is added to read as follows: “1808.22 Policy FSS-1.1.14: District government Incentives for Economic RE-ENROLLED ORIGINAL 20Codification District of Columbia Official Code, 2001 Edition Development “Use the full range of incentives and tools available to the District Government, including tax abatements, tax increment financing, PILOTs, eminent domain, and planned unit developments to promote and leverage economic development in the Far Southeast/Southwest area.” 4) Section 1811.5 is amended to read as follows: “1811.5 Policy FSS-2.1.2: Activity Concentrations “Concentrate development activity in Historic Anacostia at the following locations: “(a) The Metro station, including the station site and the adjacent Bethlehem Baptist Church site, which should be developed with a mix of single and multi-family homes with ground floor retail.

Within the Lower Anacostia Waterfront/ Near Southwest Planning Area, new neighborhoods should be developed at the Southwest Waterfront, Buzzard Point, Poplar Point, Southeast Federal Center and Carrollsburg areas. These neighborhoods should be linked to new neighborhoods upriver at Reservation 13, and Kenilworth-Parkside. A substantial amount of new housing and commercial space should be developed in these areas, reaching households of all incomes, types, sizes, and needs.” 2) Section 1911.4 is amended to read as follows: “1911.4 While the Southwest Waterfront Plan provides important guidance, the specific development square footage and housing-unit targets should be interpreted as illustrative, as they were developed in 2003 under different market conditions. Final development plans for the Southwest Waterfront should respond to guidance of the Southwest Waterfront Plan, as well as new policies in the Comprehensive Plan that support sustainable and compact development that enhances access to transit. Illustrative sketches in the Southwest Waterfront Plan envision new residences, hotels, retail, office, cultural, and civic uses. New public gathering places will include an urban “Market Square” near the Fish Wharf, and a more passive Civic Park at the south end of the waterfront near M Street SW. Between these spaces will be a series of smaller plazas on the Washington Channel that mark the ends of local streets. The existing fish market will be retained in its present location and refurbished, with its low-scale character maintained. Development of the park at the south end of the waterfront is contingent on a number of factors, including relocation of the tour-boat terminals and surface parking to a new location further north on the Channel. Until this can be accomplished, the existing terminals will be supported in their current location. Even though the Future Land Use Map designates the location of the tour-boat terminals and their surface parking as Mixed Use Low Density Commercial and Parks, Recreation, and Open Space, the existing low density commercial use and zoning would not be inconsistent with this map designation.” 3) Section 1911.7 is amended to read as follows: “1911.7 Policy AW-2.1.1: Mixed Use Development “Support the redevelopment of the Southwest Waterfront with medium to high-density RE-ENROLLED ORIGINAL 23Codification District of Columbia Official Code, 2001 Edition housing, commercial and cultural uses, and improved open space and parking. The Future Land Use Map shows high density development and it is expected that the project will capitalize on height opportunities to provide public spaces and, where appropriate, a mix of medium development density in order to transition to the surrounding neighborhoods. The development should also be designed to make the most of the waterfront location, preserving views and enhancing access to and along the shoreline.” 4) Section 1914.9 is amended to read as follows: “1914.9 Policy AW-2.4.3: Poplar Point Mixed Use Neighborhood “Create a new transit-oriented mixed use neighborhood oriented around the Poplar Point Park, linked to the Anacostia Metrorail station and new Anacostia streetcar line. The neighborhood should include a significant component of affordable housing and should also include retail and civic uses that benefit the adjacent communities east of I-295. Within the overall mix of uses, allow segments of the future development to be devoted entirely to office use to encourage location of Federal office space and other office space supportive of Federal government agencies to occupy new buildings at Poplar Point. This should be particularly targeted to office space related to the Department of Homeland Security consolidation at the St. Elizabeths site. To minimize the loss of useable open space, development should utilize the land recovered after the realignment and reconstruction of the Frederick Douglass Bridge 5) Section 1914.11 is amended to read as follows: “1914.11 Policy AW-2.4.5: Scale of Development at Poplar Point “Provide a scale and pattern of development in Poplar Point that recognizes the area’s proximity to a Metrorail station and other major surface arterials and that the area is physically separated from surrounding neighborhoods and, therefore, may accommodate buildings and site plans unlike but compatible with the fine-grained pattern found in nearby Historic Anacostia. Development should be pedestrian-oriented and should include active ground floor uses. The massing, height, and bulk of buildings and related features such as parking also should respect adjacent park uses and environmentally sensitive areas 6) Section 1914.15 is amended to read as follows: “1914.15 Action AW-2.4.A: Poplar Point Planning “(a) Conduct additional detailed planning studies for Poplar Point, refining the preliminary development program set forth by the 2003 Target Area Plan. The desired mix of land uses and building intensities for the site should be further defined, and the specific transportation and infrastructure improvements necessary to support development and park construction should be identified.
