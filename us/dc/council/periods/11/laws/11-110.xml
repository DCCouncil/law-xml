This includes travel to jobs, shopping areas, recreation, and social activities b) Transportation systems, historically, have been a major factor in determining city development and land use patterns. Efficient transportation planning can minimize the need for trips, especially automobile trips by persons going to and from work, that negatively affect the local environment. A major consideration in selecting a location for a particular activity is its accessibility to transportation, which is a major land use in its own right c) The ward transportation network generally provides for the efficient movement of vehicles, goods, and services. Traffic on major streets is usually heavy, particularly during morning and evening peak rush hours. Pennsylvania Avenue, Benning and Naylor Roads, and East Capitol Street are the major east-west arterials. Kenilworth, Minnesota, and Alabama ENROLLED ORIGINAL Avenues are the primary north-south arterials, all encompassing high traffic volumes d) Private automobiles, buses, and Metrorail are the primary means of transportation within this ward. Neighborhood bus service is usually found on major arterials as opposed to secondary streets e) There are three Metrorail stations within the ward, Deanwood, Minnesota Avenue, and the Benning Road stations, that accommodate ward residents. Although it is located in Maryland, the Capitol Heights station is adjacent to the District line and is convenient for many Ward 7 residents. These stations also serve as major transfer points to buses f) Bicycling, a leisure and recreational activity for some, is also becoming an important mode of transit. The D.C. Bicycle Advisory Council (BAC) and the Department of Public Works (DPW) have made progress in updating a Transportation Bicycle Plan. The effort promotes bicycling as another link in the overall transportation system. The bikeway network in Ward 7 includes off street trails along a segment of Anacostia Park between East Capitol Street and Benning Road, a segment along the Watts Branch Creek Park and through Fort Circle Parks as well as three on street routes along East Capitol Street, Massachusetts Avenue, and Pennsylvania Avenue. The on street bikeways end at the Anacostia River bridges g) Additional transportation services, such as the Call-N-Ride Taxi Service for the elderly, Washington Elderly and Handicapped Transportation Service, and publicly supported taxi service are commuter services available to the ward’s elderly and disabled residents b) Section 3(b)(1) is amended in the lead-in language by striking the phrase "Section 4(b)(5 D.C.
