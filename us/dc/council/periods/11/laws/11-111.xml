Code, sec. 1- 1130(b)(1 is amended by inserting except contracts not for the privatization of day-to-day operations of the Blue Plains Wastewater Treatment Plant entered into by the District of Columbia Water and Sewer Authority established pursuant to the Water and Sewer Authority Establishment and Department of Public Works Reorganization Act of 1995 after "12-month period Title V Fiscal Impact Statement. Sec. 501 a) The fiscal impact of this legislation on the operating and capital budgets for the current and next 5 years will be to pay for the cost for District agencies water and sewer services and/’or reallocating central service costs currently being paid to the District to allow for funding new functions in the areas of financial planning, accounting, personnel, procurement, treasury and legal. The most recent Central Services Recovery Plan shows these costs to be approximately $8 million annually. Current District policy requires that central service costs not be recognized in favor of not billing municipal owned and leased agencies for water and sewer services estimated at $10.9 annually. This means, that to date, the District would not charge WASUA for central service costs and WASUA would not charge District agencies for water and sewer services. It is expected that the new Authority will charge the District for water and sewer services. In return, any central service costs contracted by the Authority from the District will be paid by the Authority. Therefore, the first year’s estimated net cost to the District for water and sewer services will be $2.9 million, which the Executive will have to budget for in the budgets of District agencies. This cost will increase in the next 5 years due to the need for increases in water and sewer service rates. The Committee notes now that District agencies will be charged for water and sewer services, they will be expected to conserve water, decreasing the cost to the District for these services b) Similarly, annual District intra-district costs for services provided by other District agencies for fleet maintenance, energy costs and management, communication costs and management, printing, legal services, and contractual oversight and disbursements are approximately $20 million, this includes about 6 million for a ten percent overhead rate charge -22 ENROLLED ORIGINAL by DPW for handling maintenance contracts. The new Authority is expected to manage or seek these services on a competitive basis in the future. Therefore, to the extent that the District does not provide this service, there will be no cost to the District c) Likewise, the Utility is charged a ten percent indirect cost rate on capital expenditures by the District’s Office of the Budget. The annual cost is around $1 million. The new Authority is expected to handle all capital financing and debt service functions in the future. Therefore, to the extent that the District does not provide this service, there will be no cost to the District d) Other costs may include compensation for District Board members not otherwise compensated by the District or other public or private entity and a staff for an estimated annual cost of up to $1 million. The Committee notes that these costs are to be incurred by the Authority, and not the District government e) The legislation will require legal services and other outside consultant costs to establish the organizational structure that will accommodate the new responsibilities to be assumed by the new Authority in the areas of financial planning, accounting, personnel and procurement. It is estimated that the costs may range from a low of 5 million to a high of $1 million. Existing water and sewer revenues will be used to fund this and other Authority set-up cost f) With regard to the $81.3 million in WASUA reserves that was used to meet other expenditures by the Executive in Fiscal Year 1995, the Executive has noted to the Committee that $7.4 million of the reserves was used for WASUA expenditures in Fiscal Year 1995. The Executive has indicated to the Committee that as part of its development of a 5 year financial plan, it is developing a timetable for making the remainder of these reserve funds available to the Authority. Therefore, the Executive will have to transfer reserve funds to the Authority over the next 5 years g) Pending the intra-District transfer authorized by section 207(e all assets and liabilities of WASUA, as indicated on the balance sheet prepared by WASUA just prior to the effective date of this act, shall be transferred for the Authority’s use on an interim basis. What is the fiscal impact of Section 215 of the bill, Merit Personnel system Inapplicable? Section 215 of the bill transfers to all employees of the new Authority, fights under Title V (access to Public Employees Relations Board) and Title XVI[ (Labor/Management Relations and transfers to employees covered under the Civil Service Retirement System or D.C. Defined Contribution Pension Plan, rights under Title XII (Hours of Work, Legal Holidays, Leave Title XXI (Health Benefits Title XXII (Life Insurance) and Title XXVI (Retirement This section also provides that employees continuously employed since December 31, 1979 shall receive fights and benefits at least equal to those currently applicable. In FY 1995, the cost of these benefits was approximately $6.75 million. Under the proposed legislation, these benefits would continue at the same level 23 ENROLLED ORIGINAL however, the cost would shift from the General fund to the Water and Sewer Enterprise Fund. What are the potential costs of contracting out/displaced workers under Section 203(10 Section 203(10 as amended, provides that the Authority may contract out operations under certain circumstances, provided that if the contact displaces any District employees, the contractor must offer the displaced employee a right of first refusal to employment. The section also requires the contractor to adopt the terms of the collective bargaining agreement with respect to wages and benefits. The fiscal impact of this provision of the bill is difficult to determine at this point. The fiscal impact will be determined to the extent that a bidder passes along any supplemental costs associated with the above provisions on to the Authority. o The fiscal impact statement does not address how assets and liabilities will be handled by the proposed Authority and the District. Additionally, the use of assets by the Authority, while the District retains ownership of the assets, raises some concerns regarding the independence of the Authority. For example, how will depreciation of facilities be used by the Authority? The fiscal impact (and operational impact) or the assignment of the use of assets cannot be calculated in advance of the independent audit to be performed under Section 207(e) of the bill. This bill is intended to be enabling legislation, designed to reorganize the Department of Public Works to create an independent District agency (D.C. Water and Sewer Authority Many of the specific details of how the new Authority would operate, and its relationship with the District government, were purposefully left to be determined during the drafting of regulations for the Authority. This bill is carefully balanced to attempt to meet several urgent needs: Provide for the efficient distribution of water in the District, and treatment of wastewater from the District and suburban user jurisdictions. Establish a new District agency with funding completely separate from the General Fund and with independent personnel and procurement systems. Ensure that the District government’s interest in land and facilities were maintained and that the District government maintained some level of general policy control over the new agency 24- ENROLLED ORIGINAL In balancing these needs, and to simplify the reorganization of a portion of the Department of Public Works into this new Authority, the Executive determined that title to the land and facilities would remain with the District government. As is provided in most agency reorganizations, the District government would assign the use of these facilities to the new agency (Authority In addition, a thorough examination of the current assets and operations of the existing Water and Sewer Utility Administration would be conducted to assist in determining which assets are required for the Authority’s use and which WASUA facilities are to be properly assignable to the new Authority. Does the $10.9 million estimate for the cost of water and sewer services to District agencies include independent agencies? Yes. The Committee Report mentions that $7.4 million of the original $81.3 million borrowed from the Enterprise Fund was used ~br Water and Sewer Utility Administration expenditures in FY 1995. What were these expenditures? Each year, if Water and Sewer Utility Administration expenditures exceed revenues received, funds are transferred from the reserve fund to pay for these operating expenditures. In FY 1995 7.4 million was transferred from reserves to pay operating expenses of WASUA. Sec. 601. section 204. Title VI Applicability.
