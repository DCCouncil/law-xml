Section 40-621 DCMR ENROLLED ORIGINAL Sec. 6. The Council of the District of Columbia finds that the fiscal impact of this act will be as follows: The Metropolitan Police Department MPD has forwarded a fiscal impact statement indicating that the MPD will perform the new requirements of the law as part of their on-going functions and with no new resources needed. The Department of Corrections Department has forwarded a fiscal impact statement estimating that the provisions in section 3, which increase the fines and penalties for prostitution, will cost $9 million over a 6-year period. Section 3 sets the penalty for the first offense of prostitution at no less than 1 day imprisonment and no more than 90 days. Current law imposes only a $300 fine for the first offense. The Department’s analysis is based on the assumption that all persons confined for prostitution will be confined for 90 days. Currently, the Department estimates that there are 29 persons incarcerated each month and assumes that all of these persons will be incarcerated under the new law, for a full 90 days. Based on this assumption, the change in law would increase yearly costs by $1,760,810. However, the Department is assuming a worst-case scenario and a more realistic assumption is that only a handful of persons convicted of prostitution would receive 90 days in jail under the new law. Sec. 7. This act shall take effect following approval by the Mayor (or in the event of veto by the Mayor, action by the Council to override the veto approval by the Financial Responsibility and Management Assistance Authority as provided in section 203(a) of the District of Columbia Financial Responsibility and Management Assistance Authority Act of 1995, approved April 17, 1995 (109 Stat. 116; D.C.

IV. V. VI. VII. Vffl. IX. BACKGROUND AND NEED PURPOSE AND EFFECT LEGISLATIVE HISTORY SECTION BY SECTION ANALYSIS SUMMARY OF PUBLIC HEARINGS FISCAL IMPACT STATEMENT IMPACT ON EXISTING LAW COMMI’Iq’EE ACTION ATI’ACHMENTS I. BACKGROUND AND NEED Prostitution is a serious problem in the District of Columbia. Certain areas of downtown Washington, particularly the eastern portion of downtown (near 12 and K Streets, N.W Logan Circle and Blagden Alley, are suffering terribly from the effects of the prostitution trade. The presence of prostitutes increases noise, litter, and crime in the neighborhood. Residents, both old and young, are constantly confronted with the evidence of prostitution activity and tourists are driven away from seeking accommodations in affected areas. The Metropolitan Police Department MPD reported that in fiscal year 1995, the MPD made a total of 2,438 arrests for prostitution-related offenses. Of these, only 892 arrest were made under the prostitution laws. The remainder, 1,546, were made were made for Failure to Obey FTO FrO is a criminal charge brought against a driver or a pedestrian who fails to obey the lawful order of a police officer in a traffic situation. This fine is currently set at a maximum of $50 xdthough FrO is a statute of general applicability, it is often used in prostitution cases because proving the crime of prostitution requires extensive police resources, including the use of undercover police officers. However, these FrO arrests have not made a dent in the prostitution market. Prostitutes simply forfeit collateral as a cost of doing business and are back on the streets within a few hours. Bill 11-439, as originally introduced, contained the following provisions: o It authorized the Metropolitan Police Department to release to the public the name, address, date of birth, occupation, and photograph of any person an’ested under the prostitution statute, in exchange for a reasonable fee. o It increased the criminal penalties for those who are found guilty of prostitution. o It permitted courts to require defendants to stay away from the area within which a prostitution offense occurred, as a condition of probation. o It amended the current civil forfeiture law to create a lien in favor of the District of Columbia in an amount equal to the cost of towing, storing, and processing vehicles seized and subject to civil forfeiture. o It amended the detention statute, D.C. Code § 23-1321, by specifying that a judge may order a defendant to stay away from the area within which the offense allegedly occurred, as a condition of pre-trial release. o It repealed section 23-1321(c)(3) of the D.C. Code to allow bond to be used as a means of pre-trial detention in all criminal cases. o It increased the fine for FTO from a maximum of $50 to a minimum of $100 and a maximum of $1,000. II. PURPOSE AND EFFECT The legislation is designed to create barriers to prostitution, to make it more difficult and expensive to engage in the business of prostitution in the hopes that the "professional prostitutes" will move on to another jurisdiction. These prostitutes are part of a circuit of prostitutes, creating an influx of prostitutes from other cities. Increasing penalties for prostitution and FTO is central to this strategy and remain as originally proposed. However, certain provisions of the bill have been eliminated or modified in the Committee Print as a result of testimony received during public hearings. The Committee Print: o Permits the release of photographs and other personal information of persons who have been convicted of a prostitution-related offense. Photographs of persons who have been an’ested 2 but not convicted could not be released. o Leaves the detention statute unchanged. o Permits the courts to require defendants to stay away from the area within which a prostitution offense occurred, as a condition of probation. o Clarifies that FTO applies to pedestrians, as well as motor vehicle operators. o Increases the fine for FrO. o Increases the fines and penalties for prostitution. o Amends the current civil forfeiture law to create a lien in favor of the District of Columbia in an amount equal to the cost of towing, storing, and processing vehicles seized and subject to civil forfeiture. The rationale behind increasing the fine for Failure to Obey, which is the most commonly used charge against street prostitutes, is to make prostitution economically unfeasible in the District of Columbia. Persons cited for FTO are often required to post collateral before being released. The current collateral is $50. Prostitutes will pay the $50, go back on the streets, not appear for trial, and forfeit the collateral. The increased fine will allow for a higher collateral, in the range of $200 to $300, which will be presumably less easy to sacrifice than $50. Collateral amounts are established by the D.C. Superior Court Board of Judges and are based on the size of the fine. D.C. Code § 23-111 l(b)(3) provides that persons arrested on misdemeanors (including FTO may be released on their own recognizance if the police officer issuing the citation has reason to believe that the arrested person will not cause injury or damage to persons or property and that the person will make an appearance in answer to the citation. Given this provision, it is more likely than not that prostitutes who live outside the jurisdiction will be required to post collateral, while those who are local residents will be given citation release. 1~II. LEGISLATIVE HISTORY September 18, 1995 October 25, 1995 Bill 11-439 introduced by Councilmember Lightfoot and referred to the Committee on the Judiciary. Hearings on Bill 11-439 December 13, 1995 Committee Mark-up 3 SECTION BY SECTION ANALYSIS Section I States the short title of Bill 11-439, the "Safe Streets Anti-Prostitution Amendment Act of 1995 Section 2 This section amends An Act To provide for the more effective prevention, detection and punishment of crime in the District of Columbia to authorize the Metropolitan Police Department to release to the public the name, address, date of birth, occupation, and photograph of any person convicted of a violation of the act, in exchange for a reasonable fee. Section 3 This section amends An Act For the suppression of prostitution in the District of Columbia. Subsection (a) increases the penalties for persons convicted of prostitution. The current penalties are $300 for the first offense, a fine of $300 and 10 days imprisonment for the second offense, and a fine of $300 and 90 days imprisonment for each subsequent offense. Bill 11-439 would raise the fine to $500 and no less than 1 day but no more than 90 days imprisonment for the 1st offense, a fine of $750 and no less than 1 day but no more than 135 days imprisonment for the 2nd offense, and a fine of $1,000 and no less than 1 day but no more than 180 days imprisonment for the 3rd and each subsequent offense. Subsection (b) provides that a judge may order a defendant accused of prostitution to stay away from the area within which the offense occurred, as a condition of probation. Subsection (c) creates a lien in favor of the District of Columbia in an amount equal to the cost of towing, storing, and administrative processing of a conveyance seized and subject to forfeiture. It provides that the Mayor shall set a reasonable cost and that the Corporation Counsel may agree to release of a lien by stipulation. Section 4 This section is a conforming and technical amendment to clarify that Failure to Obey has always applied to pedestrians and as well as operators of motor vehicles. Section 5 This section amends Title 18 of the District of Columbia Municipal Regulations. Subsection (a) amends section 2000.2 by adding a sentence to clarify that a pedestrian, as has always been the case, can be cited for Failure to Obey. 4 Subsection (b) amends section 2000.10 by increasing the fine for Fro. The current fine is not less than $10 and not more than $50. The fine will be increased to not less than $100 and not more than $1,000. Subsection (c) repeals section 2601.1. This is a technical and clarifying amendment. Subsection (d) repeals section 2603.1. Section 2603.1 lists the fine for Failure to Obey in the civil infractions section and sets the fine as $25. This is in conflict with the fine provided for in section 2000.10. To eliminate confusion and for clarity, this section is repealed. Section 6 This section states the fiscal impact. Section 7 This section states the effective date. V. SUMMARY OF PUBLIC HEARINGS Terry Paey, Steven A. Goldberg Company, testified that this legislation is needed to address the detrimental impact the prostitution problem is having on the tourism industry. Mr. Paey said that approximately 30 prostitutes congregate on the corner of 12th and K in front of his hotel, scaring away tourists. He said most of the prostitutes appear to be from out of town and are not threatened by the current fines for prostitution. Deputy Chief Philip A. O’Donnell, Commanding Officer, Support Services, testified that current laws against prostitution are inadequate. Chief O’Donnell said that the provisions in the proposed bill would address some of the problems in prostitution enforcement by increasing penalties. In fiscal year 1995, the Metropolitan Police Department made a total of 2,438 arrests for prostitution-related offenses, including soliciting prostitution, soliciting for lewd and immoral purposes, indecent sexual proposals and failure to obey Failure to obey" is a violation of the D.C. Municipal Regulations, which prohibits any citizen from disobeying a lawful order given by a police officer. It is often used as a tool in prostitution arrests where prostitution activity impedes traffic and the prostitutes refuse to obey the police officer’s order to move. During fiscal year 1995, the Metropolitan Police Department seized 88 vehicles from persons who were soliciting prostitutes. Chief O’Donnell supported the increased fines and penalties for prostitution but was concerned that the judges had too much discretion in imposing a sentence. He was strongly in favor of section 3 of the bill, which provides for a lien against conveyances seized by persons convicted of a prostitution offense. This lien would represent the cost of towing, storing and administrative processing of the vehicle, a cost he estimated to be $121 per vehicle. Chief O’Donnell was concerned that the increased penalty for Failure to Obey would result in more cases being adjudicated in the courts, although there would be an obvious deterrent value. 5 Robert Pittman, Adams Morgan Advisory Neighborhood Commission 1C-03, testified in support of Bill 11-439. He said that prostitution was mining the quality of life for residents of the community. He supports increasing fines and sentences for prostitution and supports allowing citizens the right to obtain the vital statistics and photographs of persons arrested on prostitution- related charges. Robert Rigsb¥, Deputy Corporation Counsel, Criminal Division provided the views of the executive on Bill 11-439. He testified that the "Duncan Ordinance" prohibits the police department from releasing personal information about an arrest unless the person was convicted or forfeited collateral and the arrestee consents. In order for the police to have the authority to release photographs of persons who were arrested, the "Duncan Ordinance" would have to be amended. Rigsby said that a condition of release which included a "stay away" order could only be imposed to ensure the appearance of the defendant or for the safety of another person and the community. He said that it would be unlikely that a prostitute would pose a threat to public safety in the usual sense of the word. In addition, he did not think a money bond should be used to assure the safety of the public. If a person poses a threat to the public, he or she should be detained, not released on bond. Finally, Rigsby was concerned that the increased fine for Failure to Obey might be unduly harsh. Jo-Ann Wallace, Director, and Robert Wilkins, Special Litigation Counsel, Public Defender Service opposed the bill in its entirety. In particular, Ms. Wallace was concerned about the repeal of D.C. Code § 23-1321(c)(3 which would allow the posting of a money bond to ensure public safety. Money bonds are supposed to be used to assure that a person charged with a crime shows up for trial, not to detain dangerous criminals. Using money bonds to detain dangerous criminals is unconstitutional, Ms. Wallace said. Instead, if a person is determined by the court to be dangerous, he or she should be detained prior to trial. The PDS also objected to the provisions in the bill allowing for the release of photographs of persons charged with prostitution crimes and giving the courts the authority to require a person charged with a prostitution-related offense to stay away from a particular area. Both of these provisions are unconstitutional, in the opinion of the PDS. Colin Dunham, President, Superior Court Trial Lawyers Association, testified in opposition to the bill, adopting the recommendations of the Public Defenders Service. Mary_ Jane DeFrank, Executive Director, American Civil Liberties Union opposed the bill in its entirety. The ACLU is particularly concerned about the provision that would repeal D.C. Code § 23-1321(c)(3 The repeal of section 23-1321(c)(3) would rewrite the law regarding bail and pretrial detention in all criminal cases, not just those involving prostitution. Under current law, suspects can be preventively detained if they are considered a threat to the community or who present a serious risk of flight. A judge may require the posting of bond in an amount necessary to assure appearance at trial, but it can not be used as a means of preventive detention. Under the provisions of the bill, the restrictions on the use of bond would be eliminated, allowing the judge to set bond purposely high as a means of preventive detention. Ms. DeFrank said the poor would 6 suffer the most, because they will be less likely to be able to meet bail. In addition, in Ms. DeFrank’s view, the increased penalties for prostitution are disproportionately high, resulting in more severe punishment for a repeat prostitution than a habitual thief. The increased penalties may drive prostitutes into more violent crimes. The provision allowing the court to order persons arrested for prostitution to stay away from certain areas, may violate the First Amendment of the Constitution, Ms. DeFrank testified. Finally, Ms. DeFrank opposed the increase in the fine for Failure to Obey because it invites abuse by the police and the provision allowing the distribution of photographs of persons accused of prostitution-related crimes because it violates Due Process. John Boardman and Mabel Boatwright, Local 82 testified in support of the legislation. Emily Durso Vetter, Presiden! of the Hotel Association of Washington, D.C testified that Bill 11-439 was necessary to preserve the quality of life in the District of Columbia, especially in Ward 2. In addition, the hotel business in D.C. competes with hotels in suburbia, where rates are lower and there is a perception that crime is lower. The presence of prostitutes discourages tourists and businesses from booking accommodations in the area. Marcia Rosenthall and Carrie Rutemiller, Franklin Square Association, testified in favor of the legislation. Ms. Rosenthall testified that the Franklin Square Association, which represents businesses in the Franklin Square area, supports policies that would reduce or eliminate the prostitution trade that is flourishing in their neighborhood. Ms. Rutemiller also testified on behalf of the Franklin Square Association in favor of Bill 11-439. Ms. Rutemiller stated that, although she supported the legislation, she believed that it did not go far enough. She supported a provision that would enable the prosecution to make a prima facie case of prostitution without establishing the exchange of money. She also favored provisions criminalizing the obstruction of traffic for prostitution purposes. She testified that she did support the provisions in the current bill establishing a lien in favor of the government and the increased fines and penalties for prostitution and Failure to Obey. Don Minkler, Member, Potomac Hotel Group, testified in support of the legislation. Phillip A. Doyle, Irene Williams, Mary_ Boyde, Ernestine Baker, and Dollie Tann, all representing Days Inn, Downtown, located at 12th and K Streets, N.W testified from their own personal experiences, on the need to enact Bill 11-439. Bill Selak, private individual, testified concerning his experiences as an employee of the Close Up Foundation, which rented rooms for participants in their program, all of whom are minors, at the Days Inn, Downtown. He said the continued presence of prostitutes around the Days Inn would probably force the program to seek accommodations elsewhere. Rudi Bertschenger, Henley Park Hotel, testified in support of the legislation. 7 Bill Petrella, Morrison Clark, testified in support of the legislation. Helen Kramer, President, Logan Circle Community Association, testified that the people in her community struggled daily with the prostitution problem. Ms. Kramer said that prostitution is not a victimless crime. It increases the volume of noise and littering in the community, and creates a bad environment for children. She believes that increasing the fine for Failure to Obey will have an economic impact on the prostitution trade and make D.C. a less desirable place for prostitutes. Eric Korpon, Logan Circle Community Association, testified in support of the legislation. He provided a videotape which showed prostitution activity in front of him home on 12th St N.W. at various hours. Laura Shell, Old City Coalition Citizens Patrol, testified in support of the legislation. Her group patrols the neighborhood and knows the type of problems the prostitution trade can create. Leslie Miles, Blagden Alley Association, testified that her neighborhood has been troubled by transvestite prostitution. She testified to the detrimental effect that the prostitution trade has on families attempting to raise children in the area. She was in favor of the increased fine for failure to obey stay away" order for prostitution offenders and increased penalties for persons convicted of prostitution-related offenses. Melvin F. Brown, President, O Street Community Association, testified about the increase in trash, noise and crime in his area, which is frequented by prostitutes. He said that tougher laws, including an increase in the fine for failure to obey, would help in attacking the problem. Robert Riddle, ANC Commissioner, 2F05, testified in favor on the legislation. He is especially concerned about the impact witnessing prostitution-related activity has on young children. Grace Bradford, Asbur~ United Methodist Church, testified that her church, located at 1 lth and K Streets, N.W has been affected by prostitution activity. She testified that increases in penalties would be a help, but that an increase in counseling services is also needed. Ruth Burness, a resident of the Thomas House Retirement Home testified in favor of the legislation. Dorothy Boyd, City Center Hotel, testified in support of the legislation. Nancy Riker, Owner, Washington DC Accommodations, testified that the city must do everything it can to encourage and support the tourism industry. She said that customers are discouraged from seeking accommodations in areas frequented by prostitutes. VI. FISCAL IMPACT STATEMENT The Metropolitan Police Department has forwarded a fiscal impact statement indicating that the MPD will perform the new requirements of the law as part of their on-going functions and with no new resources needed. The Department of Corrections has forwarded a fiscal impact statement estimating that the provisions in section 3 which increase the f’mes and penalties for prostitution will cost $9 million over a 6 year period. Section 3 sets the penalty for the first offense of prostitution at no less than 1 day and no more than 90 days. Current law imposes only a $300 fine for first offense. Corrections’ analysis is based on the assumption that all persons confined for prostitution will be confined for 90 days. Currently, the Department of Corrections estimates that there are 29 persons incarcerated each month and assumes that all of these persons will be incarcerated, under the new law, a full 90 days. Based on this assumption, the change in law would increase yearly costs by $1,760,810. However, the Department is assuming a worst- case scenario and a more realistic assumption is that only a handful of persons convicted of prostitution would receive 90 days in jail under the new law. VII. IMPACT ON EXISTING LAW Bill 11-439 amends An Act To provide for the more effective prevention, detection and punishment of crime by adding a new subsection that will authorize the police to release the name, address, date of birth, occupation, and photographs of a person convicted of a prostitution offense, including soliciting and procuring. It also amends An Act For the suppression of prostitution in the District of Columbia by increasing the penalties for persons convicted of prostitution and by specifying that a judge can order a person convicted of prostitution to stay away from the area where the offense occurred as a condition of probation. The existing provisions regarding forfeiture of vehicles seized from persons engaging in prostitution-related activities are amended to create a lien in favor of the District of Columbia to pay the costs associate with storing, towing and administrative processing of vehicles. Chapter 18 of the D.C. Municipal Regulations is amended to increase the fine for Failure to Obey and to clarify that FTO applies to pedestrians as well as motor vehicle operators. VIII. COMMITTEE ACTION The Committee on the Judiciary met on December 13, 1995 to consider Bill 11-439, the "Safe Streets Anti Prostitution Amendment Act of 1995 The following councilmembers were present, constituting a quorum: William P. Lightfoot, Jack Evans, and Kevin Chavous. All voted to approve Bill 11-439 as follows: 9 Bil 21 Vote R e e. e.e.e.e.e.e, e~Vote Lightfoot yes Lightfoot yes Evans yes Evans yes Chavous yes Chavous yes There were no amendments proposed or accepted to the draft Committee Print. Councilmember Lightfoot expressed the concerns that local prostitutes, who turn to prostitution primarily to support their drug addiction and who are almost universally poor, will be forced to languish in jail because they cannot pay the collaterial for Failure to Obey. However, statistics provided by the Metropolitan Police Department indicate that the majority of arrests, 67 of 113, for PTO during the period of July 1, 1995 through November 30, 1995, occurred in Police Districts 1D, 2D, and 3D, the area with the greatest concentration of street prostitutes.

The Council of the District of Columbia finds that the fiscal impact of this act will be as follows: The Metropolitan Police Department has forwarded a fiscal impact statement indicating that the MPD will perform the new requirements of the law as part of their on-going functions and with no new resources needed. The Department of Corrections has forwarded a fiscal impact statement estimating that the provisions in section 3 which increase the fines and penalties for prostitution will cost $9 million over a 6-year period. Section 3 sets the penalty for the first offense of prostitution at no less than 1 day and no more than 90 days. Current law imposes only a $300 fine for first offense. Corrections’ analysis is based on the assumption that all persons confined for prostitution will be confined for 90 days. Currently, the Department of Corrections estimates that there are 29 persons incarcerated each month and assumes that all of these persons will be incarcerated, under the new law, a full 90 days. Based on this assumption, the change in law would increase yearly costs by $1,760,810. However, the Department is assuming a worst- case scenario and a more realistic assumption is that only a handful of persons convicted of prostitution would receive 90 days in jail under the new law.

See.2. Section 389 (67 Stat. 99: D.C, Code § 4-135 The court takes no position on this section. 2. S~c.3(a Section l(a 49 Stat. 651" D.C. Code § 22-2701(a The court is in favor of increasing the maximum sentence for convictions under this statute. However, the court would not favor any mandatory minimum sentence. The administration of criminal justice is better served when the courts have complete discretion to fashion an appropriate sentence. Moreover, a mandatory rrfinimurn free of $500.00 could result in a dramatic increase in the demand on the court’s time and resources in its efforts to enforce such a fine. Enforcement proceedings would include, but would not be limited to, the scheduling of show cause hearings to evaluate and determine one’s ability to pay, the issuance of summons and the issuance of bench warrants when defendants fail to appear. The court supports an overall increase in the maximum penalty so as to give the court sufficient leverage to supervise, treat, and prevent individuals from reengaging in prostitution. However, the court suggests that it be given maximum latitude and 10/20/95 17:02 ~202 879 7830 dc-superlor ct 003/004 discretion without the imposition of any mandatory minimum. Accordingly, the court suggests that D.C.

Code § 22-2703 The court supports the proposed amendments to this section as these are the types of treatment measures needed to rehabilitate persons who have been involved in prostitution. Moreover, these measures are typical of the conditions normally and routinely imposed by the court under existing law as conditions of probation. S¢c.3 (e Section 5 (49 Stat. 65I; D.C. Code § 22-2723 The court takes no position on this section. Sec.4 (a D.C.

See.4 D.C. Code § 23-I 321(c)(3 The court is in favor of this provision, for the court is in dire need of authority to impose a reasonable monetary condition "to reasonably assure reappearance of defendants who have no ties to the District of Columbia or metropolitan area.

IIIII Attachment 6 October 24, 1995 Counciimember Jack Evans Cotm¢il of the District of Columbia Washington, D,C. 20004 Dear Councilmember Evans, In response to your request for information from the Superior Court on the effect of the Safe Streets Amendment Act of]99£ Bill 11-439, the following answers to your quefdons are respectfully submitted: 1. The number of prostitution and solicitation eases pending in the D.C. Super/or Court at this time According to court records, there are 117 prostitution or solicitation cases pending before the conn. The estimated number of new prostitution and solicitation cases to be filed in the future As you know, the workload of the court is driven primarily by the activities of the various police departments and prosecutors in the District of Columbia. Although prostitution and solicitation cases tend to increase in the summer months, it is difficult to speculate with any degree of certainty at the number of future arrests because this number is dependent solely on the activities of Executive Branch agencies. The chart below indicates the monthly filings from January through September of this year. Monthly Arreits for Prostitution June Au( ust ~apb rtber 10/~4i95 13:20 ~2028794829 D.C. Courts Historical data on the dbpositlon of prostitution and solicitation eases The vast majority ofprostimtlon end solicitation cases are calendared for trial at arraignment, Specifically, 558 cases (8g were calendared for trial, while only 50 cases (8 were no-papered, The average number of days between arraignment and trial is 47.41 days. 4 The amount of frees to be imposed pursuant to Bill 11-439 The court’s records reflect that there have been 636 filings for prostitution and solicitation in 1995. The difficulty in extrapolating an exact dollar figure in terms of flues is caused by the high incidence of rearrest in these eases. Specifically, Bill 11-439 creates increased fines for second offenses and for subsequent offenses after a second offense. Although court records reflect that ~t4 defendants have been arrested twice, 7 defendan~ have been arrested three times, 2 defendants have been arrested four times, and 1 defendant has been arrested five times, it is still incumbent upon the prosecutor to file repeat papers in order for a defendant to be subject to repest offender status and thus, the greater fines. The number of eases affected by the repeal of D.C, Code §23-1321(c)(3 and any cost associated with disposition of these cases The repeal of D.C. Code §23-1321(c)(3) would affect all of the cases that come through arraignment court in which the defendant is not detained under D.C. Code §23- 1322 or §23-1325. Also affected would be ail cases in wh/ch a defendant is initially detained under either D.C. Code §23-1322 or §23-1325, moves the court for modification of conditions of release, and is released under conditions provided in D.C. Code §23- 1321. Bill 11-439 deletes the code section restricting the imposition of financial conditions that result in the detention of defendants. The projected impact on the court resulting from the repeal of D.C. Code §23- 1321(c)(3) would be minimal. On the contrary, it is almost certain that the impact on the Depe.qment of Corrections would be significant, Prior to the amendment of the Bail Reform Act in 1992 that limited the instances in which a monetary condition restricting any defendant’s liberty could be imposed, there were approximately 375 defendants committed 1o the D.C. Jail in a pretrial or presentence status on a money bond at any given time. Even with the legislative changes in 1992, which were further restricted with additional amendments in 1994, there remains approximately 200 defendants detained on money bonds. If the prohibition against the preventive detention of defendants on money bonds is repealed, it is inevitable that the number of defendants committed as a result will increese. Recently, the Department of Corrections estimated that the cost of housing pretrial and presentence defendants committed only on money bonds is nearly 000,000 per year. 10/24/0~ 1~:21 ~202879~82~ D.C.

Any action taken by the Board of Judges or the Bond and Co]lateral Committee regard/ng the eoIIateral amount for prostitution, soHeltatiou, or failure to obey offenses ¯ On Sept~mbe~ 15, 1995, the Board of .Judges ordered Superior Court 1 I?(c) mended to expand the jurisdiction of commission~r~ I~ include offer~cs i ~se, cutcd pursuit to D.C. Code §22-2701(a for which the defendant is prosecmed as a fu’st ofl’¢nd This ~tmcndm~ut was enacted with the intention of avoiding the addition of a large number of filings to the six misdemeanor calendars presided over by judges with already massive caseloads. Cases in which defendants are prosecuted as repeat offenders will be heard by judges. Additionally, I informed the Me~-opolium Police Department on July 7, 1995, that police o~cers, acting as Cle~k~ of the Superior Court for the purpose of receiving collateral or bond, had orrantly been requiring persons arrested pursuant to D.C. Code §22-2701 to post $I000, I advised that the court had an established bond of $500 for such cases. 7. The bill’s affect, Jf any, on the caseloads of judges and hearing commissioners Presently, there is an average of 71 filings per month for solicitation and prostitution cases, with a noticeable spike in filings in the summer months, Any affect on c~eloads will depend in large part on the increased activity of Executive Branch agencies. A listing of additional resources, ff any, the court would require in order to implement Bill 11-439 It is premature to predict if the com-t will r~uira additional resources to implemont Bill 11-439 because of the uncertainty of the activities of the police and prosecutors, but I respectfully reserve the right to revisit rids issue with you as the need arises. Please let me know if I can provide further information or emswer any additional que~ons on the projected effect of the Safe Streets Amendment Act of 199 Bill 11-439. Eu e~ne N, Hamilton Chief Judge Attachment 7 PROPOSED PROSTITUTION LEGISLATION Testimony of Terry Peay, Executive Vice President of The Stephen A. Goldberg Company. Mr. Chairman and Members of the City Council My name is Terry Peay. I am the Executive Vice President of the Stephen A. Goldberg Co a real estate developer and property owner in the District of Columbia. I would like to thank you for taking the time to consider, and I sincerely hope, pass this important piece of legislation that is before you. For the past several months, I have heard a tremendous outcry for help from the downtown residential community, various business groups and most importantly of all, the Washington Metropolitan Police Department, the Courts the U.S. Attorney’s Office and Corporation Council regarding the prostitution problem that plagues our city. The District of Columbia’s prostitution problem was brought into sharp focus one evening when I was driving downtown. At the corner of 12~h &amp;amp; K, in front of our hotel, I witnessed approximately 130 prostitutes congregating on the street corner They were accostlng our guests as they were coming in and out of the hotel. Many of the prostitutes were practically nude, and some were charging students of the Close Up Foundation $5.00 per student for them to have their photographs taken with a D.C. prostitute. A great souvenir to take home and show their parents. The prostitutes were so brazen that even with a police car parked on the street, they wouldn’t disburse immediately. One of our security guards was speaking to a prostitute and she told him that she was making $70,000 a year, driving a Corvette, and she wasn’t about to stop conducting business for a mere $50 fine. The prostitutes appear to be from out of state and their pimps are well organized with cellular phones and street maps. The pimps direct the prostitutes where to go when the police show up. As you all know, tourism is one of the leading industries in the District of Columbia and I cannot begin to tell you the devastating effect that prostitution has on business. We were told by a law enforcement agency, the F.B.I, various student groups and many other tourist groups that they were afraid to stay at our hotel for fear of being accosted in the evenings by the prostitutes. The fact that you could look out~of the hotel windows and witness numerous sex acts going on b6th across the street and in the alley is very disconcerting The Washington Metropolitan Police Department, the courts and the U.S. Attorney General’s office have all expressed a desire to help and they have made an attempt to do so. Without increases in the fines and possibly mandatory jail sentences the prostitutes are right back out on the street the same evening to conduct business. I ask you on behalf of all parties concerned that you pass this very important piece of legislation that is before you. I want to make a special note of thanks to Councilman Jack Evans who has tirelessly appeared before all of the various groups and has lent his support, and for the Committee Chairman, Bill Lightfoot’s attendance at our last meeting and his support. Attachment 8 GOVERNMENT OF THE DISTRICT OF COLU~UJ METROPOLITAN POLICE DEPARTMENT NOV 2 o 1995 The Honorable Jack Evans Councilmember, Ward Two Council of the District of Columbia 1350 Pennsylvania Avenue, N.W. Washington, D.C. 20004 Dear Councilmember Evans: This is in response to your recent request for clarification of the Metropolitan Police Department’s support for Bill 11-439, the "Safe Streets Anti-Prostitution Emergency Amendment Act of 1995,’° which is designed to combat prostitution. First and foremost, let me assure you that it is the policy of the Metropolitan Police Department to enforce all laws and regulations enacted in the District of Columbia. The Metropolitan Police Department also remains committed to any legislation designed to disrupt and eliminate prostitution activities within the District of Columbia. Our position on this legislative proposal was set forth previously in the prepared testimony of Deputy Chief Philip A. O’Donnell, that was delivered to the Committee on the Judiciary in October, 1995. We will not repeat all of those comments here. However, as stated in the testimony, we believe that Bill 11-439 does address some problems in prostitution enforcement by adopting stricter sentencing requirements and by increasing the sanctions against violators of the prostitution laws. We also believe that there is a need for careful consideration of the impact that these changes will have if the bill is enacted into law. For example, the increased penalty for disobeying the "Laxvful Order or Direction of Police Officer has obvious deterrent values. As you know, this law is intended to augmei~t pedestrian and vehicular traffic regulations. It is not solely related to prostitution enforcement, yet it remains a useful tool for officers involved with the control of prostitution activities. The problem as we see it is that the increased penalty may cause defendants t6 challenge their arrests, resulting in more officers being taken from the streets to handle court hearings. We feel that other legislation similar to the loitering for purposes of prostitution eftbrts that failed court review here some years ago would be more beneficial than merely increasing the penalty for disobeying an officer’s order. We offered several other ideas in our testimony and we hope that the Council would give serious consideration to them. P.O. Box 1606, Washington, D.C. 20013-1606 The Honorable Jack Evans Council of the District of Columbia Page Two Once again, let me emphasize that we support your efforts to develop laws that will assist the Metropolitan Police Department in its efforts to combat prostitution. We trust that this is responsive to your request. If you have any additional questions, please notify me. Sincerely, ¯ Soulsby Interim Chief of Police Attachment 9 TESTIMONY BEFORE THE COMMITTEE ON THE JUDICIARY A PUBLIC HEARING ON BILL 11-439, THE "SAFE STREETS ANTI-PROSTITUTIONAMENDMENT ACT OF 1995" Good afternoon Chairman Lightfoot and members of the Committee on the Judiciary. I am Deputy Chief Philip A. O’Donnell, Commanding Officer of Support Services, Metropolitan Police Department. I am pleased to appear today representing Interim Chief of Police Larry D. Soulsby, to present testimony regarding Bill ii- 439, the "Safe Streets Anti-Prostitution Amendment Act of 1995 It is the policy of the Metropolitan Police Department to enforce all laws and regulations in the District of Columbia. At present, laws relating to the enforcement of prostitution- related crimes fail to adequately curtail the continued proliferation of these offenses. In Fiscal Year 1995, the Metropolitan Police Department recorded a total of 2,438 arrests for prostitution-related offenses; not included in these figures are juvenile arrests and arrests made by other law enforcement agencies. These arrests are broken down as follows: Soliciting Prostitution 433 Soliciting for Lewd and Immoral Purposes 420 Indecent Sexual Proposal 39 Failure to Obey Total 2,438 The 1,546 arrests for Failure violations of Title 18 of the to Obey were for District of Columbia Municipal Regulations (DCMR which prohibits any citizen from disobeying a lawful order given by a police officer. This law is used as a tool in areas known for prostitution, and where vehicular and pedestrian traffic is impeded in flagrant violation. The vast majority of these arrests were made in the First and Third Police Districts where the heaviest concentration of street prostitution is located in the Franklin Square and Logan Circle communities. Most of these arrests were made during late night and early morning hours. During Fiscal Year 1995, Department the Metropolitan Police seized 88 vehicles for violations of D.C. Code 22-2701 Inviting for Purposes of Prostitution It is the belief of the Metropolitan Police Department that Bill 11-439, entitled Safe Streets Anti-Prostitution Amendment Act of 1995 addresses some of the problems in prostitution enforcement by adopting stricter sentencing requirements and levying greater sanctions against violators of laws governing prostitution. The Act provides for an amendment to District of Columbia Code 4-135 by providing the name, address, date of birth, occupation and photograph of an arrestee to the public. As you are aware, all information, excluding the photograph, of all adult arrestees appears on departmental arrest books which are available to the public for inspection, at no cost to the reviewer. Releasing the photographs of persons arrested for prostitution offenses may serve as a deterrent in some communities, in that it exposes the identity of the arrestee and it alerts citizens in the community of those individuals likely to carry out activities associated with prostitution. However, careful consideration must be given to the publication and circulation of these photographs because of the propens i ty these individuals to such offenses to expose as stalking, blackmail, or other acts of retaliation. Section 3 of the act provides for more stringent sentences and fines against those guilty of prostitution-related offenses, which we all agree are needed to abate prostitution. However, in the past, the court has permitted individuals found guilty of prostitution offenses six to eight months to make payment on imposed minimum or discretionary fines. Following these arrangements, many individuals simply move on to other localities without satisfying their sentencing requirements. It is estimated that 85% of the prostitutes arrested in this city are transient. Prostitutes are known to travel an informal circuit throughout the United States, visiting sporting events, conventions, and other high profile events in various cities. This transient behavior affords them the opportunity to avoid the arrests and sentencing requirements of many jurisdictions. In the past, the court has permitted the time incarcerated pending arraignment (which is usually no more than one to two days to substitute for the imprisonment clause of the Bill. It is recommended that a provision be included in this legislation as deemed appropriate by the Committee which limits the discretion of the court in matters of sentencing. The Metropolitan Police Department fully endorses the stay away provisions of the Act which provides additional security to the community and serves as a deterrent. The Department also fully endorses the power of the court to order submission to medical and mental examinations by defendants when deemed appropriate. Many defendants suffer from physical and psychological illnesses. Section 3 of the act also provides for a lien against the conveyances of those guilty of prostitution offenses in favor of the District of Columbia in an amount equal to the cost of towing, storing and administrative processing of a conveyance seized pursuant to this law. It is estimated that the average cost associated with the seizure of each vehicle is $121.00. Approximately 90 minutes is used to impound each vehicle. An additional four hours are used to process the impounded vehicle. The average hourly rate associated with these seizures is $22.00. This section of the legislation will surely aid in curtailing the cost of associated expenses. The increased penalty for disobeying the "Lawful Order or Direction of Police Officer has obvious deterrent values, result in more cases but may inevitably being adjudicated in the courts. This will require more officers to attend court, making them less available for regular street and investigative duties. It must be emphasized that this .law is intended to augment pedestrian and vehicular traffic regulation, and it is not solely prostitution enforcement. Other related to legislation along these avenues limited to prostitution enforcement may need consideration. While this law has much substance, it may not adequately address the most significant problems associated with prostitution, the pandering and procurement practices responsible of pimps. Pimps are for the continuous influx of prostitution into our city. In addition to prostitution, they encourage crimes of violence, pornography, drug trafficking, and the deterioration of families. Any additional legislation that does not consider increased enforcement against these individuals will not address the core of reasons I offer the the problem. For these following alternatives which I feel should be taken into consideration with this bill: TARGETING PIMPS D.C. Code 22-2705 Pandering 22-2706 Compelling a Life of Prostitution and 22- 2707 Procuring specifically pertain to female victims. These statutes should be amended to include any person rather than the limitation to just females. Males as well as females fall victim to the cunning behavior of pimps dditionally, these statutes should provide an enhanced penalty whenever the victim is under 18 years of age. TRANSPORTATION FOR PROSTITUTION ¯ Presently, the District of Columbia has no laws prohibiting transportation for the purposes of prostitution solely within this jurisdiction. Often times, prostitutes and their pimps are seen traveling throughout the city but are careful to avoid interstate transportation because of federal guidelines involving the Mann Act, which is interstate transportation prostitution. for the purpose of Furthermore, the surrounding jurisdictions, Maryland and Virginia, have such laws prohibiting the transportation for prostitution within their respective states. Enacting legislation prohibiting this type of transportation would provide an additional tool for combating prostitution enforcement against pimps, customers, or anyone with an interest in utilizing transportation to facilitate prostitution. LOITERING FOR PROSTITUTION Numerous locations within the District have historically been known for prostitution activities. The majority of our prostitution arrests are made in these areas. Individuals known to engage in prostitution activities have characteristics indicative to this trade. A law prohibiting one from loitering in these known areas, for the purpose of prostitution, would also aid as an enforcement tool. Currently, New York State has legislation which prohibits loitering for the purpose of prostitution. We should review that legislation, as well as similar legislation for possible adoption here. In closing, the Metropolitan Police Department remains committed to any legislation designed to disrupt and eliminate prostitution activities within the District of Columbia.

Attachment 12 COMMENTS OF THE PUBLIC DEFENDER SERVICE FOR THE DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA concerning THE SAFE STREETS ANTI-PROSTITUTION AMENDMENT ACT OF 1995 Bill 11-439 presented by Robert L. Wilkins Acting Special Litigation Counsel before THE COMMITTEE ON THE JUDICIARY COUNCIL OF THE DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA The Honorable William P. Lightfoot, Chair October 25, 1995 Jo-Ann Wallace Director Public Defender Service 451 Indiana Avenue, N.W. Washington, D.C. 20001 (202) 628-1200 ChalrmanLightfoot, members of the Judiciary Committee, thank you for the opportunity to testify about the Safe Streets Anti-Prostltutlon Amendment Act of 1995, Our first and foremost priority here today is to express our extreme concern that this bill proposes to ellmlnate D.C. Code 23-1321(c)(3 We strongly oppose this provision of the leglslation. Its clear intent is to reinstitute the repeatedly discredited Practice of allowing poor people to be detained Indefinitely without any of the procedural safeguards contained in the bail laws~ In addition to raising constitutional concerns this proposal is bad pollcy. It has nothing to do with public safety. Money bonds are supposedly used to make sure a person charged with a crime shows up for trial, not to lock up people for long periods, of time. When such a provision was last before the Council it was opposed by the United States Attorney and the Pretrial Services Agency, as well as the Public Defender Service, and it is uniformly disfavored by the Department of Corrections and the defense bar. Fortunately, the p~ovision was eventually elimlnated from the Safe Streets Anti-Prostitution Emergency Amendment Act of 1995. It should be rejected again and flnally lald to rest. Eliminating D.C. Code 23-1321(c)(3) would upset the balance of the entire, carefully structured bail statute, because this provision serves a number of important purposes. To truly appreciate this point, we must look brlefly to the history of thls provision in particular and the bail statute in general. The Supreme Court has declared time add time again that "[i]n our society liberty is the norm, and detention prior to trlal or without trial is the carefully limited exception United States v.Salerno, 481 U.S. 739, 755 (1987 Thus, the Supreme Court end the Court of Appeals of the District of Columbia have mandated numerous procedural safegaurds and llmitations on whena person may be locked up in jail before they even have a trlal, after what kind of hearing and for how long. I_~d. Se e generally Lynch v. United States, 557 A.2d 580 (D.C. 1989 en banc Kleinbart v. United States, 604 A.2d 861 (D.C, 1992 Our statute provides that criminal defendants can be preventively detained (held in jail without bond and with no possibility of release before trial) if he or she is such a danger to the¯ community that no type of conditions could assure the community’s safety if that person were to be released. See D.C. Code S 23- 1322(b)(2 A person can be preventively detained based on dangerousness if they are charged with certain types of dangerous or violent crimes. D.C. Code 23-1322(c)(i 4 A person can also be preventivelydetained if he or she is such a risk of flight that no set of conditions could assure their return to court if they were to be released. D.C. Code 23-1322(b)(1)(D Under the current statutory scheme, without the proposed amendment, a person can be preventively detained b~sed on risk of flight in any misdemeanor or felony case, including on a solicitation charge. However, before a defendant may be preventively detained, both the statute and the courts have 2 declared that he or she is entltled to certain rights, Including a hearing where the government must prove byclear and convincing evidence that preventive detentlon’is justified. If aldefendant Is preventlvely detained, he or she has a right to trial within no more than 100 days from the beginning of their detention. D.C. Code S 23-1322(h D.C. Code 23-1321(c)(3)I, which was last amended by the ¯Omnibus Criminal Justice Reform Amendment Act of 1994, has several purposes, but it was primarily intended to prohibit su b ro__adetention ’invidious discrimination’ whereby a person remains incarcerated solely because of his limited flnancial means Russell v. United States, 131U.S. App. D.C. 44, 45, 402 F.2d 187, 188 (1968).2 The statute allows the court to set a bond in an amount necessary to assure the defendant’s presence at future court proceedings, and higher or lower bonds can be set depending upon the judge’s assessment of the defendant’s risk of flight. However, section 1321(c)(3) provides that if a judge sets a bond too high for the defendant to make, then that judge That section currentlyprovides: A judicial officer may not Imposea financial condition under paragraph (1)(B)(xil) or (xill) of this subsection [the money bond provisions] to assure the safety of any other person or the community, but may impose such a financlal condition to reasonably assure the defendant’s presence at all court proceedings that does not result in the preventive detention of the person, except as provided in 23-1322(b 2 Se e qenerally Testimony of John A. Carver III, Esq Director of the District of Columbla Pretrial Services Agency, from the hearings on the Omnibus Crlminal Justice Reform Amendment Act of 1994 (attached 3 shoulddo either one of two things. First, the Judge should determine if a lower bond or other conditions such as electronic monitoring or third-party custody would assure the defendant’s presence in court. If so, then the judge should make that adjustment. Second, if the judge believes that the bond should notbe reduced or other conditions imposed, then the court and the government should treat the defendant as a preventive detention case, giving the defendant all of the rights to which she is entitled. Section 1321(c)(3) prohibits the court from allowing people to languish in jail indefinitely solely because they cannot afford to make bond, without the procedural rights to which they are entitled. Thus section 1321(c)(3) enforces the important constltutional principle that criminal defendants should not be discriminated against and afforded less rights solely because they are poor.3 Eliminating this section would disrupt the currently orderly interplay between the various statutory provisions and create confusion in the administration of bail and the detention procedures in the courts.

Mr. Johnson, along with his successor, current United States Attorney Eric Holder, joined us and the Pretrlal Services Agency to fight any efforts by the 1994 Omnibus Act to reinstate sub rosa detention. Furthermore, ellminating section 1321(c)(3) would have a serious negative impact on the District. Even under the~current scheme, hundreds of people sit in jail for long periods of time because they cannot make the bond which is set for them. At some point, such indivlduals get back to court to try to get their bonds reduced, and many are eventually successful. In the meantime, however, they occupy much needed jail space at a~great cost to District taxpayers. Department of Corrections and court officials have determined that the cost of people sitting in jail unnecessarily because they cannot make their money bonds is millions of dollars per year. To alleviate this problem, the Mayor proposed a bill earlier this year to require defendants to be returned to court within five days if they cannot make their money bonds. Elimlnating section 1321(c)(3 as proposed by this bill, would only exacerbate the problem of overcrowding and be more costly to the city~ In conclusion we slncerely hope that proposals to ellmlnate the protections in section 1321(c)(3) are flnally laid to rest. We would urge the Committee to reject this proposal. 5 Section two of this bill proposes to make the name, address, date of birth, occupation and photograph of anyone arrested for a prostltutlon-related offense available to the public’The police departmentCurrently does not release arrest photographs to the publlc. Currently, MPD will release an arrest photograph to an accused in response to a subpoena by his or her attorney, but a specific court order is required for anyone other than the counsel of the arrestee to obtain an arrest photograph. The current practice reflects the seriousness with which the police department and the courts treat "mug shots" and arrest photographs, which are private and extremely prejudiclal. This provision of the bill dangerously departs from that long-standing practice without sufficlent Justlflcation. The provision makes confidential information provided to the police by a presumptively innocent person public information. It is unfair. The information available to the public should be the public record: the court file. If the arrestee is officially charged by the United States Attorney, then the court file will contain the Pretrial Services Agency report, which documents the arrestee’s name, address, date of birth, occupation and prior criminal record. However, not everyone who is arrested by the pollce is prosecuted bythe United States Attorney. This bill would mandate the release of confidentlal information and photographs of those arrestees--people who are never even formally charged. This provision of the bill will result in unfair branding and labeling of people akin to a modern day 6 "Scarlet Letter based simply on an arrest, even if no official charges are brought, charges are filed but later dismissed or they are acquitted Such anextreme measure is unwise and unwarranted even in when a person is convicted of this misdemeanor offense. Branding a person for llfe by publlshlng a photograph would severely Intervere with the rehabilitatlve goals of the crlminal Justice system. Men and women who get Involved in prostitution-related activity are often young, and fortunately, It usually is not a life-long occupation. I am presently trying to assist a woman who was convicted of sollcltation over twelve years ago. It was her first and last arrest. She had just moved to the District and was young when it happened. She is married now, she has a different last name, and she has turned her life around. But this conviction still haunts her. It haunts her when she thinks about applying for a job. It haunts her when she thinks about family members, including her children, finding out. She would like to expunge that conviction, but there is really not much of anything that can be done. Publishing photographs of persons in this woman’s situation would only exacerbate such problems. Society loses when we create impedimients that prevent people from being productive members of a community. This bill also proposes to expand a Judge’s power to order people arrested for sollcltlatlon to stay away from a particular locatlon pending trlal or after sentencing, for the entire time that they are placed on probation. This provision will qulckly find challenge in the courts, because it impacts on constitutionally guaranteedrlghts of freedom of movement, association and travel. Se e Attorney General of New York v. S~o-Lopez~ 476 U.S. 898, 901 (1986 Under the current law ii~i~people are sometlmesordered to stay away from a partlcular ~1ocatlon pending trial if there is a potential threat to witnesses or people at the locatlon. Se e In re A.H 459 A.2d 1045 (D.C. 1983 However, this provision appears to contemplate that such orders may be made in the routine sollcitation case where danger to witnesses or potential violence is not a concern. This bill also makes such a ,stayaway" order an option for probation, which can last up to five years. This extreme measure can result in the .severance of positive community ties, and be a severe impediment to rehabilitation. This proposed expansion of the authority to issue a "stayaway" order is unnecessary, unconstitutlonal and should be rejected. In conclusion, we belleve that this bill has several problematic sections which should be rejected by the Judiciary Committee and the full Council. We urge the Committee to report the bill unfavorably to the Council. Attachment 13 TESTIMONY OF MARY JANE DEFRANK ~dVIERICAN CIVIL LmERTIES UNION OF THE NATIONAL CAPITAL AREA BEFORE THE COMMITTEE ON THE JUDICIARY REGARDING BILL 11-439 "SAFE STREETS ANTI-PROSTITUTION AMENDMENT ACT OF 1995 October 25, 1995 The American Civil Liberties Union of the National Capital Area appreciates the opportunity to testify before the Committee on the Judiciary regarding Bill 11-439, the "Safe Streets Anti- Prostitution Amendment Act of 1995 My name is Mary Jane DeFrank, and I am the executive director of the ACLU of the National Capital Area. The ACLU understands the concern of residents and businesses about the problems associated with the.presence of prostitution in their neighborhoods. However, this bill unnecessarily intrudes upon individual liberty and due process. Furthermore, many of its provisions would do little to limit criminal activity; in fact, they may have the exact opposite effect. Finally, one provision of the bill does not address prostitution, but proposes a radical change in the law regarding pretrial detention in criminal cases. Parenthetically, I would like to mention that this sweeping bail provision was offered in a similar anti-prostitution bill on emerqency leqislation in July 1995. District residents are ill served bythe abuseof emergency legislation procedures which make sweeping changes in the criminal justice system. For these reasons, we oppose this legislation and respectfully ask the Council to defeat it. Section Four is not Gerw_~a~e to the Rest of the Bill and Proposes an Evisceration of Existinq Law Protectinq the Freedom From Excessive Bail Section 4 of the bill is the most onerous. In a bill purporting to deal solely with prostitution, this section proposes a complete reworking of the law regarding bail and pretrial detention not justfor prostitution arrests, but in all criminal cases. This Council has dealt with the issue of bail recently, in the Bail Reform Amendment Act of 1992. That law already greatly increases the number of suspects held without bond pending trial Bail Law’s Results Mixed Washinqton Post, September 4, 1992, D1 Now, if this bill is passed, the rights of the accused will be dealt another harsh blow. The District of Columbia already has the highest rate of incarceration in the United States and a very high rate of preventive detention. Under current law, suspects can be preventively detained who are considered a threat to the community and have been accused of a "dangerous or violent crime crime of obstructing justice; serious risk the defendant will obstruct justice or will flee. For other suspects, a judge may only require the posting of a bail bond or other collateral in an amount necessary to assure appearance at trial. This bill repeals the extremely fair section of the existing bail law that forbids the use of bail as a means of preventive detention. This bill would allow a judge to set bail in any amount, without regard to the defendant’s ability to pay, and without regard to the requirement that preventive detention be restricted to individuals who have been found at a separate hearing 2 to be a threat to the community. This provision creates the possibility of bondless detention for anyone facing trial in the District. The tradition of liberty .in this country is a firmly rooted one. A person cannot be convicted of a crime without being found guilty beyond a reasonable doubt. Even the pretrial detention of potentially dangerous defendants is based upon clear and convincing evidence of a threat to the safety of the community. But if this bill becomes law, a person may be imprisoned based merely upon being charged with a crime, a charge which requires only probable cause. Probable cause is the most easily met standard in criminal law. It can be met by a mere accusation from a person of dubious credibility and motive. Yet, under this bill a person could be jailed based on just such a minimal showing. The most outrageous consequence of this lessened standard for detention is that the poor will undoubtedly suffer disproportionately from it. It is the poorer members of society who will be least likely to be able to afford the excessive bail permissible under this provision. Our government must not allow a system of justice under which a rich person accused of a crime is free pending trial while a poor person accused of the same crime must stay behind bars merely because he lacks financial resources. The prospect of imprisonment without bail under this provision is even more ominous when one considers that the period of such incarceration is likely to be much longer than the period of incarceration for defendants who have been found to pose a threat to the community. Persons held without bail as a threat to the community are guaranteed an expedited trial calendar and must be released within i00 days if their trial has not begun D.C. Code Section 23-1322(d On the other hand, the new law would not provide for an expedited calendar. A person who is detained under the new provision and who is unable to make bail would be incarcerated until trial, however long that might be. Even if a person is ultimately acquitted of the crime for which they are accused, the government cannot return the months they took from that person by incarcerating them pending trial. Finally, studies have shown that jailed defendants are more likely to be convicted than those who remain free on bail. It is unjust for a defendant to face a higher risk of conviction based upon his lack of financial resources. Finally, I would like to further emphasize that this provision has no relation to the issue of prostitution, which the legislation before the Council proposes to address. This provision proposes sweeping changes in the law regarding pretrial detention. Such a radical change in our criminal justice system should not be taken lightly merely because it is in an unrelated piece of legislation. The Council should not allow this radical new proposal to strip the rights of the accused under the guise of preventing prostitution. Increased Penalties for Prostitution-Related Offenses Would Do Little to Curb Criminal Activity The increased fines for prostitution offenses will do little to curb prostitution. A woman convicted for her third prostitution 4 offense will face a mandatory fine of $i000. Women engaged in prostitution generally do not have this sort of money readily available. In order to pay such a hefty fine, an offender will most likely be forced to continue as a prostitute. Worse yet, prostitution may not be a lucrative enough activity to meet the expense of such a fine, and the woman, her boyfriend, her family members, or her pimp may be forced to engage in more violent criminal activity in order to raise the money. In fact, the deterrent effect of increased penalties may have the unwelcome effect of increasing the amount of more harmful criminal offenses. Under the proposed law, a third time prostitution offender must receive a fine of $i000 and will be incarcerated for between one and 180 days. By contrast, the penalty for second degree theft (that is, theft of items with value of less than $250) is a fine of up to $i000 and/or a sentence of up to 180 days, with no increase for subsequent offenses D.C. Code Section 22-3812(b Thus, under the revised law, a habitual thief may receive no fine at all, and could receive a fine no greater than $i000, while a third-time prostitution offender must receive a fine of $i000. The thief may receive no jail time, while the prostitute is required to be incarcerated. In short, a person may face a more severe punishment for prostitution than for theft. While this bill’s supporters no doubt believe that it will reduce the criminal activity associated with prostitution, it may have the opposite effect by driving people from prostitution into more violent criminal activities. 5 The Bill’s Sentencinq Provisions Raise Constitutional Concerns Their Cost to the District Outweiqhs Their Benefit The bill also calls for mandatory jail time for anyone convicted of prostitution-related offenses. It is short-sighted to believe that mandatory incarceration of these offenders will result in a reduction in crime. Incarcerating a first-time offender may expose them to other criminals during their incarceration. Also, it seems unwise for the financially strapped city government to spend money on the incarceration of those who commit a victimless crime while serious criminals serve no jail time. Additionally, even if jail time were the best solution for some prostitutes, a blanket sentencing decision cannot cover every possible situation. Sentencing decisions are best made on a case-by-case basis, and are therefore best left to the discretion of a judge, who can review each individual’s case and make a sentencing decision that is appropriate under the circumstances. Many defendants whom judges would not sentence to time in jail must now receive a sentence of at least one day. It is likely that defendants who would have previously served no time will now receive the minimum one-day sentence. Such a sentence serves no valid purpose. A one-day jail sentence is unlikely to have any deterrent effect on prostitution. However, the District must bear the cost of processing each new inmate in its jails, as well as the cost of supporting that inmate during the period of incarceration. In addition, the new inmate will occupy space in the District’s already crowded jails. The slight crime prevention benefit that twenty-four hours in jail might create is far outweighed by the costs to the District of a 6 one-day sentence. A court may, in its discretion, impose conditions upon a defendant in exchange for the suspension of that defendant’s sentence. While we support the flexibility of sentencing that this provision allows, we oppose the additional condition allowed under this bill, namely that a judge may order a defendant to stay away from the area where the offense was committed. This provision raises First Amendment concerns. A court should not suspend a sentence on the condition that a defendant forfeit her constitutional rights, in this case the right to association. Such a condition also raises more pragmatic concerns. Some prostitutes work out of their homes. If convicted for an offense committed in or near their home, these women may face a choice between incarceration and a reverse house arrest, where they are banned from theirown home. Denying these women access to their own home will remove them from an element of stability in their lives. Finally, this proposal will not affect the amount of prostitution, only its location. If, as Councilmember Evans has alleged, prostitutes are "brought into downtown Washington literally by the busload" and are "given maps, and are directed to work certain streets or blocks Memo from Evans to Council, 7/6/95 then banning certain prostitutes from certain locations will only result in a shuffling of locations as prostitutes are directed to a new street after being banned from their original location. 7 The Leqislation Invites Abuse By Police Throuqh Its Raisinq of the Fine for ,FTO The bill amends District traffic regulations by raising the fine for a pedestrian’s failure to obey a lawful order of a police officer FTO The fine, formerly $25, would be raised to between $i00 and $i000. The section amended is intended to set fines for pedestrian traffic violations such as jaywalking, hitchhiking, and crossing against a red light. The fine for other offenses in the section is generally just five dollars; the $25 fine for failure to obey is the highest fine in the section 18 DCMR 2000, 2603.1 While the higher fine is directed at prostitutes, it applies to everyone. The possibility of a $i000 fine is an invitation to police abuse of this provision. Police may target an individual whom they suspect of crime and charge him with FTO when they have insufficient evidence to convict him on another charge. If someone is engaged in prostitution-related activities, the police already have the ability to arrest and charge that person under existing law. Expanding the scope of an unrelated statute will only allow the police to harass those who may have committed no crime. Other Provisions of the, Bill Also Invite Abuse and Violate Due Process The bill includes several violations of due process. Section 2 permits the release of the "name, address, date of birth, occupation, and photograph of any person arrested for a violation of [prostitution laws] The District should not be publicizing the identity of arrestees in this way. To do so places an undeserved stigma on those who, under our system of justice, are innocent until proven guilty. This provision could be used by law enforcement officials to coerce an innocent defendant into pleading guilty in order to avoid the embarrassing publicity that could be created by releasing photos and information about the defendant to the public. The provision of the bill creating a lien on seized vehicles also violates due process. We recognize that this provision improves upon current law by providing a mechanism under which a person whose vehicle has been confiscated may reclaim the car. However, the revised law still has flaws. This provision can require a person whose vehicle is seized to pay "the costs of towing, storing, and administrative processing" of the vehicle, even if the person is acquitted of all charges. The amount of money involved here is not trivial. A vehicle might be in storage for weeks, or even months between a person’s arrest and his trial. If acquitted after a long trial, it would allow for the person to be able to reclaim his vehicle after paying a lien that could amount to several hundred dollars. In addition to having been deprived of his vehicle for several weeks for an offense he did not commit, this person must now pay the District in order to have his vehicle returned. It is unjust for a person to have to pay for the return of a vehicle that should never have been taken from him. It is even more unfair that this inequity gives a prosecutor an unfair 9 advantage in his case against a suspect. Since this proposal gives the Corporation Counsel the power to release this type of lien, a prosecutor Can induce a guilty plea on prostitution-related charges by holding out the carrot of the free return of the defendant’s .vehicle. A prosecutor could also use the stick instead of the carrot by threatening the continued impoundment of the vehicle if he considers the defendant’s behavior to be uncooperative. Conclusion This bill would do little to curb criminal activity; in fact, it could even lead to an increase in crime. In addition, it has numerous harmful provisions. The bill’s sentencing provision raises First Amendment concerns and removes sentencing discretion from judges who are most suited to make such decisions. Furthermore, the minimum sentences mandated by the legislation would be unnecessarily costly for the District. The raise in the fine for FTO offenses is an invitation for police abuse. The provision permitting the release of defendants’ photographs is a violation of the principal of innocence until proven guilty. Also, the amendment of the law regarding forfeiture of vehicles, while an improvement on current law, still raises due process concerns. Most importantly, the bill proposes vast changes in the law regarding bail and pretrial detention. I would like to once again stress the magnitude of the changes involved here. The legislation would allow nonviolent pretrial detainees to be held indefinitely if they are unable to make bail. The Council addressed this issue I0 in depth only three years ago and passed a less severe measure than the one now before it. The proposed changes are drastic and should not be approved under any circumstances. It would be even less prudent to approve them merely because they are included in an unrelated bill. Because of the unrelated provisions regarding bail reform, as well as the numerous other reasons outlined above, we urge the Council not to approve this bill. ii Attachment TESTIMONY BEFORE THE COMMITTEE ON THE JUDICIARY CHAIRPERSON WILLIAM P.

Attachment 15 "SAFE STREETS ANTI-PROSTITUTION AMENDMENT ACT OF 1995" TESTIMONY BEFORE THE COMMITTEE ON THE JUDICIARY DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA CITY COUNCIL WEDNESDAY, OCTOBER 25, 199.5 By: Marcia Rosenthall Executive Director Franklin Square Association Chairman Light-foot and distinguished members of the Committee on the Judidary, good afternoon am Marcia Rosenthail, the Executive Director of the Franklin Square Association appear before you as the official spokesperson for the organization should also note that i have been a DC resident for the past 1 years. First, let me thank you for calling this hearing on the "Safe Streets Anti-Prostitution Amendment Act of 995" and allowing us the opportunity to provide earnest support for its immediate passage. As you and many of your colleagues on the Council know, Franklin Square has long been an advocate for more aggressive enforcement and legislation against the prostitution activity that has plagued our neighborhood for so long. We began the Association with the mandate of cleaning the neighborhood of sexually oriented businesses to make way for a premier office district. Along the way, we have worked with Metropolitan Police Department, the Department of Public Works and at times, the Council to help in achieving our goals. In the last 11 years, we have developed some 8 million square feet of office space and contribute in excess of $55 million more in taxes per year than was paid in 983. We have also seen the last of the 14th Street sex shops.close. But we are still trying to convince the city’s leadership that more aggressive enforcement and legislation must exist to truly make a dent in the illegal actMty of prostitution. While prostitution is not considered a "violent crime or even a crime that takes precedence in our city of decay, it most definitely affects the quality of life of a neighborhood. Whether commercial or residential. Companies moved to Franklin Square on the promise of a clean and safe neighborhood. However, this can not be realized when there are prostitutes soliciting office tenants sometimes as early as 7 a.m. in the morning and 5 p.m. in the afternoon. Or, pimps regularly beating-up prostitutes outside of office buildings. Prostitution and the associated threat of crime effect all office tenants. The ever-present existence of pimps slowly circling a building in search f "his prostitutes" is a very real, and very scary reality. To us, it is an unacceptable occurrence on our streets. The District’s financial and crime problems are no longer a secret. Employers no longer have to be located in the District, and as we all know, many have decided to relocate for the "better 2 quality of life" offered in the suburbs. The prostitution problem can only discourage potential investments- further shrinking the city’s tax base. Now is the time for the Council to show leadership. Back in 1991, Jack Evans introduced the original "Safe Streets Forfeiture Act" at the urging of our Association. While we assisted in drafting the legislation, we were unaware that the actual enforcement of the law would prove so time-consuming and difficult for the different city agencies to enforce, in response to these concerns, we have come-up with new amendments which we believe will allow the police and the courts to make arrests and process the cases more efficiently. i would like to make dear that the legislation before you now is not nearly as aggressive as what we had originally requested. We had hoped to have stricter fines and mandatory sentencing. We have made it quite clear that the existing laws are doing little to discourage the growing business of street prostitution, it is too easy to be in the prostitution business in the District. And obviously, the prostitutes and their pimps agree because they are coming here in record numbers from Boston, New York, Philadelphia and elsewhere While iegiUmate businesses flee to the suburbs, it seems ironic that the prostitution activity is one of the biggest businesses in this town. And. of course, one that pays no taxes. Now, you have an opportunity to change this occurrence. Our local economy will soon be getting a much needed boost when the MC! Arena is completed. However do not think that the 20,000 spectators to the stadium will enjoy the hassles assodated with prostitution. Something must be done to protect the existing and planned businesses of this city. To the members of the Council that have not witnessed the magnitude of the prostitution problem, we encourage you to "spend the night with us i cannot imagine any member of this Council responding to their constituency with a vote of none-support after they have witnessed the activity on our streets, it is just bad business. And after a while, it is just plain embarrassing. Today, you will hear from members of law enforcement, the court system, corporation counsel, the business community, the residential community and the hospitality industry in short the tax base. Uke many others, we are looking to this Council to move this city in a new direction. We have earnestly done our part in getting all the agencies together that are needed to make a difference, it seems that they are in agreement on enforcement and increased penalties. We now need the Council to accept their recommendations and send a message to the residential and business communities that times are changing. The District must follow the lead of other major jurisdictions and pull together to enforce, prosecute and eliminate prostitution activity. For us, it is not only a moral issue, it’s about public safety and economics. It is what this city’s leadership should be focused on. It is our hope that each of you will endorse the proposed legislation. interests of our dty. And based on what you will hear today, constituency’s are seeking It is dearly in the best it is clearly what your We urge your immediate action by approving this bill. Thank you. At this time, 1 would like to yield to Robert Rader, a partner at Winston Strawn and a member of the Assodation’s board of directors Mr. Rader can discuss the legal aspects of the legislation, as he co-drafted the original "Safe Streets" bill. Bob Attachment 16 "Safe Streets Anti-Prostitution Amendment Act of 1995" Testimony Before The Committee On The Judiciary District of Columbia City Council October 25, 1995 By: Robert M. Rader Director Franklin Square Association Mr. Chairman and Distinguished Members of the Committee on the Judiciary, On behalf of the Franklin Square Association, I am grateful for this opportunity to support passage of the Safe Streets Anti-Prostitution Amendment Act of 1995. As many of you are aware from earlier hearings when this Council enacted the Safe Streets Forfeiture Act of 1992, prostitution and the open solicitation of prostitution have been a major concern of merchants and professionals in the Franklin Square neighborhood for some time. As citizens, taxpayers and professionals active in the Franklin Square area, we continue to endorse strict enforcement of the Safe Streets Forfeiture Act and all efforts to alleviate prostitution and prostitution-related crimes in the District. Initially, the Safe Streets Forfeiture Act proved to be an effective tool in curtailing prostitution trafficking. When first begun, the seizure of vehicles used in the solicitation of prostitution had the desired effect of discouraging others from venturing into known areas of prostitution solicitation and reducing the visibility and impact of prostitution upon everyday residential and commercial activities In monitoring enforcement of Safe Streets Forfeiture Act, however, those of us who had championed passage of this legislation became increasingly convinced that further refinement of the law is necessary to make it more effective. For this reason, we support the proposed amendments. Let me make clear, however, our strong conviction that the proposed legislation, while an important step forward, does not include each of the measures originally proposed as amendments that would maximize the fair and efficient enforcement of this law. We continue to believe, for example, that enforcement of the laws against prostitution are unnecessarily restricted by the requiring proof of a cash payment or solicitation of a cash payment. For that reason, we endorsed a provision introduced by Councilmember Evans, but narrowly rejected by the Council in earlier emergency legislation, that would have enabled the prosecution to make out a prima facie case of prostitution by proving conduct universally associated with prostitution alone. We believe that the law can reasonably define what shall constitute prima facie evidence that a person has committed an illegal act like prostitution. Under current law, a prostitute or man soliciting prostitution can avoid prosecution by simply avoiding any mention of a cash payment until such is satisfied that the other is not really a police officer, even though the sexual nature of the transaction is unmistakably clear. For example, it is common for a prostitute to ask a "John" to expose himself or fondle the prostitute to prove he is not a police officer. In our opinion, this kind of blatant sexual activity, coupled with repeated attempts to hail or stop moving traffic, should be sufficient to constitute prima facie evidence of soliciting prostitution. Our second proposal was a new provision criminalizing solicitation of sex by obstruction of traffic. The obstruction of vehicular and pedestrian traffic by prostitutes roaming the streets and sidewalks is a well known public nuisance and threat to public safety in the District. No one has the right to appropriate the sidewalks and streets of the District for this purpose. Further, we see no reason why the interference with the free flow of traffic for the purpose of sexual solicitation should require proof of a fee to alleviate this public nuisance and remove this obstruction from our streets. From the perspective of public safety, we think it is simply irrelevant whether money changes hands when drivers and pedestrians are put at risk by flagrant solicitation for sex on the District’s sidewalks and streets. I might add that we were surprised to learn that some regarded this straightforward provision as a potential means for the police to abuse civil liberties. I would respectfully point out that when this Council first deliberated the Safe Street Forfeiture Act, some critics similarly suggested that civil liberties would be eroded. Yet, since the Act’s passage, there has never been evena single allegation that the police have abused their authority under this statute. 4 There has not been a single instance in which the courts of the District of Columbia have ordered the return of any vehicle seized under authority of the Safe Streets Forfeiture Act. I have not heard reported a single instance in which anyone has alleged that a police officer has exceeded his or her authority in seizing or forfeiting any vehicle. And finally, no individual has successfully challenged any provision of the Safe Streets Forfeiture Act as violating any fight of due process, freedom of expression or any other right guaranteed by the Constitution or by statute. Yet, the mere suggestion of possible police excesses under the legislation previously proposed by Councilmember Evans, was sufficient to achieve its defeat by a single vote. So while we endorse the current proposal, we respectfully submit to the Council that it should reconsider the more significant and more effective measures it narrowly rejected only a few months ago. 5 Some of the measures originally proposed by Councilmember Evans and strongly endorsed by the Franklin Square Association are included in the present bill. In particular, we support the creation of a lien in favor of the District of Columbia in an amount equal to the cost of towing and storing vehicles seized under the Safe Streets Forfeiture Act. This lien provision ensures that, where the District elects to show leniency by returning a seized vehicle to a first-time offender, even though a violation of law has occurred, the District will recoup its out-of-pocket expenses in seizing and storing the vehicle. Also, the imposition or threat of such a lien will deter acts of solicitation in the District. Finally, the imposition of the lien gives the District a mechanism for returning the vehicles to first-time offenders, thus avoiding the serious backlog of stored vehicles that has impaired enforcement of the law. The Franklin Square Association also supports and endorses the increased fines and terms of imprisonment provided by this bill. In our view, these increased penalties afford flexibility to prosecutors and the Courts and are warranted in the face of growing recidivism in the trafficking of prostitution. We also support and endorse the availability of"stay away"orders as an additional tool that should be made available to law enforcement officers and the courts. I cannot personally endorse, however, the provision of this bill. permitting the Metropolitan Police Department to cooperate with private citizens in the release of the names of individuals arrested for prostitution or soliciting prostitution. In my view, this is an invitation to public vilification and is inconsistent with the rights of an accused under our system of criminal justice. Whatever private citizens might choose to do on their own, I believe it is unseemly for the District of Columbia government to facilitate and cooperate with efforts whose avowed purpose is public humiliation of an accused. Again, we thank you for this opportunity to share our views and concerns on this important legislation and to urge its prompt passage. 7 Attachment 17 "Safe Streets Forfeiture Amendment Act of 1995" Testimony Before the Committee on the Judiciary District of Columbia City Council Wednesday, October 25, 1995 By: Philip A. Doyle General Manager Days Inn Downtown Chairman Lightfoot, distinguished members of the Judiciary Committee, good afternoon. My name is Philip Doyle, and I am employed by Potomac Hotel Group, and The Stephen A. Goldberg Company, as General Manager of the Days Inn Downtown at 1201 K Street, NW. I represent the interests of Conrad Cafritz and Stephen A. Goldberg, two prominent citizens of the District as well as leasees of our office building and employees of the hotel would like to thank Council Member Lighffoot for calling this headng on the Safe Streets Anti-Prostitution Amendment Act of 1995. I appreciate the invitation to appear before you and submit testimony that would encourage you to support passage of legislation that effectively addresses our concerns. Potomac Hotel Group was selected by Mr. Stephen Goldberg to manage the Days Inn and took possession of the property on June 24, 1994. We were retained to revitalize and reposition this hotel, to make it a viable competitor in the market place. and a profitable entity inthe owner’s portfolio. Although we have made great strides toward this goal, outperforming competitors in a tough market, we are plagued at every turn by this ongoing problem: We are able to obtain the business but are having difficulty in retaining it for future years. This problem in no way has undermined our resolve. If anything, it has reinforced our commitment. You may ask VVhy this synopsis of our accomplishments This tells you about my accountability to all concerned parties and my sense of obligation. I am responsible to my owners, clients, tenants, community and employees. I take this commitment very seriously and owe much of our success this year to my ability to instill the notion in my staff that we must all be accountable for our words and deeds as they affect all of us. It is my duty to react to the prostitution problem that affects the city. The streets immediately outside the hotel became an all night sideshow 7 days a week. This began in early March of this year. I reacted by hiring additional off-duty security to patrol the sidewalks adjacent to the hotel at a cost of $12,000 per month. I contacted members of the Franklin Square, community associations, the school board, local churches, union hall and Council Member Jack Evans with their support we formed a community action committee. I was proactive in letting my clients know there was a serious problem around our hotel. Initially, they were secure in the fact.that I could resolve the problem. However, they, as well as I, recognize that this problem is greater and too far reaching, to solve on our own, I can make a hotel perform under the most difficult circumstances, but I can not control the streets around the hotel. This is why I am here today. It is my perception that some of the Council Members feel that this is a 3 downtown problem, unique to the business district. I disagree with this thought, and as you will hear from the people that will follow my testimony, this problem touches all of our lives in some way. This blight on our community has become so far reaching that it is a quality of life issue. I find it hard to believe that it is easier to pass tough legislation on dumping trash in vacant lots in the city. The fine is up to $500 and impoundment of the vehicle. The law was touted as an effective deterrent dudng the city-wide clean up day on October 21 st. performing sex acts on our city streets. with. I see no difference between dumping and They both leave refuse that we all must deal I have a video tape that depicts a typical scenario of the night life that exists on our streets. We have a foundation that uses our hotel 14 weeks of the year producing revenues just under a million dollars for our hotel. They conduct programs that bring in senior citizens, new American citizens and high school students to visit this city to see their government at work. This is an intense six day program with the goal of making them better informed and responsible citizens. While they were housed in our hotel ’ their participants were approached by hookers, in various states of semi-nudity, to take pictures with them to send home as mementos of their visit to the Nation’s Capital. They only asked $5.00 for this privilege. I ask you, can you imagine the parents outrage when their child comes home with these pictures What kind of organization 4 goes into such a neighborhood and houses students where prostitution is a nightly activity Our Director of Sales called a contact that housed a Secret Service contingent, a "past client" in our hotel during Arafat’s visit. They told her "we really enjoyed our stay, the renovation looks great, the service was outstanding and we really liked the show Show Was her response Yes, the show that went on every night outside my window Do you honestly think that they will rebook our hotel? I think not. What about a member of the Future Farmers of America that is granted a summer scholarship to study in the Nation’s Capital for a week? They come from small towns across this great nation. They come to learn how to be better citizens and effective business managers so that when they return to their community they can help make an effective change. Some have never been to a large city, rode a plane or even an elevator. Only to return home to tell stories about hookers swarming the streets of the Nation’s Capital. This organization normally used northern Virginia locations to house their groups as they believed that area was safer. They felt it would be good to try the District as it was the seat of the government. We did not try to hide the prostitution problem, we tried to deal with it providing 24-hour security and planned arrival and departure activities around the hookers’ business hours. We will not see this business which means a loss of $300,000 in summer business for our hotel. How would you like to work in a place where you are late to work because the traffic was rerouted and you had to back track to get to work. Maybe I am wrong in disagreeing with your perception that this is a business related problem. You were right in your original assumptions. It is a business problem. A very profitable business has been set up in our city. These prostitutes are not crack whores or the transvestites that roamed our streets in years past. These are an effective army of professional adults and minors that are muscled out on our streets to ply their trade. These ladies are well directed by pimps from New York, Florida, New Orleans and Texas. These girls are dropped off in vans and cars on our street corners supplied with area maps leading them to the prime spots to conduct their business. We are supplying Detective Haggard with license tags to effect some sort of change. He can only do what the law empowers him. You must make the change. I hope you found the video informative It highlights various forms of activity that occur on our streets. The video was supplied by a student, Keith Olwell, of American University. He is doing an anthropology study about prostitution in Washington, D.C. He was given my name by a member of the Hotel Association that shares our problem. In our initial conversation, I asked him why D.C? He stated that the reason was well known around the country: It is easier to conduct prostitution in this city, even easier than in Nevada. The laws on our books have not been addressed since 1901. Other areas around the country know our laws need to be revamped. They know that there is little cause to worry. That is why they come here to set up shop. 6 There is a biblical phrase that would apply to some of the attitudes that exist with regard to this problem He who is without sin cast the first stone How does this apply? Quite simply. This problem exists in all wards in the city, whether it a professional hooker or a crack whore. To believe that it does not exist In your ward is to deceive yourself. There are employees of my hotel that will testify that it does exist in their neighborhoods, wards 3, 4 and 8. It exists in the alleys, side streets, on the school playground, and the church steps. This problem weighs heavy on all of us. It effects the city tourism and incurs additional governmental expenses (Strong John Thompson School was forced into putting up an 8 ft. chain link fence to prevent the whores, pimps and Johns from performing sex acts in the school yard This alone cost the city and businesses tax dollars that could be put to better use. Our streets are blocked off with cones and flares to impede the traffic flow. We are prisoners in our city. Isn’t this a good impression on visitors from other communities and countries? This isn’t Council Member Evans or Ward 2 problem. This is a city problem. We are loosing our tax base to the suburbs or other cities without this problem. Some people know what a viable business prostitution can be, They are afraid that the pimps will take retribution on those who interfere. We cannot, and will not, hide in fear. Harry Truman was fond of saying "Bring the battle to them, don’t wait for someone to bring the battle to us That is what we are doing today, bringing you the battle. I look to all of you on the City Council, what would you have me say to clients that ask are you in a safe area? What would you reply to a major tour operator in a meeting in New York, that knows about the prostitution, when they pose the question "1 understand there is a serious prostitution problem in your city, what you are doing about it Fortunately, for now, they trust us and believe that we will be able to effectively deal with this problem. Ladies and gentlemen, time and faith are running out for us both! I ask that as you listen to the testimony that follows, please listen with a clear mind and an open heart. Let our various voices become one, showing you that as a group, the police, courts, businesses, churches, unions and citizens, we all sing from the same sheet of music. We are united in solving this problem. We need you to provide us with the score, the tools to deal with this issue enact effective legislation Add additional strength to this legislation, change the Failure to Obey to Loitering for Prostitution. The courts and defense attorneys view implementation of the FTO statute as an over-used and abused citation by the police. They tend to be more lenient. The Days Inn and Potomac Hotel Group both contribute valuable tax revenue to the city and employ hundreds of people. At the Days Inn we contribute 326,000 in real estate taxes, 30,000 in personal property, 540,000 in sales and use tax, and employ over 60 people. 8 Potomac Hotel Group provides 880,324 in real estate taxes, 147,346 in personal property taxes, 137,000 in vault taxes, 32,000 in franchise taxes and employ a total of 400 employees. As a vital instrument of tax payment and employment, we ask that you give the utmost consideration to what should be a deterrent and NOT a free ride. As we are united, so must all of you. Support this bill. Hear our voice, not one alone, but a united group with a purpose. Give us an answer. Pass effective legislation. Thank you. 9 Attachment 18 "Safe Streets Forfeiture Amendment Act of 1995" Testimony Before the Committee on the Judiciary District of Columbia City Council Wednesday, October 25, 1995 By Irene Williams Days Inn Downtown Members of the Judiciary Committee, Chairman Lightfoot. Thank you for allowing me to appear before you today. My name is Irene Williams and I live at 453 Valley Avenue, S.E in Ward 8 of this city. When I walk down the street to catch the bus I see crackheads hussling near the school daily. The kids can see the exchange of drugs and money right in front of them. This is terrible that we cannot raise our children in a city free from drugs and whores. I want you to know that there are prostitutes that live in my neighborhood. Prostitution is all over e city from my home to where I work. Won’t you please put a stop to this! Pass effective laws. Free us from this problem. Attachment 19 "Safe Streets Forfeiture Amendment Act of 1995" Testimony Before the Committee on the Judiciary District of Columbia City Council Wednesday, October 25, 1995 By Dollie Tann Days Inn Downtown ¯ Council Member Lighffoot, members of the Council, good afternoon. My name is Dollie Tann and I live at 368022nd Street, S.E in Ward 8. I come here today to complain about crock dealers dealing on the streets of my neighborhood. This activity attracts whores as they will do anything for money This involves the teenagers in the neighborhood as well. I have seen a man killed right in front of my house on the other side of the street because he was stalking a girl. He was stabbed 17 times with a butcher knife. I am afraid for my grandchildren and my safety as there is constant gun fire because the whores and dealers are fighting over territory. Clean this up. We did not have this problem before. We have security patrol this area but they are always late. I cannot live this way. Good afternoon Chairman Lighffoot and members of the Judiciary Committee. My name is Emestine Baker and I reside at 4910 Kansas Avenue, N.W in Ward 4 of this city. I work at the Days inn Downtown at 12th &amp;amp; K Streets, N.W. Every morning as come to work I see hookers on the streets, in almost no clothes. I find this a disgrace and offensive. By coming here today, we hope that we can put a stop to prostitution. I need to work and it is going to drive our business away.

Thank you for allowing me to give testimony here today. My name is Mary Boyde. I live at 449 Valley Avenue, S.E in Ward 8. When my co-workers an-d I enter through the back of the hotel we must walk over used condoms after the prostitutes have used the loading dock and back alley as a room. Sometimes you will find the prostitutes in the back alley or across the street at the car rental agecy. These activities take place near the playground in view of the children. Not only is this going on downtown, but also in my neighborhood. Where live, whores are servicing delivery truck ddvers nearmy buss stop. This is early in the morning as I come to work am frightened by this activity. Do something about it! Moving it from area to area is not helping. work and clear my street.

Kramer President, Logan Circle Community Association October 25, 1995 Before the Committee on the Judiciary Good afternoon, Chairman Lightfoot and members of the Committee. My name is Helen Kramer, and I am the president of the Logan Circle Community Association, whose 300-odd members include both residents and area businesses, all of whom are fed up with prostitution in our neighborhood. ¯ LCCA activists have taken time offfrom work to appear before you today to urge,you to support a different approach to the problem of prostitution, one designed to work’within the budgetary constraints placed on city agencies and the police in 1995. Logan Circle residents have been struggling against prostitution in our neighborhood since the 1970s. During the 1980s, we worked closely with the poiice to set up a system of elaborate roadblocks around the Circle itself, in an effort to drive the streetwalkers away. I’m happy to report to you that today, on some streets north and west of the Circle, a prostitute is a rare sight. Unfortunately for those of us ,living south and east of the Circle, dealing with prostitution is a way of life. Within a 10 block area bordered by Massachusetts Avenue on the south and Rhode Island Avenue on the north, from 13th Street on the west, and 7th Street on the east, you can observe: 2 ¯ Women selling themselves to men ¯ Transvestite men selling themselves to men ¯ ¯ Men dressed as men selling themselves to other men ¯ Andsaddest and least known of all, adult pimps~selling children You can find prostitutes all dressed up in satin and lace, wearing five-inch spike heels. You can find crack addicts who have not bathed in days looking to make. money for their next hit. You can find prostitutes cruising the neighborhood in their cars, sporting Maryland and Virginia ~ags, and .soliciting johns at stop lights. You can find them in their young teens, or some older women that by their late 20s look aged well beyond their years. They are mostly white, but also black and Hispanic. And worst of all, they are open for business 24 hours a day, 7 days a week, 365 days of the year. Prostitution is not a-victimless crime. This is what it does to our neighborhood. It gets noisy. It gets dirty. Used condums are discarded on the streets, in the grass and in the alleys. Prostitutes use our stairwells and green spaces as toilets Johns pee in our drivewaysl alleys and gardens. It becomes a much less desirable place to live. It’s a bad environment for children. It’s definitely the worst in mild weather, when people try to sleep with their windows open. Large conventions have a tendency to attract prostitutes, who arrive from other east Coast cities to. do business here. The District of Columbia has a national reputation for lax anti-prostitution laws. When other cities crack down, the prostitutes come here. This summer was particularly gruesome. We experienced an unusually large influxof prostitutes who arrived by vanloads from New York and ,New Jersey, and who were directed into our neighborhood by pimps with street maps. After my testimony today, the next community, speaker, Eric Korpon, is going to narrate for you a video tape that he made about prostitution in our neighborhood. It will give you a real feel for the kind of disruption that takes place night after night on the residential streets of Logan Circle: Of course, all of this activity has a measurable effect on the property values-of homes in our neighborhood; the willingness of small business people to invest in the revitalization of the 14th Street commercial corridor and the city’s tax base. Prostitution is robbing the city of precious tax dollars. You can’t afford to allow it to continue, and neither can we~ The Logan Circle Community Association has a long and positive history of working with the Third District of the Metropolitan Police Department on this issue. We deeply appreciate how hard they are working to help us with limited resources. However, we must tell you that the tools they have to combat the prostitution problem are not sufficient. To make a prostitution arrest, the police department must organize a labor- intensive "sting" operation. If the "sting" is targeted to arresting the prostitutes, undercover policemen pose as johns. If the "sting" is targeted to arresting johns and seizing cars, undercover policewomen loiter on street corners. In either Case, these operations occupy a tremendous amount of police resources. Between 6 to 10 officers are needed to run a sting, and the undercover.officers must be wired. With the police budget and staffing levels approaching new historical lows, there is no way that regular sting operations can be staged. There isn’t enough money and there aren’t enough people: Instead, what the police do is arrest prostitutes on a "Failure to Obey" charge, 4 which calls for a $50 maximum fine for failing to obey an officer, s orders to get out of the street. This "FTO" charge takes the prostitutes off the streets for about three hours. Most of them forfeit the fine in lieu of appearing in court to challenge the charge. In fact, the police have told us that most of the streetwalkers carry the $50 fine with them each night--it’s considered a cost of doing business. Mr. Chairman, with tools this few and fines this low, the economics of prostitution is working against .the city of Washington, against the police department, and against city residents. A prostitute can earn between $250 and $1,000 a night. Unless our enforcement mechanisms hit them in the pocketbook, we have no chance to win this battle. We must make Washington a less desirable place to engage in prostitution. We believe that the bill introduced by Jack Evans does that. It increases the minimum FTO fine to $100. It also allows even stiffer fines to be charged to repeat offenders, up to a maximum of $1,000. This one toot, more than any other in the legislative package before you, will be of maximum benefit to our thinly~staffed police force: The bill benefits the war on prostitution in other ways, too. It seeks improvements in the law concerning seizure of johns’ cars,.so that vehicles can be processed more quickly and the city receive fines more quickly. It increases the fines for prostitution, and compels a night in jail for those found guilty of prostitution. It allows the courts to impose "stay away"orders that would keep prostitutes out of a particular neighborhood. And it allows residents access to police.photos of those arrested for proStitution-related offenses, so that the community can play a role in enforcing stay-away orders. These changes are all positive improvements tO the District’s ability to return .5 neighborhoods to law-abiding residents. There will be no drastic increase in our jail populations. Indeed, ttie whole point is to encourage prostitutes and pimps to leave town. No expensive or time-consuming processes are added to our police or judicial enforcement system. There are no hidden "costs?’ of voting for this bill. The residents of Logan Circle urge you to vote in favor of this bill in its entirety. If not for us, then for residents throughout the District who are facing the same problems that we are. Attachment 24 Good afternoon, Chairman Lightfoot and other distinguished members of the Judiciary Committee. I am Laura A. Shell. I live at 1221 Massachusetts Avenue, NW. I have lived at this address for twenty- three years. I am the Field Coordinator for the Old City Coalition Citizens Patrol, an orange hat group in downtown Washington, and I am Metro Orange Coalition’s Coordinator for all the orange hat groups in the Third District. I am also Vice Chairman of the Third District’s citizens Advisory Council. In September of 1991, the citizens in downtown Washington, DC came together to form an orange hat group called Old City Coalition Citizens Patrol. Citizens from Logan Circle Community Association, Blagden Alley Association, Wisteria Mansion Condominium Association, Cambridge Tenants Association, Massachusetts House Tenants Association and O Street Association united because prostitution in the downtown area was ruining our quality of life. An alliance was formed with the Third District of the Metropolitan Police Department and together we vowed to fight prostitution in our neighborhood. So, on Fridays and Saturdays, we walk our streets until midnight and normally later trying to rid our neighborhood of prostitutes, male and female. There are people who do not understand the value of a citizens patrol. Also, victimless crime. there are those who believe prostitution is a We who live in downtown Washington are victims. We are victims of ~erious traffic jams, vehicular noise, street altercations, screaming, yelling, etc. Often crowds of men (old and young, rich and poor) gather to observe the women walking up and down our sidewalks and in our streets trying to attract customers at all hours of the day and night, particularly at night. Prostitution plays havoc with our peace and quiet at night. Our patrol is our way of peaceably moving the criminal element out of our neighborhood. And, that is all we can do. We move it. And, it comes back. When we are on patrol, we encounter prostitutes who have no fear of being arrested. They will tell us and the police officer with us that they have fifty dollars, so arrest them. Often, when they are released after being arrested on the fifty dollar Failure to Obey, they immediately go back to the street to work. Many are arrested that night. When we are on patrol on Saturdays, like this Saturday, October 21, we encountered prostitutes who had been arrested on Friday, October 20. The fifty dollar charge for Failure To Obey is no deterrent to prostitution. Repeated fifty dollar arrests are no deterrent to prostitution. Residents from the Logan Circle and Bladgen Alley communities collected donations and purchased orange traffic cones. With the assistance of the Third District, these cones were used in an J tempt to break the traffic flow on those streets that prostitutes 0~/normally~ work at night. The cones were reasonably effective in breaking the. traffic flow. It brought a quiet we ~ad not experienced In a long, long time. Then, our cones slowly but surely were destroyed and stolen by the prostitutes and pimps. Our patrolling of the neighborhood continues. We have no real weapons in this war. We often find ourselves hoping there is a traffic charge or a parking ticket that can be issued on the cars of the prostitutes and pimps. Sometimes, the police are actually able to impound some of these cars. We have had some of our patrollers stop patrolling because they felt that what we do is short term and all in vain. We have had some of our patrollers move out of the area because after real personal involvement in trying to improve the quality of life and failing, their frustration and despair forced them to leave. But, those of us who are left, and there are quite a few of us, keep trying. Our police officers keep trying. We are tired and frustrated but we must continue fighting as best we can. In September, 1991, citizens in downtown Washington joined with our police department to fight prostitution. It is now October, 1995, and we are still fighting as hard as ever. We cannot succeed without your help. We have to have legislation that makes prostitution a costly means of making a living in Washington, DC. Without the "Safe Streets Anti-ProstitutionAmendment Act of 1995 we cannot make a real difference in our war against prostitution. Please help the Metropolitan Police Department and the citizens of the District of Columbia by voting in favor of this bill. Attachment 25 Bill 11-439 The Safe Streets Anti-Prostitution Amendment Act of 1995" Testimony of Leslie Miles President, Blagden Alley Community Association October 25, 1995 Good afternoon, Mr. Chairman and members of the Committee. My name is Leslie Miles, and I am president of the Blagden Alley Community Association. Our association represents residents and businesses within the area bordered by Seventh Street, Thirteenth Street, H Street and Q Street, Northwest. Our neighborhood is at the core of our city including the K Street Corridor, the Convention Center, the new arena and the proposed convention center site. We appreciate the opportunity to address you on this important subject. Our small corner of the city has the misfortune of being plagued by prostitution, with a peculiar specialty, transvestite prostitution. Transvestite prostitutes congregate in Gompers Park at 10th and Massachusetts Avenue, making the park unavailable to other patrons, and daily walk the residential streets of our neighborhood. While it is true they have been with us a long time, we feel that the time has certainly come to make the streets safe for the rest of us. These larger-thanTlife "women" are not harmless eccentrics out of "La Cage Aux Folles."They are big strong men who carry weapons and use serious drugs. They are not invisible nocturnal creatures they work round the clock. And they are full-time, long-term professionals with established routes, beats and clienteles, composed mainly of customers from the suburbs. This is their life, 24 hours a day, and it’s destroying the life of our community. Other witnesses have discussed different aspects of prostitution and how this "victimless crime" affects legitimate residents of our community. In my testimony, I want to focus, from a women’s perspective, on some very real, and very negative, quality of life issues that arise when communities are asked to coexist with prostitution. Imagine for a moment what it might be like to be a woman, walking home alone to your Blagden Alley home after working all day in your downtown office. You are dressed in your business suit and overcoat, carrying a briefcase, and trying to enjoy one of the best features of downtown iiving- the ability to commute on foot. As you walk down the sidewalk, a car pulls up beside you. Inside it are perhaps one, or two, or three men. They roll down the window and ask you "Hey, Baby. How much Is this a joke? Are they serious? Do you run? Will they follow? Do you answer? How do you answe~ Should you get mad? If you get mad, will they harm you? It doesn’t matter that you don’t "look like" a hooker. Every woman walking our Folles."They are big strong men who carry weapons and use sedous drugs. They are not invisible nocturnal creatures- they work round the clock. And they are fiJII-time, long-term professionals with established routes, beats and clienteles, composed mainly of customers from the suburbs. This is their life, 24 hours a day, and it’s destroying the life of our community.

Do you run? Will they follow Do you answer How do you answer? Should you get mad? If you get mad, will they harm you? It doesn’t matter that you don’t "look like" a hooker. Every woman walking our neighborhood streets is assumed to be at work. This scene is played almost daily in my neighborhood. It has happened to me a dozen times, dressed as you see me today. It has happened to my neighbors. At neighborhood events and social occasions, it is commonplace to exchange stories about our latest "encounters" with these confused johns. And you should know that these encounters can be very frightening. These johns can be drunk. They can be using drugs. If the car is full of men shopping for sex, they may not be concerned that you are not selling sex. The encounter can be even worse if a language barrier is involved. Let me tell you about some other kinds of encounters we have. Some of my neighbors have families, and are attempting to raise children in this environment. Not too long ago, a new mother decided to walk one block to the store to buy a newspaper. It’s 8 o’clock in the morning, and off she goes with the new baby in her arms, heading for the store. Coming down the sidewalk are a couple of transvestite prostitutes, decked out in their dresses and heels. Spying the room and her baby, they start making cooing noises and lean over asking morn if they can take a look at the little baby. That young mom and her husband are closing on a home in suburban Maryland this week, and our neighborhood is losing a committed, activist member. And what about the parents of slightly older children, children who are old enough to wonder why that strange-looking woman with large feet and legs like a man’s is dressed in a micro-mini-skirt? Often these men expose their genitals on the street and sidewalk. How do you explain this to kids? Unfortunately, the answer most often is that you don’t. You move. And, if you can’t move, you never, ever let your kids outside to be exposed to prostitution. When I am out walking and have to pass the transvestites, which happens almost every day, I face this dilemma- do I talk to them and make them feel unwelcome? Do I tell them that they kept me up all night? They don’t hesitate to speak to me and make me feel unwelcome. They talk trash, bum cigarettes. As my husband and I contemplate raising a family downtown we wonder, how do we do this? Do I want my daughter harassed by johns, jostled by hookers? Let me direct your attention to another problem noise. It’s difficult to capture on videotape the volume of noise that prostitution brings. The first thing to understand about why noise is such an issue is to understand that people who become prostitutes are not highly skilled in resolving conflict or problems in their life. When anything goes wrong, they begin to yell. Screaming profanity somehow gives the disenfranchised a sense of power. And once they begin to scream, no one can sleep. They could be set off by a john who dumped them without paying, or by a rival prostitute who set up shop on the block uninvited. They could be mad because someone owes them money and hasn’t paid them back. Any little thing produces a enough to wonder why that strange-looking woman with large feet and legs like a man’s is dressed in a micro-mini-skirt? Often these men expose their genitals on the street and sidewalk. How do you explain this to kids? Unfortunately, the answer most often is that you don’t. You move. And, if you can’t move, you never, ever let your kids outside to be exposed to prostitution. When I am out walking and have to pass the transvestites, which happens almost every day, I face this dilemma- do I talk to them and make them feel unwelcome? Do I tell them that they kept me up all night? They don’t hesitate to speak to me and make me feel unwelcome. They talk trash, bum cigarettes. As my husband and I contemplate raising a family downtown we wonder, how do we do this? Do I want my daughter harassed by johns, jostled by hookers? ¯ Let me direct your attention to another problem noise. It’s difficult to capture on videotape the volume of noise that prostitution brings. The first thing to understand about why noise is such an issue is to understand that people who become prOstitutes are not highly skilled in resolving conflict or problems in their life. When anything goes wrong, they begin to yell. Screaming profanity somehow gives the disenfranchised a sense of power. And once they begin to scream no one can sleep. They could be set off by a john who dumped them without paying, or by a rival prostitute who set up shop on the block uninvited. They could be mad because someone owes them money and hasn’t paid them back. Any little thing produces a torrent of vulgarity that would make a Teamster blush. And, it goes on all night. I live in the middle of a residential block of houses and small apartment buildings, but my street is a thoroughfare and communication link for streetwalkers. Sometimes the screaming is right under my bedroom window. Often one screamer is on M Street, the other on N and my street, Tenth, is the telephone line. Or the combatants walk down the street screeching. One 0 Street resident reported waking up at 2 a.m. this summer to a screaming contest that degenerated into a fistfight when two female prostitutes began squabbling over a john. Again, these are not a bunch of ladies out of a romance novel. They are dangerous. The children and families of this city deserve better. Residents and businesses in Blagden Alley call Upon you to vote in favor of the Safe Streets Act. The Blagden Alley Neighborhood Association has worked closely with the police department to combat prostitution in our neighborhood, we know and appreciate our Inspector, Captain and officers, and we respect their efforts. But we have come to the conclusion that existing laws are not enough. We must give the police broader authority to tackle prostitution, and to stiffen the penalties associated with this crime. The police desperately need to be able to apply increased fines associated with the "Failure To Obey" charge. The existing fine, a $50 maximum, is insufficient. Failure to Obey is a quick, resource-efficient way to turn the economics of prostitution on its head. By driving up the cost of doing business, and doing so in a way that does not require increased police resources, you can make a real difference in the quantity of prostitutes that will be roaming my neighborhood. They will move to a jurisdiction that where the costs of doing business are less. We also need to be able to allow the courts to impose "stay away" orders, particularly for repeat offenders. For that reason, the bill before you contains a provision authorizing stay away orders in prostitution cases, and calls upon the police department to make the photos of those arrested available to the public for a reasonable fee. You probably heard about our neighborhood’s program to publicize prostitutes and their customers by posting their activities on the Internet. We even hung a banner on a building at the corner of 10th and M Streets to announce our plan to the intended targets, in the hope that publicity would scare them away. Our efforts won Blagden Alley international media attention, but in the end, did little to stem our problem. Because collecting the names of those arrested as johns and hookers is not very effective unfortunately, police make very few arrests for prostitution. Making that charge stick requires resource-intensive undercover operations that this city can no longer afford. That’s why FTOs, stay-away orders, minimum fines and sentences that will serve as a real deterrent and publicity for offenders are all so important: if this law increased fines associated with the =Failure To Obey" charge. The existing fine, a $50 maximum, is insufficient. Failure to Obey is a quick, resource-efficient way to turn the economics of prostitution on its head.

The increase in minimum fines and sentences to a night in jail will make a tremendous difference. Those convicted Of prostitution will face some real penalty, raising the cost of doing business so that we are not the attractant to crime we are today. The bill also streamlines the city’s ability to process cars seized from johns so we can enforce current law. These important changes ensure that when the police do run an undercover operation, the penalties that the accused will face are real. Councilman Evans has worked closely with our community and all its members to assess the problem and craft this flexible, creative, workable solution. We thank him for his efforts, and call on you to make those good intentions a reality for our neighborhood, our safety and our city. We urge you to pass the Safe Streets Anti- Prostitution Amendment Act, and thank you for your considerationl Leslie Miles Blagden Alley Community Association 1244 Tenth Street, N.W. Washington, D.C. 20001 202-408-1622 Attachment 26 Testimony of Melvin F. Brown President, O Street Community Association October 25, 1995 Bill 11-439 The Safe Streets Anti-Prostitution Amendment Act of 1995" Good afternoon, Mr. Chairman and members of the Judiciary Committee. My name is Melvin F. Brown and I am a seven-year resident of the 1400 block of 10th Street NW. In addition to being president of the O Street Association, I and my wife are members of both the Logan Circle and the Blagden Alley Community Associations. I am also active in committee work for the local Advisory Neighborhood Commission. My wife and I are consummate urbanites. We decided that we would like to settle in an urban neighborhood, where we were close to city amenities like theaters, museums, shopping and restaurants, and where our neighbors would be as diverse as the architectural styles of the buildings we live in. We found a house on 10th Street that was sorely in need of renovation, and for the past six years we’ve been putting it together so that it is now ready to be lived in. While the physical improvements to our house are tangible expressions of our optimism for urban life, the physical conditions in the surrounding neighborhood is wanting in many respects. Our neighborhood is plagued with alcoholism, drug abuse, prostitution and the crimes related to these social problems. Today, I want to focus on just one of these problems prostitution. Prostitution is not a victimless crime. Prostitution takes a toll on our community and its people. We desperately need your help in bringing this threat to our neighborhood under control by passing laws that will allow the police to effectively deal with their part of the solution to the problems that prostitution creates. Let me give you a few examples of how bad the situation is. For those of you who don’t experience the effects of prostitution on a daily basis, like I do, it can be hard to understand how difficult it is to cope. One Sunday morning, I came out the front door of my house to run an errand. Parked directly in front of my home was a car containing two people a john being serviced by a hooker. This activity occurred in bright sunshine in full view of anyone passing by. What if my kids and grandchildren had been coming to visit that morning? What if my neighbor had been taking her kids to church? This is not a scene that I want to see from my front steps, and it is certainly not what I want my grandchildren or any children to see. Another weekend day, my wife and I were in the backyard doing some gardening. When we drove into the alley next to my house to unload some supplies, we found another john and another prostitute parked in the alley about 15 feet from where we were working, engaging in sex. The prostitutes use our alley not only for sex but also as bathrooms and as areas to settle their frequent squabbles. Another time, my wife and I were out in front of our house and saw a john stop his car and talks to a known prostitute. My wife circled the car to signal to the john that we knew what was going on and to get into position to see and write down the license plate of his car to report it to the police. The john saw her, and threatened us using obscenity before driving off. These are the kinds of experiences that we put up with almost daily. Streetwalkers use my block and the alleys around our home to service their customers. We find used condoms, surgical gloves, candles and other paraphernalia used by prostitutes all the time. They defecate and urinate in our alleys. These same prostitutes also buy dmg~ from dealers on llth and 12th Streets, further contributing to the decline of our neighborhood. I have personally witnessed this, and have observed many prostitutes who can barely walk because they are so high on crack cocaine or heroine. I have been at the receiving end of harangues by prostitutes, who don’t like the fact that I encourage them to go elsewhere. I have picked up the trash they leave on my block beer bottles, fortified wine, sodas, food containers, condoms. Mr. Chairman, you have seen Mr. Korpon’s film. It was shot on the Southwest comer of 12th Street and O, NW. What you saw was only the nighttime activity. Until Inspector Proctor of the Third District began to give us serious police support, the southwest comer of 1 lth and O Street NW was a haven for daytime solicitation and a rest stop for prostitutes. This is no way to live. The Council must support the community’s effort to make a decent and safe place to live. The police need your help, by having tougher legislation. Tougher penalties on prostitution, and a change in the ’Tailure to obey" law are necessary to start to assist the police in attacking the problems caused by prostitution. Simply increasing the fines for prostitution is not enough. The police are too short-handed to operate on a frequent enough basis the elaborate undercover operations needed to arrest prostitutes or johns for sexual solicitation. That is why we are asking you to also raise the fines for ’Tailure To Obey Today failure to obey" is used to charge prostitutes with unlawfully walking in the street against a police officer’s direct order. By raising the fine to a $100 minimum, you have an opportunity to make prostitution uneconomic in our neighborhood and our city. Prostitutes (and there are many) who can, will move to another jurisdiction. Tougher prostitution laws would also make Washington less attractive to out-of-town prostitutes who come to Washington to do business. Over the past two years, my wife and I have been very involved in other community clean-ups, zoning issues, ABC issues, and matters related to the downtown arena and new Convention Center. We’ve spent hours with rakes and brooms cleaning up trash and weeds in our neighborhood and throughout the Logan Circle area. But we can’t stop the problems associated with prostitution with a rake and a broom. We need laws that will make prostitution too expensive to survive in Washington. We need you to vote for this bill. Thank you.

Washington, D.C. 20004 Wednesday, October 25, 1995 Public hearing on Bill 11-439, the "Safe S~reets,,Anti-Prostitution Amendment,Act of 1995 Dear Mr. Chairman and. members of the Committee, My name is Robert Ryan Riddle, and I am Advisory Neighborhood Commissioner for 2F05. I have served as Commissioner for the past two years. The single member district I represent in Northwest D.C. is bordered by 0 Street on the north, H Street on the south, ]3th Streeton the west and ]Oth Street on the east. In my estimation it is the area hardest-hit by this season’s unprecedented wave of prostitution in our c~ty. I have received numerous complaints from constituents along 10th, 1]th, and 13th Streets, and along Massachusetts Avenue, since the wave began in early spring. Our neighborhoods have been inundated by women in G-strings and little else. While that may seem a victimless crime to some, those of us in whose NEIGHBORHOODS this is taking place have to live through weekni~hts of interrupted sleep because of prostitution’s accompanying problems: frequent shouting to solicit; unwelcome invitations; obstruction of traffic; long lines of cars circling our blocks, blowing horns at ]am, 2am, and 3am; crowds gathered on street corners, talking all night; public beatings of prostitutes by their employers; and assemblies of pimps in thierflashycars, in front of our homes. The constituents I represent are a diverse mix of apartment and condominium dwellers, slngle-family homeowners, and public housing residents. The single member district- is majority hispanic and African-American. The most vocal complaints have come from African-American residents of Frontiers Public Housing, My friend and neighbor there, Wayne Person, says the pimps park in front of their houses because they assume public hod~ing residents won’t care, or won’t have weight with city officials or police. They don’t know these people are enrolled in a home- page two, testimony before Committee on the Judiciary ownership plan, are tax-payers, and docare A GREAT DEAL about the quality of life here. Wayne’s wife, Charlene, worries about her young son’s premature exposure to an u__q].yl picture of human sexuality. Like many children in our neighborhood, he is regularly awakened at night by sexual activities in the alley rightbehind their house. The police are overworked and, thanks to City Council’s ill- advised cuts in police pay, have sometimes been less than responsive. But with existing laws, what can they tell taxpayers who complain about prostitutes on the corner? When they level with you, the answer is not much; they’ve got bigger issues to deal with, and the~tool they have to fight our deteriorating quality of life is the "Failure to Obey It must be as frustrating to them as it is to us that the women they arrest can pay the low fine and’be back on the street the same night. Interim Chief Soulsby, the District commanders, and the Sector Captains have all worked closely with community leaders and Councilmember Evans’ office, over the course of several ~nths, to address the problem and to draft this proposed legislation. We, the citizens, trust their judgement and integrity to use the additional powers as they’re intended. In addition, we have been generously assisted by Judicial officials in the creation of this legislation. What can I tell my constituents when they complain about the disruption in their lives? I’ve been telling them we’re working on it. Please, I urge you to adopt this legislation, making it possible to actually [~ something concrete about this problem. If you don’t, citizens who can afford to do so will have one more reason to leave our city behind. Thank you. Sincerely, Robert Riddle Attachment 28 STATEMENT ON BEHALF OF ASBURY UNITED METHODIST CHURCH on the "Safe Streets Anti-Prostitution Amendment Act of 1995 Good afternoon, Mr. Chairman, other members of the Council of the District of Columbia. My name is Grace Bradford. I am a member of Asbury United Methodist Church where, among other things, I serve as Chairperson of the Council on Ministries. This statement is provided to the Council as it considers anti- prostitution legislation introduced by Councilmember Evans. We support the "Safe Streets Anti-Prostitution Amendment Act of 1995 Its purpose is aimed at curbing prostitution in downtown Washington, especially as it occurs in and around our Church and Child Development Center. As you may know, Asbury United Methodist Church has been a part of the Washington, D.C. community for more than 159 years. Throughout our 159 year history, we have been located at-the corner of Eleventh and K Streets, N.W. Never before in the history of our Church have we been so cleariy affected by the practice this bill is aimed at stopping. Page two On a number of occasions after evening services or meetings, our congregants and others visiting our Church have been greeted by heavy traffic circling the street blocks near the Church. People in these cars appear to be talking from their.cars to young women and men on the street, and sometimes the person on the street gets in the car. We have been advised by the police and businesses in the area that prostitution is now flourishing in and around our area. This practice must stop. It is indecent. As a Church community, it violates the most basic tenets of our faith. That it is now so prominently and flagrantly practiced near a Church and a church affiliated nursery school speaks volumes about the hardened sensitivities of everybody involved in this activity. We must use all reasonable means at our disposal to combat it. That is why we think the approach taken by this legislation may prove helpful. While Asbury United Methodist Church wholehearted!y supports this bill, our membership also believes that the District, in cooperation with private groups, must als6 seek to discourage the behavior in the first instance and rescue these young girls an~ boys from this type of life. Page three There are groups in the District which counsel the people involved in this activity. They are small, and often lack adequate funding. But they must be encouraged and supported. Our Church has an outreach program for the homeless and the hungry. While we have not targeted our efforts at eliminating prostitution, believing this to be mainly a matter for law enforcement, we now understand that these groups need our support. They may now expect to get it. Making the penalties stricter for being involved in this activity is a necessary step to curbing it. However, we are not naive. Tougher sanctions alone will not stop it. But making it more costly to be caught in the act will help. This community may also help to abate this problem by providing more counseling on sexually transmitted diseases, making available more drug treatment opportunities, and working tirelessly to keep our children in school and helping them to identify meaningful employment. committed to these goals. As an inner-city Church, we are Page four Mr. Chairman, Asbury recognizes that help comes in many forms. This legislation is one way to help. It is a proven method of altering behavior. So is prayer and’petition to a Source greater than ourselves. You may count on Asburyans to do this and a great deal more. Thank you for providing Asbury United Methodist Church with an opportunity to submit this statement in strong support of legislation to clean up our streets and save our community from further decay. Attachment 29 My name is Ruth Burness. I am Chairman of the Community Liaison Committee and one of 200 Senior Citizens living at Thomas House Retirement Home at 1330 Massachusetts Ave, N.W. We are directly and constantly increasingly bombarded and affected by the pros- titution activity. It goes on in front of our building. Vehlc~s unload the girls at ~the curb in front of our building. The girls solicit busi~ ss and rform their acts on our front lawn an he adjacent alley. This is unendurable, distasteful, obscene, dangerous and filthy. Thanks to Jack Evans for caring enough to draft and to introduce this legislation. Hooefully there are sufficient teeth in this bill, and hopefully it will be stringently enforced ~y our courageous police and hopefully we soon will experience a more livable downtown that will benefit our Thomas House residents as well as all of the District of Columbia. October 23, 1995 Thank you Ruth C. Burness 1330 Massachusetts Avenue, NW #405 Washington, DC 20005 202-347-2837 Attachment 30 ashington D.C. Acco nodations 25 October 1995 Mr. William Lightfoot Chair, The Judiciary Committee The District Government 1350 Pennsylvania Avenue NW Washington, D.C. Mr. Lightfoot, I am a D.C. resident and the owner of the DC based company, Washington DC Accommodations, a hotel reservation service for the nation’s Capital. I am also a Board Member of the DC Chamber of Commerce and Chair of the Chamber’s Convention and Tourism Committee. As you know, the businesses that make up the tourism industry in Washington are the largest private sector generator of revenue and jobs for this city. The city must do everything it can to encouraqe.and support these businesses. Hotels and specifically the Days Inn Downtown 1201 K Street NW, have spent millions of dollars upgrading their private properties as well as the public space like tree lawns, and sidewalks to enhance the beauty of this city and to attract and retain visitors. It is unacceptable that the business community spends its money and pays its taxes, but can not, in return, get the city government to impose and enforce strict prostitution laws to drive that business out of the District. Each caller we assist with hotel reservations asks us about the neighborhoods and their safety. We assure them that they will be comfortable with our recommendations. The presence of prostitutes does not reinforce their feeling of safety and comfort. All residents of this city benefit from the money spent by the millions of tourists and conventioneers who stay in Washington DC. My company’s commitment is to sell people into the city hotels instead of the suburbs. The Council’s commitment to the economic well-being of the city must be to make DC a desirable place to stay by having and enforcing stricter prostitution laws.
