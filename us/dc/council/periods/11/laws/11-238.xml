In either case, the claimant may also recover incidental but not consequential damages.

If (i) this article would govern the liability of an issuer, nominated person, or adviser under subsection (a) or (b) of this section ii) the relevant undertaking incorporates rules of custom or practice, and (iii) there is conflict between this article and those rules as applied to that undertaking, those rules govern except to the extent of any conflict with the nonvariable provisions specified in § 28:5-103(c d) If there is conflict between this article and Article 3, 4, 4A, or 9, this article governs e) The forum for settling disputes arising out of an undertaking within this article may be chosen in the manner and with the binding effect that governing law may be chosen in accordance with subsection (a) of this section § 28:5-117. Subrogation of issuer, applicant, and nominated person a) An issuer that honors a beneficiary’s presentation is subrogated to the rights of the beneficiary to the same extent as if the issuer were a secondary obligor of the underlying obligation owed to the beneficiary and of the applicant to the same extent as if the issuer were the secondary obligor of the underlying obligation owed to the applicant b) An applicant that reimburses an issuer is subrogated to the rights of the issuer against any beneficiary, presenter, or nominated person to the same extent as if the applicant were the secondary obligor of the obligations owed to the issuer and has the rights of subrogation of the issuer to the rights of the beneficiary stated in subsection (a) of this section c) A nominated person who pays or gives value against a draft or demand presented under a letter of credit is subrogated to the rights of 1) The issuer against the applicant to the same extent as if the nominated person were a secondary obligor of the obligation owed to the issuer by the applicant 2) The beneficiary to the same extent as if the nominated person were a secondary obligor of the underlying obligation owed to the beneficiary; and 3) The applicant to same extent as if the nominated person were a secondary obligor of the underlying obligation owed to the applicant d) Notwithstanding any agreement or term to the contrary, the rights of subrogation Section 28:5-117 10 ENROLLED ORIGINAL stated in subsections (a) and (b) of this section do not arise until the issuer honors the letter of credit or otherwise pays and the rights in subsection (c) of this section do not arise until the nominated person pays or otherwise gives value.
