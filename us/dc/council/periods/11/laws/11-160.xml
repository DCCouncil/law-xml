Washington, D.C. 20004 Memorandum To: From: Date: Subject: Members of the Council Phyllis Jones, Secretary to the Coun June 26, 1996 Correspondence from the Mayor Return of Unsigned Bill 11-157 Automobile Insurance Amendment Act of 1996 The attached correspondence regarding Bill 11-157 Automobile Insurance Amendment Act of 1996" which was retumed unsigned is circulated for your review and information. Copies may be obtained from the Legislative Services Division, Room 28. cc: Legislative Services Division General Counsel MARION BARRY. JR. MAYOR THE DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001 June 26, 1996 The Honorable David A. Clarke Chairman Council of the District of Columbia 1350 Pennsylvania Avenue, N.W. Washington, D.C. 20004 Dear Chairman Clarke: Today I am returning unsigned the "Automobile Insurance Amendment Act of 1996 The enactment of this legislation comes with a price tag to District residents. District residents will pay more for automobile insurance without receiving additional benefits. Moreover, District residents will pay an even greater price for the change in regulatory controls. Bill 11-157 Automobile Insurance Amendment Act of 1996" changes the manner in which auto insurance is regulated in the District and limits the amount of time the Superintendent of Insurance has when examining insurance policies. I am very concerned that Bill 11-157 will increase rates which will cause buyers to react unfavorably. For the foregoing reasons, I cannot sign Bill 11-157 Automobile Insurance Amendment Act of 1996 I do not believe Bill 11-157 is the best approach for this market. There are other alternatives which can_he-expt~rext: that: have-wQrked: wetl~ in t~ jufisdi~inns B ill Ll 1 7 falls, stmv of~the-Nati~anal Association of Insurance Commissioners (NAIC) model and the competitive rating structure adopted in the state of Maryland I believe District residents and automobile insurers deserve the best possible regulatory structure to ensure competitive rates and Bill 11-157 is clearly not the best alternative for the District.
