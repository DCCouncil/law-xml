Section 24-461 Section 24-463 Section 24-464 Section 24-465 Sec. 5. Fiscal impact statement. The U.S. Attorney’s Office plans to ask for pre-trial detention in 230 to 240 additional cases per year as the result of the Zero Tolerance for Guns Amendment Act of 1996. The Corrections Department Department estimates that the 240 additional inmates will generate 17,760 new "man" days (240 inmates detained for 74 days The Department originally estimated a $62.12 per diem cost for housing inmates within the Department. However, the cost for contracting out inmates could be approximately $45 to $55, with $55 being the most realistic. Assuming that the 240 additional inmates will be housed in contract units at a per diem cost of $55, the total annual cost of this act will be approximately $976,808 for the Department. The Superior Court estimates that there will be $150,000 in additional costs for hearings and the Public Defender Service indicates that it will need approximately $95,000 in additional funds. The Committee on the Judiciary Committee allocated $800,000 for the Department 150,000 for the Superior Court and $95,000 for the Public Defender Service for Fiscal Year 1997 to cover estimated costs in 1997. Because of the Congressional schedule, it is unlikely that this act will be in effect on October 1, 1996, the beginning of the fiscal year. The Committee projects that this act will not be in the effect for the first quarter of the fiscal year. Therefore, the total annual cost for the agencies involved should be less than anticipated. The ENROLLED ORIGINAL projected cost for the Department is $732,000; for the Superior Court 113,000; and for the Public Defender Service 71,000. The expenditure increases for these agencies are slightly in excess of the amounts recommended for funding by the Committee for Fiscal Year 1997. Sec. 6. Effective date. This act shall take effect following approval by the Mayor (or in the event of veto by the Mayor, action by the Council of the District of Columbia to override the veto approval by the Financial Responsibility and Management Assistance Authority as provided in section 203(a) of the District of Columbia Financial Responsibility and Management Assistance Authority Act of 1995, approved April 17, 1995 (109 Stat. 116; D.C.
