The Mayor shall hold such public hearing no earlier than 90 days prior to the 5-year anniversary, and no later than the 5-year anniversary, of the last BID registration.

No BID corporation shall engage in the financial support of political activities and candidates, or lobbying on legislative or administrative actions with respect to any property or area, or the promotion of one business to the exclusion of others. Nothing contained within this act shall be construed as modifying the terms of any lease or occupancy agreement between an owner and commercial tenant. Sec. 20. Maintenance of base level of city services. The District government shall not eliminate or reduce the level of any services customarily provided in the District to any similar geographic area because such area is subject to a BID, and shall continue to provide its customary services and levels of each service to such area notwithstanding that such area is or may be encompassed in a BID unless a reduction in service is part of a District-wide pro rata reduction in services necessitated by fiscal considerations or budgetary priorities. Sec. 21. Exempt property owners; BID membership. The District government, the federal government, or any residential property owner owning exempt real property located in the BID may, at their sole discretion, contribute their pro rata share of BID charges to the BID. Such exempt real property owners who voluntarily pay BID charges shall be entitled to full membership in the BID and all services provided to properties in the BID. Nothing in this act shall neither compel nor prohibit such exempt real property owners from contributing BID charges, becoming BID members, or receiving BID services. Sec. 22. Rulemaking. Pursuant to title 1 of the District of Columbia Administrative Procedures Act, approved October 21, 1968 (82 Stat. 1204; D.C. Code § 1-1501 et seq the Mayor is authorized to issue any rules that may be necessary to implement the provisions of this act, which shall include a fee to cover the administrative costs of processing a BID application and holding a public hearing. No delay in issuing any rules beyond 120 days after the enactment of this act shall prevent an applicant from filing all application with the Mayor, or prevent the Mayor from registering a BID. Sec. 23. Fiscal impact. Nothing in this act shall cause the District government to spend general fund revenues on either administering BIDs or on BID activities. Incidental costs associated with processing BID applications and holding administrative hearings may be incurred; however, the Mayor shall charge the applicant fees to cover these costs. Based on the experiences of Business Improvement Districts in other cities, the creation of BIDs in the District of Columbia is anticipated to have a positive economic impact on those areas. Passage of this act and the New Section 2288 New Section 2289 New Section 1-2290 New Section 1-2291 14 ENROLLED ORIGINAL creation of BIDs should increase cleanliness, safety, and marketing in BID areas. Cities with existing BIDs have had positive economic impacts, and consequently, indirect positive fiscal impacts from increased tax revenues, and have experienced increased commercial occupancy rates, increased retail sales, and lower reported crime.

Effective date a) This act shall take effect following approval by the Mayor (or in the event of veto by the Mayor, action by the Council to override the veto approval by the Financial Responsibility and Management Assistance Authority as provided in section 203(a) of the District of Columbia Financial Responsibility and Management Assistance Authority Act of 1995, approved April 17, 1995 (109 Stat. 116; D.C.
