ENROLLED ORIGINAL Sec. 6. Fiscal Impact In that the District is not creating a new pension ftmd, but merely establishing a third tier to its existing plans for new police officers, fire fighters, and teachers hired on or after October 1, 1996, this will not create a need for the District to provide for additional annual budget outlays to meet its anticipated pension payments, pursuant to the prescribed funding formula set forth in Public Law 96-122 District of Columbia Retirement Reform Act In every year since 1979, the District has made payments to the retirement ftmds that are more than adequate to finance the cost of benefits earned since Home Rule was implemented in 1975--In other words, the District government has more than fully funded its share of the plans. In that this new tier would be subject to the same funding formula as existing plans, it would not generate any additional expense to the District. However, in that the benefit provided by this new tier are less generous than those offered by the existing plans, the District will realize substantial savings, with respect to benefit payments that will be required to be disbursed when members of this third tier are eligible to receive payments. In other words, this new tier substantially reduces benefits for new hires, while not creating additional costs to the District, and will also generate substantial savings in future years. This represents significant cost avoidance. However, if Delegate Norton’s bill (H.R. 3389) is passed, or Congress takes some similar action in addressing the unfunded liability, the District will begin to realize savings much earlier. Sec. 7. This act shall take effect following approval by the Mayor (or in the event of veto by the Mayor, action by the Council to override the veto approval by the Financial Responsibility and Management Assistance Authority as provided in section 203(a) of the District of Columbia Financial Responsibility and Management Assistance Act of 1995, approved April 17, 1995 (109 Stat. 116; D.C.
