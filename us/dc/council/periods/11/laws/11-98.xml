Law 10-128; D.C. Code § 47-2751 et seq New Section 47-398.5 Note, Section 47-2751 TITLE XIV APPLICABILITY Sec. 1401. Sections 201,301,302, 1203 shall apply upon enactment by Congress of the District of Columbia Appropriations Act, 1996. TITLE XV FISCAL IMPACT Sec. 1501. Fiscal impact statement. Titles I Retirement/Voluntary Incentive Study Council enactment of the "Revised Fiscal Year 1996 Budget Request Act of 1995" assumed that as many as 1,000 FTE’s would take a retirement or voluntary Incentive. Title I requires that the Mayor identify which positions, if any, in each agency can be made eligible for such an incentive/retirement without impairing the ability of the agency to accomplish its mission. Following this identification, the Council will consider enacting a new set of retirement incentive programs. Titles H and HI Modification of RIF Procedures The restriction on "bumping rights" has no measurable fiscal impact but the net impact on productivity should be positive as any RIF will be less disruptive than it might have been. 15 ENROLLED ORIGINAL Titles V Contracting Out Title V liberalizes the District Government’s ability to out-source government operations. The Revised FY96 Budget Request Act required certain operations to be out-sourced. The Council assumed no net savings in FY96 to reflect the absorption of one-time start-up costs. The Authority adjusted the budget to show small savings. In Fiscal Years 1997 through 2000 the Bill requires that a savings of at least 5% be realized. For the areas the Council identified for out-sourcing in the Fiscal Year 1996 budget those minimum savings are: 1. DC Village 1.4 million 2. Food Services DCPS 1.8 million 3. Security DCPS 4 million 4. Medical MPD 1 million 5. Correctional Treatment Facility DOC 1.2 million To the extent to which a 5% savings cannot be realized and therefore a contract is not let, the lesser savings will not be reflected in the government’s expenditures. The Bill also requires that a contractor offer (as a right of first refusal) positions to existing employees where there is an available position of which the employee is qualified. The Council does not believe that this requirement is onerous but to the extent that it decreases the propensity of potential contractors to bid on contracts the fiscal impact will be negative. At the same time, if the right of first refusal causes increased employment of displaced government workers there may be savings to the government through reduced unemployment insurance costs and, if that same employee is a District resident, avoidance of lost income tax and other income related revenues. The bill also requires that the federal "Contract Services Act" be applied to water and sewer service workers in an effort to assure the federal protections apply to this area which the federal law excludes. In general, the application of the federal law may, as with any qualification placed on out-sourcing, decrease the propensity of a contractor to bid or influence any eventual bid so as to increase costs and have a negative fiscal impact. The Bill further requires that the Mayor conduct a cost-benefit analysis to determine the total impact of any given contract on both the expenditures of the government and the District’s economy to measure any secondary revenue and expenditure impacts. This requirement is intended to cause more informed decision making and is expected to have a positive fiscal impact. Title VI: Transition Benefits for Displaced Workers The Bill provides for certain benefits to displaced District government employees and caps expenditures to available appropriations. The Revised FY96 Budget Act contains $1.5 16 ENROLLED ORIGINAL million for such expenditures and the administrative costs of the program will be absorbed by the Department of Employment Services existing out-placement program. The cap on expenditures is modeled after a cap which the Council placed on the non- union optical and dental program in Fiscal Year 1995. The program was left in place but funding was reduced by half with the limitation on expenditures at the appropriated level. The program ceased paying benefits when the funding was exhausted. The pending Fiscal Year 1996 Budget provided for the out-sourcing of 3,666 FTE’s and the outright elimination of another 350 FTE’s. At this time these represent the universe of possible applicants for these benefits. The Bill has two restrictions regarding eligibility of applicants. First, only District residents may apply. Approximately 40% of Government employees are District residents and therefore only 40% of the separated employees would be eligible for the program. Secondly, employees who fail to accept a position they have been offered under the first-refusal rights provided in the contracting-out provisions, are not eligible for the benefits. Title VH: Monitoring Committee The creation of a monitoring committee should have a positive fiscal impact as it should increase the propensity of the Government to follow through with initiatives designed to reduce costs. Title VIII: Chief Information Officer (CIO) The creation of a CIO should have a positive fiscal impact as it should improve the government’s ability to collect, analyze and disseminate information. The Bill anticipates that the costs of this office will be covered through the consolidation of existing resources. Title IX: Debt Restructuring The Original and Revised FY96 Budgets both assumed that the District would restructure a portion of outstanding debt to reduce debt service in Fiscal Year 1996. The Executive Branch indicated that such a restructuring could only be successful if sold through a negotiated bid rather than a competitive offering. Title XI allows for such a negotiated sale and in that respect has a positive fiscal impact of $70 million FY96. 17 ENROLLED ORIGINAL Title X: Revised Cash Flow The requirement of a cash flow statement will have no fiscal impact. Title XI: Outside Employee Assignments Expansion of the ability of the District to accept temporary employees from the private sector or other government entities will have no immediate fiscal impact. In the long run, however, the impact should be positive due to increased productivity. Title XH: Special Provisions DCPS 1. Adult Education Fees The Public Schools are authorized to charge certain increased fees for Adult Education. The Board estimates that there will be positive fiscal impact of $462 thousand per year from FY96 to 2000. 2. Jr. ROTC Programs The Bill mandates that active duty military officers or noncommissioned officers of the US Armed Forces be detailed to fill 18 FTE’s in the Schools Jr. ROTC Program beginning in FY96. No savings are anticipated in FY96 to reflect the need for separation costs of existing employees. For Fiscal Year 1997 the savings are expected to be $32 thousand per average for each of the 18 PTE’s or $576 thousand per Fiscal Year. Title XHI: Property Tax Rates Tire XIII of Bill 11-440 maintains the FY 1996 real property tax rates at the same aggregate rate for each of the five classes of real property that was in effect in fiscal years 1994 and 1995. The fiscal impact of this act on the District government’s Fiscal Year 1996 budget will be nonexistent. This is because the revenue estimates to support the FY 1996 budget already reflect the totals, by class, of the rates established by this act. When the Council acted on April 19, 1995 to adopt the FY 1996 budget it adopted an amendment to the revenue tables of the Committee of the Whole report on that budget act to reflect real property tax rates existent in FY 1994 as opposed to the calculated rates, which had gone into effect pursuant to D.C. Code § § 47-812(a) and 47-815(c There has been considerable controversy over the past year regarding what the real property tax rates should be. If the rates were set higher than established herein, there would be 18 ENROLLED ORIGINAL a positive fiscal impact. However, this would be offset somewhat by the perception of unacceptable tax burden which is a factor in taxpayer’s decisions to locate or remain in the District of Columbia. On the other hand, the effect of maintaining the same aggregate tax rates in the present real estate market is to provide tax relief (because the aggregate assessment base has continued to drop and therefore applying the unchanged tax rates produces lower tax bills for the average real property taxpayer When comparing estimated total real property tax revenues for FY 1996 with actuals for FY 1991, the tax relief for 1996 will total approximately $I 16 million.
