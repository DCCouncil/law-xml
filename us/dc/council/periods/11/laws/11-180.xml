Code § 29-501 etseq Sec. 6. Administration of the foundation. The Secretary to the Council is responsible for the administration of the Foundation. No more than 15% of the total funds raised in any given year can be used for the administrative support, including staff, supplies, and promotional activities of the Foundation. Sec. 7. Sunset provision. If the Foundation has returned monies deposited in the Fund pursuant to section 4(h the Foundation shall cease all operations. Sec. 8. Fiscal Impact. Enactment of the Establishment of the John A. Wilson Building Foundation Act of 1996 is not expected to have any adverse fiscal impact upon the District of Columbia government. The purpose of this act, like the purpose of the related Wilson Building development plan approved by Council Resolution 11-172, is to ensure that neither the District government nor the Council will be subiect to any financial responsibilities associated with the renovation and restoration of the Wilson Building. The District has neither operating nor capital funds necessary to address serious environmental and structural deficiencies which have existed in the New, Section 9-735 New, Section 9-736 ENROLLED ORIGINAL Wilson Building for several years and which continue to worsen. Under the development plan approved by Council Resolution 11-172, the entire cost of renovation, restoration, temporary Council relocation, and future operational costs of the Wilson Building will be covered by the financing to be collateralized by the General Services Administration GSA lease of a part of a renovated and expanded Wilson Building. The development plan will preserve and modernize an historic asset of the District government at no cost to the District. Moreover, because the District government currently pays approximately $680,000 for the annual cost of maintenance and operations of the Wilson Building, the development plan will result in a substantial positive fiscal impact upon the District government. If sufficient funds are raised by the Foundation to buy out or substitute for the financing to be collateralized by a GSA lease, then additional District-government owned space will be available for occupancy by District agencies which are currently leasing space, which would result in an undetermined amount of positive fiscal impact upon the District. Although section 6 of this act provides the Secretary to the Council with the responsibility for administering the Foundation, the costs of such administration either will be derived from the funds to be raised by the Foundation or will be absorbed by the Council within its overall budget. The contribution of funds to the Foundation would be tax deductible. In the unlikely event that such contributions were above and beyond the ordinary contribution levels of residents and businesses in the District, such tax deductible contributions could result in the loss of tax revenues to the District. Under the worst case scenario of this unlikely event, if $40 million were raised for the Foundation from contributions from District residents or businesses, and if all of this $40 million in tax deductible contributions would not have been made for other charitable purposes if the Foundation did not exist, then the loss of tax revenues from such contributions could be as high as $3.8 million, assuming a 9.5% tax rate for District residents and businesses contributing to the Foundation. Sec. 9. Effective date. This act shall take effect following approval by the Mayor (or in the event of veto by the Mayor, action by the Council to override the veto approval by the Financial Responsibility and Management Assistance Authority as provided in section 203(a) of the District of Columbia Financial Responsibility and Management Assistance Authority Act of 1995, approved April 17, 1995 (109 Star. 116; D.C.
