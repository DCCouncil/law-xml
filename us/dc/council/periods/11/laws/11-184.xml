Fiscal impact statement. 6 ENROLLED ORIGINAL The sections of this bill which make up the District of Columbia Water and Sewer Authority Amendment Act of 1996 will have a very slight fiscal impact on the D.C. Water and Sewer Authority. The amendments increase the size of the Water and Sewer Authority Board of Directors from 10 members to 11 members by adding one additional suburban jurisdiction member (and alternate These amendments clarify the responsibilities of the Water and Sewer Authority and the Authority’s relationship within the District of Columbia government which have no fiscal impact on the Authority. The increase in the Board membership will require a slight increase in the budget of the Authority to compensate the additional Board member (and alternate) and provide support costs. Under the enabling legislation, Board members who are not otherwise compensated by the District of Columbia government or one of the suburban iurisdictions shall be compensated at the rate of $50 per meeting, not to exceed $4,000 per year. Board members are also entitled to reimbursement of expenses, except that transportation, parking or mileage expenses incurred in the performance of official duties may be reimbursed, not to exceed $20 per meeting. We anticipate that the total expenditures for the additional Board member and altemate shall not exceed $5,000. Additional staffing costs to support one additional Board member should be negligible. Revenues to implement this amendment to the D.C. Water and Sewer Authority establishment act will be paid through the D.C. Water and Sewer Authority Enterprise Fund. The Enterprise Fund consists of funds raised through the District of Columbia water and sewer rate and funds paid by the wholesale customers of the Blue Plains Wastewater Treatment Plant. No appropriated funds will be required by the water and sewer sections of this act. As stated above, funding in future years will be provided through the Water and Sewer Enterprise Fund. TITLE III EFFECTIVE DATE Sec. 301.
