Action by majority. “ If there is more than one arbitrator, the powers of an arbitrator shall be exercised by a majority of the arbitrators, but all of them shall conduct the hearing under 16-4415(c “§ 16-4414.

ENROLLED ORIGINAL 8Codification District of Columbia Official Code, 2001 Edition West Group Publisher, 1-800-328-9378. “(b) The immunity afforded by this section supplements any immunity under other law. “(c) The failure of an arbitrator to make a disclosure required by 16-4412 does not cause any loss of immunity under this section. “(d) In a judicial, administrative, or similar proceeding, an arbitrator is not competent to testify, and may not be required to produce records as to any statement, conduct, decision, or ruling occurring during the arbitration proceeding, to the same extent as a judge of a court of the District of Columbia acting in a judicial capacity. This subsection does not apply: “(1) To the extent necessary to determine the claim of an arbitrator against a party to the arbitration proceeding; or “(2) To a hearing on a motion to vacate an award under 16-4423(a)(1) or (2) if the movant establishes prima facie that a ground for vacating the award exists. “(e) If a person commences a civil action against an arbitrator arising from the services of the arbitrator or if a person seeks to compel an arbitrator to testify or produce records in violation of subsection (d) of this section, and the court decides that the arbitrator is immune from civil liability or that the arbitrator is not competent to testify, the court shall award to the arbitrator reasonable attorney=s fees and other reasonable expenses of litigation. “§ 16-4415. Arbitration process. “(a) An arbitrator may conduct an arbitration in such manner as the arbitrator considers appropriate for a fair and expeditious disposition of the proceeding. The authority conferred upon the arbitrator includes the power to hold conferences with the parties to the arbitration proceeding before the hearing and, among other matters, determine the admissibility, relevance, materiality, and weight of any evidence. “(b) An arbitrator may decide a request for summary disposition of a claim or particular issue: “(1) If all interested parties agree; or “(2) Upon request of one party to the arbitration proceeding if that party gives notice to all other parties to the proceeding, and the other parties have a reasonable opportunity to respond. “(c)(1) If an arbitrator orders a hearing, the arbitrator shall set a time and place and give notice of the hearing not less than 5 days before the hearing begins. Unless a party to the arbitration proceeding makes an objection to lack or insufficiency of notice not later than the beginning of the hearing, the party=s appearance at the hearing waives the objection. “(2) Upon request of a party to the arbitration proceeding and for good cause shown, or upon the arbitrator=s own initiative, the arbitrator may adjourn the hearing from time to time, as necessary, but may not postpone the hearing to a time later than that fixed by the agreement to arbitrate for making the award unless the parties to the arbitration proceeding consent to a later date. “(3) The arbitrator may hear and decide the controversy upon the evidence produced although a party who was duly notified of the arbitration proceeding did not appear. ENROLLED ORIGINAL 9Codification District of Columbia Official Code, 2001 Edition West Group Publisher, 1-800-328-9378. “(4) The court, on request, may direct the arbitrator to conduct the hearing promptly and render a timely decision. “(d) At a hearing under subsection (c) of this section, a party to the arbitration proceeding has a right to be heard, to present evidence material to the controversy, and to cross-examine witnesses appearing at the hearing. “(e) If an arbitrator ceases or is unable to act during the arbitration proceeding, a replacement arbitrator shall be appointed in accordance with 16-4411 to continue the proceeding and to resolve the controversy. “§ 16-4416.

A subpoena shall be served in the manner for service of subpoenas in a civil action and, upon motion to the court by a party to the arbitration proceeding or the arbitrator, enforced in the manner for enforcement of subpoenas in a civil action. “(b) To make the proceedings fair, expeditious, and cost effective, upon request of a party to or a witness in an arbitration proceeding, an arbitrator may permit a deposition of any witness to be taken for use as evidence at the hearing, including a witness who cannot be subpoenaed for or is unable to attend a hearing. The arbitrator shall determine the conditions under which the deposition is taken. “(c) An arbitrator may permit such discovery as the arbitrator decides is appropriate in the circumstances, taking into account the needs of the parties to the arbitration proceeding and other affected persons and the desirability of making the proceeding fair, expeditious, and cost effective. “(d) If an arbitrator permits discovery under subsection (c) of this section, the arbitrator may: “(1) Order a party to the arbitration proceeding to comply with the arbitrator=s discovery-related orders; “(2) Issue subpoenas for the attendance of a witness and for the production of records and other evidence at a discovery proceeding; and “(3) Take action against a noncomplying party to the extent a court could if the controversy were the subject of a civil action in the District of Columbia. “(e) An arbitrator may issue a protective order to prevent the disclosure of privileged information, confidential information, trade secrets, and other information protected from disclosure to the extent a court could if the controversy were the subject of a civil action in the District of Columbia. “(f) All laws compelling a person under subpoena to testify and all fees for attending a judicial proceeding, a deposition, or a discovery proceeding as a witness apply to an arbitration ENROLLED ORIGINAL 10Codification District of Columbia Official Code, 2001 Edition West Group Publisher, 1-800-328-9378. proceeding as if the controversy were the subject of a civil action in the District of Columbia. “(g)(1) The court may enforce a subpoena or discovery-related order for the attendance of a witness within the District of Columbia and for the production of records and other evidence issued by an arbitrator in connection with an arbitration proceeding in another state upon conditions determined by the court so as to make the arbitration proceeding fair, expeditious, and cost effective. “(2) A subpoena or discovery-related order issued by an arbitrator in another state shall be served in the manner provided by law for service of subpoenas in a civil action in the District of Columbia and, upon motion to the court by a party to the arbitration proceeding or the arbitrator, enforced in the manner provided by law for enforcement of subpoenas in a civil action in the District of Columbia. § 16-4418. Judicial enforcement of preaward ruling by arbitrator. “ If an arbitrator makes a preaward ruling in favor of a party to the arbitration proceeding, the party may request the arbitrator to incorporate the ruling into an award under 16-4419. A prevailing party may make a motion to the court for an expedited order to confirm the award under 16-4422, in which case the court shall summarily decide the motion. The court shall issue an order to confirm the award unless the court vacates, modifies, or corrects the award under 16-4423 or 16-4424. § 16-4419. Award. “(a) An arbitrator shall make a record of an award. The record shall be signed or otherwise authenticated by any arbitrator who concurs with the award.

The court may extend, or the parties to the arbitration proceeding may agree in a record to extend, the time. The court or the parties may do so within or after the time specified or ordered. A party waives any objection that an award was not timely made unless the party gives notice of the objection to the arbitrator before receiving notice of the award. “§ 16-4420. Change of award by arbitrator. “(a) On motion to an arbitrator by a party to an arbitration proceeding, the arbitrator may modify or correct an award: “(1) Upon a ground stated in 16-4424(a)(1) or (3 “(2) Because the arbitrator has not made a final and definite award upon a claim submitted by the parties to the arbitration proceeding; or “(3) To clarify the award b) A motion under subsection (a) of this section shall be made and notice given to all parties within 20 days after the movant receives notice of the award. “(c) A party to the arbitration proceeding shall give notice of any objection to the ENROLLED ORIGINAL 11Codification District of Columbia Official Code, 2001 Edition West Group Publisher, 1-800-328-9378. motion within 10 days after receipt of the notice. “(d) If a motion to the court is pending under 16-4422, 16-4423, or 16-4424, the court may submit the claim to the arbitrator to consider whether to modify or correct the award: “(1) Upon a ground stated in 16-4424(a)(1) or (3 “(2) Because the arbitrator has not made a final and definite award upon a claim submitted by the parties to the arbitration proceeding; or “(3) To clarify the award. “(e) An award modified or corrected pursuant to this section is subject to 16-4419(a 16-4422, 16-4423, and 16-4424. A' 16-4421. Remedies; fees and expenses of arbitration proceeding. “(a) An arbitrator may award punitive damages or other exemplary relief if such an award is authorized by law in a civil action involving the same claim and the evidence produced at the hearing justifies the award under the legal standards otherwise applicable to the claim. “(b) An arbitrator may award reasonable attorney=s fees and other reasonable expenses of arbitration if such an award is authorized by law in a civil action involving the same claim or by the agreement of the parties to the arbitration proceeding. “(c) As to all remedies other than those authorized by subsections (a) and (b) of this section, an arbitrator may order such remedies as the arbitrator considers just and appropriate under the circumstances of the arbitration proceeding. The fact that such a remedy could not or would not be granted by the court is not a ground for refusing to confirm an award under 16- 4422 or for vacating an award under 16-4423. “(d) An arbitrator=s reasonable expenses and fees, together with other expenses, shall be paid as provided in the award. “(e) If an arbitrator awards punitive damages or other exemplary relief under subsection (a) of this section, the arbitrator shall specify in the award the basis in fact justifying and the basis in law authorizing the award and state separately the amount of the punitive damages or other exemplary relief. “§16-4422. Confirmation of award.
