The proposed rules shall be transmitted to the Council for a 60-day period of review, excluding Saturdays, Sundays, legal holidays, and days of Council recess. If the Council does not approve or disapprove the proposed rules by resolution within the 60-day review period, the proposed rules shall be deemed approved. “(6) Certain definitions and explanations arising from the written disclosures required under this section shall be printed on a single page, front and back, and include the following: “Beginning interest rate: means the interest rate the borrower pays at the beginning of the loan. In many types of loans, this rate is good for only a few years and may increase significantly. “Fully indexed rate: is an indicator of what will happen to the interest rate on the loan and the monthly payments. It is today’s estimate of how high the interest rate on an adjustable rate mortgage will go. It is calculated by taking a defined index rate and adding a certain number of percentage points, called the margin. Since the index rate can go up or down, the borrower cannot be sure what the future adjustable interest rate will be. Borrowers must make sure they can afford the fully indexed interest rate and not just the initial interest rate. “Maximum possible interest rate: means the highest your interest rate can go. Most loans with adjustable rates have a defined maximum rate or lifetime cap. Borrowers need to think about how likely it may be that the interest rate can go this high. “Gross monthly income: means the borrower’s gross, pre-tax income per month. Borrowers should make sure the monthly household income amount shown on the form is correct. “Monthly mortgage payment including taxes and insurance: means the amount the borrower must pay every month for interest, repayment of loan principal, home insurance premiums, and property taxes owed to the District of Columbia. Over time, in addition to any possible increases in the loan’s interest rate, the insurance premiums and property taxes are likely to increase. “Prepayment penalty: means any additional fee imposed by the mortgage lender on the borrower if the borrower pays off the loan early. Borrowers must make sure they know whether their loan has a prepayment penalty fee and how it works. “Balloon payment: means that a large repayment of loan principal is due at the end of the loan. This almost always means that the borrower has to get a new loan to make the balloon payment. “Payment option loan: means a mortgage loan that allows the borrower to pay less than the interest being charged on the loan. The unpaid interest is added to the loan, so the loan amount grows larger. Borrowers must make sure they know whether their loan is a payment option loan and how it works. “Points: means the fee, expressed as a percentage of the loan, a borrower pays to the mortgage lender at closing, usually in exchange for a lower interest rate. “Default: means a borrower has failed to make the payments due on the mortgage loan. Once a borrower is in default on the loan, the mortgage lender can seek to foreclose on the property. “Foreclosure: means the legal process in which the mortgage lender can seize the borrower’s property if the borrower continually fails to make the payments due on the mortgage loan. “Property tax: means the taxes owed to the District of Columbia as a result of the ENROLLED ORIGINAL 5Codification District of Columbia Official Code, 2001 Edition West Group Publisher, 1-800-328-9378. borrower owning the property. “Insurance: means property insurance that covers private homes and residences. It is required by mortgage loans in order to protect the mortgage lender if the home is destroyed. “Monthly condominium/co-operative/homeowner association fees: means the monthly fees that must be paid by the borrower if the borrower’s property is a condominium, co- operative, or subject to a homeowner association. These fees usually are collected on a monthly basis. Failure to pay these fees can result in a lawsuit against the borrower by the condominium, co-operative, or homeowner association. As with property taxes and homeowners’ insurance, these fees are likely to increase over time. “(7) The Commissioner may prescribe, by rule, additional terms, definitions, and explanations. The proposed rules shall be transmitted to the Council for a 60-day period of review, excluding Saturdays, Sundays, legal holidays, and days of Council recess. If the Council does not approve or disapprove the proposed rules by resolution within the 60-day review period, the proposed rules shall be deemed approved. “(8) The information pursuant to this section shall be given to the borrower in a prominent form, separate from other disclosures, in either electronic or physical form and: “(A) In a 12-point font; “(B) In plain English or in the language of the mortgage lender’s presentation to the borrower; and “(C) If given to the borrower on a physical piece of paper, shall be printed on a red piece of paper measuring 8.5 inches by 11 inches. “(9) Within 5 business days of receiving from the mortgage lender the information pursuant to this section, the borrower may cancel the application for a mortgage loan with no loss of any security deposit or any other funds applied to guarantee an interest rate, not including reasonable fees incurred to process the application. The borrower shall be notified of this right to cancel at the time the mortgage lender provides the information pursuant to this section.”. Sec. 3. Section 28-3904 of the District of Columbia Official Code is amended as follows a) Paragraph (cc) is amended by striking the phrase “; or” and inserting a semicolon in its place b) Paragraph (dd) is amended by striking the period and inserting a semicolon in its place c) Paragraph (ee) is amended by striking the period and inserting the phrase “; or” in its place d) A new paragraph (ff) is added to read as follows: “(ff) fail to make a disclosure as required by § 26-1113(a-1).”. Sec. 4. Applicability. Section 2 shall apply 30 days after the effective date of this act. Sec. 5. Fiscal impact statement. The Council adopts the fiscal impact statement in the committee report as the fiscal impact statement required by section 602(c)(3) of the District of Columbia Home Rule Act, approved December 24, 1973 (87 Stat. 813; D.C.
