      <text>There is established within the General Fund of the District of Columbia a special
      nonlapsing account to be denominated as the "Verizon Center Fund." The Chief Financial
      Officer shall pay into the Verizon Center Fund all receipts from those taxes and fees specifically
      identified by any provision of District of Columbia law to be paid into the fund. The Chief
      Financial Officer shall create a sub-account within the Verizon Center Fund for each type of tax
      and fee that is to be paid into the fund and shall allocate the receipts from each type of tax and
      fee to the appropriate sub-account. The Mayor may pledge and create a security interest in the
      funds in the Verizon Center Fund, or any sub-account or sub-accounts within the fund for the
      payment of the debt service on the bonds.</text>
