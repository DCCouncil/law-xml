In determining the relevant product and geographical markets, the Mayor shall give due consideration to, among other things, the definitions or guidelines, if any, promulgated by the National Association of Insurance Commissioners and to information, if any, submitted by parties to the acquisition. In the absence of sufficient information to the contrary, the relevant product market is assumed to be the direct written insurance premium for a line of business, the line being that used in the annual statement required to be filed by insurers doing business in the District, and the relevant geographical market is assumed to be the District D) The burden of showing prima facie evidence of violation of the competitive standard rests upon the Mayor E) Even though an acquisition is not prima facie violative of the competitive standard under subparagraphs (A) and (B) of this paragraph, the Mayor may establish the requisite anticompetitive effect based upon other substantial evidence. Even though an acquisition is prima facie violative of the competitive standard under subparagraphs (A) and (B) of this paragraph, a party may establish the absence of the requisite anticompetitive effect based upon other substantial evidence. l~elevant factors in making a determination under this paragraph include, but are not limited to, the following: market shares, volatility of ranking 10 Enrolled Original of marketleaders, number of competitors, concentration, trend of concentration in the industry, and ease of entry and exit into the market 3) An order may not be entered under subsection (e)(1) through (4) of this section if A) The acquisition will yield substantial economies of scale or economies in resource utilization that feasibly cannot be achieved in any other way, and the public benefits which would arise from these economies exceed the public benefits which would arise from not lessening competition; or (B) The acquisition will substantially increase the availability o£ insurance, and the public benefits of this increase exceed the public benefits which would arise from not lessening competition e)(1) If an acquisition violates the standards of this section, the Mayor may enter an order A) Requiring an involved insurer to cease and desist from doing business in the District with respect to the line or lines of insurance involved in the violation; or (B) Denying the application of an acquired or acquiring insurer for a license to do business in the District 2) An order under this subsection shall not be entered unless A) There is a hearing B) Notice of the hearing is issued prior to the end of the waiting period and not less than 15 days prior to the hearing; and (C) The hearing is concluded and the order is issued no later than 60 days after the end of the waiting period.
