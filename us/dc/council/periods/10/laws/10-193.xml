Stabilizing and Improving the District’s Neighborhoods The successful and creative functioning of neighborhoods is a fundamental concern Citizen participation in civic improvement starts from the interest that people have in their neighborhood blocks and the day-to-day relationships therein. District services are directed primarily to homes and their environs The District elements of the Plan propose that the residential character of neighborhoods be maintained and improved. Many city neighborhoods are historic or possess social, economic, and physical qualities that make them unique and desirable places in which to live. These qualities can also lead to development and redevelopment pressures that threaten the very qualities that make the neighborhoods desirable. These pressures, and potential adverse impacts, must be controlled to ensure that the character of our neighborhoods are preserved and enhanced Many city neighborhoods also include integral commercial and institutional uses that contribute to their character and amenity. Neighborhood businesses, schools, park and recreational facilities, churches, and other public and private facilities all add to the liveability of our communities. These uses too must be protected, stabilized, and improved Promoting and ensuring good quality neighborhoods is of utmost importance to the District. The District elements of the Plan’s policies and strategies on increasing housing opportunities, neighborhood DCMR Enrolled Original commercial facilities, and improving transportation in some neighborhoods will be combined with other District policies on historic preservation, environmental quality, and public facilities to conserve functioning, stable neighborhoods, and to stabilize or improve those which need redirection B) Section 101.2 (10 DCMK 103) is amended to read as follows 2. Increasing the Quantity and Quality of Employment Opportunities in the District The expansion of the quality and quantity of employ[nent opportunities is a central theme of the District elements of the Plan. The District elements of the Plan aim at matching the resident population with the types of jobs which will be available over the next 20 years. Land development policies will be focused to create more jobs for District residents. Skill training opportunities and appropriate economic development are the key strategies to be employed C) Section 101.6 (10 DCMR 107) is amended to read as follows 6. Preserving and Ensuring Community Input Continuous community input into every phase of development of the Plan, from conception to adoption to implementation, is essential to assure that the Plan in all its elements is the valid expression of District residents, property owners, commercial interests, and other groups and individuals in the District. A variety of means to secure community input should be utilized, including advisory and technical committees, community workshops, review of draft texts, public forums and hearings, and other means of discussion and communication. The District government, through its executive and legislative branches, will strive to ensure that the Plan, in all its elements, is both responsive and responsible Community input into the implementation of the District elements of the Plan will be assured by the requirement of a periodic review. Not less frequently than once every four years, beginning January 31, 1998, the Mayor shall submit to the Council a report, accompanied by a proposed resolution, on the progress [nade by the government of the District of Columbia in implementing the District elements of the Comprehensive Plan The Council shall schedule a public hearing on the progress report and, following each review period, submit to the Mayor the findings of the Council and a copy of the public testimony on the progress report Each progress report shall include an action report, which shall detail, by Comprehensive Plan objective, lead agency, and fiscal year, any action required to implement the Comprehensive Plan.

Encouraging the broad spectrum of both private and public growth, with the appropriate level of supporting infrastructure, is central to achieving this end. This effort should focus on making maximum use of the District’s location at the center of the region’s radial Metrorail and commuter rail systems, freeway and highway networks, communication networks, and headquarter functions. Housing construction and rehabilitation of existing housing, for all income levels, is important to the success of this effort, as is the provision of quality public schools, recreational opportunities, and secure living and working environments This theme of economic growth is central to the District elements of the Plan It must be accomplished in a manner that protects and improves the quality of the natural and human environments for the District and the region. More efficient use of the District’s and the region’s infrastructure will contribute significantly to doing so. Promoting educational opportunities, expanding training programs in marketable job skills, matching the District’s employable population with the new kinds of jobs that will be created in the next 20 years, and providing more efficient, convenient, and environmentally appropriate modes of transportation, especially for the work and visitor trips, are key strategies to be employed in pursuing this theme 9. Promoting Enhanced Public Safety Enhanced public safety is one of the highest priorities of the District and is vital to the economic well-being of the District. The District can thrive and prosper only if residents, businesses, and visitors feel safe and secure in neighborhoods throughout the District. The District government, working in concert with the federal government and with the residential and business communities, must maximize available resources to reduce and prevent crimes against persons and property, particularly violent crimes. An essential component of this theme is the Enrolled Original District’s policy direction to reduce the number of illegal guns and other weapons in the District The District government must continue to improve responsiveness both to public requests for emergency police, fire, or medical assistance, and to other emergency situations ranging from infrastructure and public utility failures to natural disasters. Moreover, the District must engage in appropriate planning and capital projects that reduce the likelihood or severity of such emergencies in the future 10. Providing for Diversity and Overall Social l~esponsibilities Each distinct neighborhood of the District is an integral part of a diverse larger community that contributes to the District’s attractiveness and strength. Although many residents have sufficient means or individual support systems to be self-reliant, other residents are periodically more dependent on the larger community for support or assistance in their daily living. While the District must strive to increase educational, employment, and other opportunities to reduce such dependency, all neighborhoods should share in the overall social responsibilities of the community, including, but not limited to, housing the homeless, feeding the hungry, accommodating the disabled, and welcoming residents of diverse backgrounds and needs E) Section 102 (10 DCMI~ 109) is amended by adding a new paragraph at the end to read as follows The zoning impact of the District elements of the Plan is not limited to areas where amendments to the Zoning Regulations are required to eliminate inconsistencies between the Plan and zoning.

WAleD 1 FACILITIES a) The public facilities throughout Ward 1 play an important role in serving residents and contributing to the quality of the ward’s neighborhoods. These facilities include schools, parks, and recreation centers, libraries, police and fire stations, and health and cultural facilities. The following section highlights these facilities in Ward 1, some of which are designed to serve both the immediate areas and the city b) The public facilities goals of the District are to provide adequate public facilities in good condition to support the cost-effective delivery of municipal programs and services and to support economic development and neighborhood improvement and residential service objectives. ’1(c) A major survey of public facilities in Ward 1 is essential to determine maintenance problems and capital improvement needs. This is 85 F, HRf)U.F.I) ORIGINAl a) The Ward’s transportation system consists of a modern transit system, with subway and bus services, a comprehensive highway and street system, and special services for the elderly and handicapped. Transportation systems historically play a major role in shaping land uses b) Ward I is the smallest of the 8 wards, but because it is lust north of central Washington and has a large population, it requires and contains extensive transportation services. The Ward 1 transportation routes serve as conduits to the Downtown retail and employment centers c) Major commuter routes in the ward include 16th Street, l~ock Creek Parkway, Connecticut Avenue, Rhode Island Avenue, Massachusetts Avenue, and Georgia Avenue d) Traffic circulation west of 16th Street in Ward i is affected by the Rock Creek Parkway. Only Massachusetts and Connecticut Avenues, Park and Klingle I~oads, and Calvert Street provide cross-park service. As a result, congestion, particularly at Calvert Street and Connecticut Avenue, is a significant problem during rush hours e) Parking restrictions that improve the flow of rush hour traffic impose a hardship on residents who live on affected streets and have few alternatives for parking, l~esidents on 13th, 16th, Monroe, Kenyon, Irving, and Harvard and Warder Streets, Park Place and Columbia ]~oad are especially inconvenienced f) Public transportation is important in Ward 1. About 58% of households are without cars and, consequently, dependence on mass transportation in the ward is high. According to the 1990 census, the elderly, which comprise about 10.3% of the ward’s population, are usually transit dependent. The population under 18 years, 17.5% of the ward’s population, cannot drive and is considered transit dependent. Income distribution also suggests high transit dependence. Twenty percent of the 34,680 households in the ward earn less than $5000 a year. Another 18% of the households earn $5,000 to $15..000 a year g) Ward 1 is served by approximately 45 Metrobus routes. About 43% of the routes operate at least 20 hours per day, and 91% offer rush hour service at least once every 15 minutes. On thoroughfares such as Connecticut Avenue, where a number of lines operate, buses come as often as once every 5 to 7 minutes h) During off-peak hours, buses usually run once every 30 minutes with some operating once every 15 to 20 minutes. Saturday and Sunday service is also frequent. Over 50% of regular weekly service extends through the weekend i) The principal defect in transit service in Ward 1 is the limited east-west service. Primary routes for east-west travel across Rock Creek Park are 1/2 to I mile apart. Park and K]ingle Roads, Calvert Street, Connecticut Avenue, and Massachusetts Avenue are the only routes across l~ock Creek Park. On the east side of the ward, the few east-west routes through the extensive Howard University/Old Soldiers Home area are Rock Creek Church Road, Irving Street, Columbia ]~oad, and Harvard Street j) A 1981 study of small buses in District neighborhoods that was conducted by the ATE Management and Service Company found several transportation service problems in the ward. These problems are as follows 80 ENROLLED ORIGINAL 1) In Mount Pleasant, some residents complain that transit routes do not penetrate the neighborhood well. Since their community is hilly, the effort required to walk 3 to 4 blocks to bus stops discourages patronage, particularly for the large elderly population. Other residents complain that full-size buses on residential streets create excessive noise, vibration, and street congestion 2) The area between Columbia Road and Rock Creek Church Road west of Georgia Avenue lacks adequate bus service. Revisions to the crosstown l~oute H could make service comparable to that in the rest of the ward 3) Connections between residential neighborhoods and major destinations in the eastern part of the ward could be improved. Howard University Hospital and the Washington Hospital Center complex could be made more accessible k) The greatest complaint is that buses are overloaded during the peak hours. So many people use the bus in some neighborhoods, such as Adams Morgan and Mount Pleasant, that buses become full within a short distance. Passengers boarding later must ride standing. Buses traveling along 16th Street and Connecticut Avenue to Downtown from upper Northwest Washington and outlying areas in Maryland are crowded by the time they reach Ward 1 1) The ATE study limited its inquiry to the need for bus routes that serve neighborhoods. Actually, one of the greatest deficiencies in the mass transportation network is the limited links for commuting from the District to suburban jobs m) Certain activities in the ward increase the demand for parking, especially around the Connecticut Avenue business area, the "embassy row" employment area, the large hotel areas, the Howard University area, and 18th Street and Columbia Road in the Adams-Morgan area n) In the summer months, the National Zoo generates visitor parking. Activities at the nearby large hotels attract on-street parking in Woodley Park. Finally, many commuters avoid commercial parking fees by parking on streets near bus or Metrorail stations and then taking public transportation. Some Ward 1 streets have Residential Permit Parking RPP which allows residents to park in their neighborhoods during the day while limiting commuter parking o) The Metrorail subway system is having the greatest positive impact on land use in the District. Rapid rail service to the ward has been a high priority since the initial proposals for a regional system. Two Metrorail stations on the l~ed Line, located in 2 adjacent wards, serve Ward 1: the Woodley Park-Zoo Station in Ward 3, and the Dupont Circle Station in Ward 2 p) Stations at Shaw-Howard University and U Street-Cardozo have been completed. Trains began to run between U Street and Gallery Place by mid-1990 and service to Anacostia began in late 1991. Metro officials estimate that the Shaw-Howard University and U Street-Cardozo stations would be used by 18,100 and 15,100 people each day, respectively. Ward 1 anticipates full funding, construction and completion of the Columbia Heights and Georgia Avenue Metro stations q) The overall transportation goal for the District is to provide a transportation system that meets the needs of its residents, employees, and visitors and ensures the effective functioning of the District. 81 ENROLLED ORIGINAL "SEC. 1200.114.

WARD 1 URBAN DESIGN BACKGROUND. W’(a) Ward 1 is an old part of the city with strong architectural character. Structures and design elements date to the late 19th and the early 20th centuries. The predominately low skyline is punctuated with spires, pediments, turrets, mansards, and richly carved cornices, all of which recall "period" architectural styles. Other building design elements include bay or oriel windows, carved limestone lintels, arched openings, English basements, tiled vestibules, and leaded and stained glass transoms. Large residential, commercial, and public buildings generally have limestone facades with metal or slate roofs. Smaller apartments and rowhouses consist of masonry with limestone and pressed metal detailing. Brick is the predominant building material for the Ward b) Architectural style and form differ from one major artery to the next. Connecticut Avenue has a full range of architectural styles dating from the early 1900’s to the 1970’s. Sixteenth Street, the former "Street of Embassies displays the grandest of styles Palaces" and stately chanceries are found in great abundance. Fourteenth Street, historically the commercial strip for the area, is now a Development Opportunity Area characterized by vacant or boarded parcels awaiting development, new mid-rise apartments, public buildings built since the 1968 civil disturbances, and older rehabilitated apartment buildings. Lower Georgia Avenue’s predominant character is defined by the campus of tIoward University to the west, north, and south c) Eighteenth Street and Columbia Road are particularly expressive of a strong multi-ethnic, historic, and urban character. The festive ambience of both streets created by antique shops, art galleries, boutiques, ethnic restaurants, largely in restored turn-of-the-century buildings, and the cultural kaleidoscope of the area should be preserved d) U Street, the major east-west artery, and one of the former cultural centers of the Black community, today contains both rehabilitated and deteriorating buildings. Major changes are anticipated now that the U Street-Cordozo and Shaw-Howard University Metrorail stations and other major developments are completed. Residential uses between the arteries are characterized predominantly by masonry 3 and 4 story rowhouses and apartment buildings e) Urban design guidelines for Ward 1 should cover major portions of the ward, including 1) Shaw School Urban Renewal Area 2) 14th Street Urban Renewal Area 3) Metro Station Impact Area; 88 ENROLLED ORIGINAL 4 5 6 7 8 9 I0) LeDroit Park Historic District; 16th Street Historic District; Mount Pleasant Historic District; Striver’s Row Itistoric District; Massachusetts Avenue Historic District; Howard University Master Plan; Individual landmark buildings and special streets, including 16th Street, Vermont Avenue, New Hampshire, Florida and Georgia Avenues 11 12 13 14 15 16) Kalorama Triangle Historic District; Woodley Park Historic District; Sheridan-Kalorama Historic District; 18th Street and Columbia Road; Riggs-Tivoli area; and 14th Street and U Street corridors SEC. 1200.122.

ACTIONS TO IMPLEMENT URBAN DESIGN OBJECTIVES The actions to implement urban design objectives are as follows 1) To determine appropriate height, bulk, density, and building materials so that new structures are designed to be harmonous with their surroundings by A) Developing a voluntary system of covenants requiring design review and guidelines for facade design and signage in commercial areas B) Reevaluating urban design standards in urban renewal plans in order to better ensure the appropriate design of new development on specific renewal sites C) Developing design standards to guide the District’s review of development proposals for Washington Metropolitan Area Transit Authority owned sites and other sites; and r’(D) Considering changes in the Zoning Regulations as necessary to make new development compatible with existing buildings in areas where rehabilitation or moderate density development goals are primary neighborhood goals, such as Sheridan-Kalorama, Woodley Park, Adams Morgan, Mount Pleasant, the S to U Streets area, the 16th Street area, Columbia Heights, and LeDroit Park 2) To eliminate unsightly billboards and provide better control of signage by A) Amending sign regulations to improve placement and size of signs B) Restricting signs by size and content above the ground floor level in mixed-use districts; and C) Requiring design review of all Urban Renewal projects development plans 3) To develop better control over the commercial use of public space so as to improve visual appearances, prevent distractions from the enjoyment of public space, reduce pedestrian congestion on the sidewalks, and increase the visual enjoyment of public space by A) Amending the laws and regulations on sidewalk cafes to discourage enclosed sidewalk cafes and to provide better standards for location and design of sidewalk cafes generally; and 90 ,NP, OLLI D ORIf INAL B) Amending the current vending regulations as they pertain to appropriate widths of sidewalks to reduce congestion on sidewalks 4) To conduct a special study of current design requirements for private and public development, undertaking streetscape studies to include such areas as 18th and Columbia Road, Mount Pleasant Street, U Street, 14th Street, 18th Street between S Street and Florida Avenue, Connecticut Avenue between Columbia Road and Florida Avenue, and Georgia Avenue 5) To increase and retain street trees in residential and commercial areas in Ward 1 by A) Encouraging developers to plant and maintain trees in the public spaces adjoining develop[nents, including such places as the 14th and U Street corridors, 7th Street and Florida Avenue, and Reed-Cooke and other areas in Adams Morgan B) Keeping treewells planted with trees, preventing owners from removing treewells; and C) Developing a plan to plant and maintain street trees throughout the ward with particular attention to 16th and U Streets, 14th Street and Park l~oad, the median strip of Sherman Avenue, 18th Street and Columbia Road, 14th Street and Park Road, 18th Street between S Street and Columbia Road, Georgia Avenue, 14th Street, U Street, Mount Pleasant Street and the 3200 to 3400 blocks of llth Street; and 6) To beautify streetscapes and widen sidewalks by A) Widening sidewalks at 14th Street near Park Road, 1300 and 1400 blocks of Park Road, 16th and U Streets, 18th Street, and Columbia Road B) l~eplanting and improving the median strip on Sherman Avenue; and C) Considering the possibility of providing a median strip along Calvert Street between the Duke Ellington Bridge and Adams Mill l~oad SEC. 1200.125. WARD 1 PI~ESEI~VATION AND HISTORIC FEATURES a) Ward 1, which lies just within and beyond the Old Federal City boundary, represents an important part of the District’s architectural and cultural history. At the end of the 19th century, major corridors, such as Connecticut Avenue, 16th Street, and Columbia l~oad, were lined with mansions and nearby neighborhoods, such as Mount Pleasant, Kalorama, and LeDroit Park, located in many instances along streetcar lines, were being developed rapidly as prestigious suburban enclaves b) Natural features contributed. The escarpment lying between the old and new cities meant that the areas being rapidly developed to the north were felt to have healthier, and in summertime, cooler air. Meridian Hill, Thomas Jefferson’s Meridian point, pinpoints the view down 16th Street (the Avenue of Presidents) to the White House. The two major landmark bridges, linking the developing city east and west across l~ock Creek Park, were built in the early 20th century c) The area is rich in cultural history as a home to famous national figures, presidents, Supreme Court justices, congressmen. The LeDroit Park, U Street, and other midcity areas are a major focus for 91 black cultural history. Early black scholars, writers and artists performed, worked, and lived here in the days of segregation. Howard University was established to provide high quality education for blacks and became an important seat of learning for black scholars and professors precluded from research and teaching in "white" institutions. A new memorial honoring African American veterans of the Civil War and their white officers, to be located at the i0th and U Street Metro stop, and a related genealogical research or "heritage" center, to be located at Garnet-Patterson School, will become a focal point for this historically significant area d) Today some of this history has been recognized through the designation of historic districts and landmarks. The districts include: LeDroit Park, Kalorama Triangle, Massachusetts Avenue, Sheridan-Kalorama, Woodley Park, 16th Street, Strivers Row, and Mount Pleasant. Additional areas and sites are being studied for possible designation e) The District of Columbia Preservation Law in conjunction with federal law affords substantial protection to designated landmarks and areas. Nonetheless, development pressures and land use processes such as the l~edevelopment Land Agency I~LA and the Zoning Commission do not work in harmony, at least all the time, with the basic purposes of the preservation laws SEC. 1200.126. WARD 1 OBJECTIVES FOR PRESERVATION AND HISTORICAL FEATURES The objectives for preservation and historical features are to preserve the important historic features of Ward 1 while permitting new development that is compatible with those features SEC. 1200. 127. WARD 1 POLICIES IN SUPPORT OF PRESERVATION AND HISTORIC FEATURES OBJECTIVES The policies in support of preservation and historic features objectives are as follows 1) To protect and enhance the important historic resources of Ward 1 and the national napital 2) To provide sufficient administrative flexibility throughout Ward 1 in building codes and other related codes and regulations to permit maximum preservation and protection of historic resources while still ensuring the health and safety of the public 3) To adopt in Ward 1 development controls and design review criteria that, for particular districts in the ward, reflect the existing, valuable characteristics of the particular historic district or portion thereof; and 4) To ensure that historic buildings in Ward 1 whose significance is embodied in their sites and settings, as well as i the buildings themselves, are physically moved only when there is no feasible alternative for preservation. If an historic building must be moved, its new setting should complement its historic orientation and previous sense of place and integrity. If the relocated building is established on a new site that itself possesses historic significance, its presence should not adversely affect the significance of the new location. 92 ENROLLEO ORiGiNAL "SEC. 1200.128. ACTIONS TO IMPLEMENT PRESERVATION AND HISTORIC FEATURES The actions to implement preservation and historic features are as follows 1) To designate meritorious structures and areas within Ward 1 as historic landmarks and districts and encourage the retention of existing historic and architecturally significant structures by A) Surveying potential landmarks and historic areas in Ward 1 B) Developing historic preservation guidelines for use with historic districts and historic landmarks to govern the physical design, public space, alterations, and redevelopment and to ensure that new developments are compatible with the character of individual buildings and districts C) Surveying and recommending for listing potential historic preservation areas in the ward as desirable landmarks or historic districts, as appropriate, such as 13th Street, the west side of Florida Avenue from Connecticut Avenue to Massachusetts Avenue, and portions of other neighborhoods; and D) Considering the possibilitiy of designating certain new, or expanding certain exiting historic districts, including Connecticut Avenue Historic District (from Florida Avenue to Calvert Street the Strivers Row/Midway District, LeDroit Park Historic District (several blocks the Kalorama Historic District to include Walter C. Pierce Park, and the 16th Street Historic District (northward from U Street to Spring Road 2) To strengthen historic preservation laws and regulations, as well as related laws and regulations, and enforce more strongly existing laws by A) Amending laws to extend to historic districts the protection afforded proposed historic landmarks from the moment the application on a historic district is filed B) Portraying historic districts on updated maps and considering historic district zoning C) Amending the administrative procedures and notice requirements of the Historic Preservation tteview Board to be compatible with those of the Zoning Commission on all actions taken through the Board; and D) Enforcing existing laws prohibiting demolitions and alterations of exteriors of historically designated areas, districts, and individual properties without approval process through the Preservation Review Board 3) To protect the L’Enfant Plan city and environs by A) Protecting Meridian Hill/Malcolm X Park (Thomas Jefferson’s established meridian point and planned area of view from that point to the White House) and the area around it through zoning and historic preservation; and B) Providing vista and height limitation within the L’Enfant Boundaries and for the escarpment at the edge of these boundaries 4) To provide adaptive reuse and rehabilitation for many structures in commercial districts of Ward I suitable for adaptive reuse and rehabilitation by: 93 ENROLLED ORIGINAL A) Encouraging use of programs which are of assistance in encouraging rehabilitation of properties, such as tax credits and facade easements; and B) Providing information to business people about programs such as business loans offered through the federal or District governments; vw(5) To restore, protect, and maintain landmark public facilities in Ward 1, restoring the landmark Taft and Ellington Bridges to their original form, including removal of the barriers recently installed on the Ellington Bridge; and 6) To prevent demolition by neglect of historic landmarks or contributing buildings in historic districts by applying existing programs and creating additional legislative remedies SEC. 1200.129. WARD 1 LAND USE a) Ward 1 has 1,219 acres of land, about 4~ of the total land area of the District. The ward is geographically small and has less vacant land than any of the other wards. Population is about the same as the other wards, indicating that population density is much greater in Ward 1 than in the other wards that have more land b) Land use in Ward 1 is primarily residential, with the predominant pattern that of rowhouses, about 49~ of the total residential land area. These houses are virtually all of masonry construction and of good quality. Very little housing is single family detached and semi-detached housing, only about 18.8 and it is concentrated largely in the Sheridan-Kalorama area of the ward. The remainder of residential land use is low-rise, mid-rise, and medium-rise multi-family apartment houses. Not infrequently the residential land use pattern involves a mix of rowhouses and low-rise to medium-rise apartment buildings within the same block face. Many of these residential areas west of 14th street are zoned as apartment house density when, in fact, the predominant block face pattern is that of rowhouses. This represents a major problem for the ward, as do inadequate zoning controls and lax enforcement, resulting in non-residential uses usurping residential uses in residentially zoned areas c) The commercial areas of the ward tend to be strip-zoned, small business areas with little space for parking or loading, and are usually adjacent to residential neighborhoods. They amount to 14% of the total land, a substantial land allocation by comparison with other wards, and have the potential for considerable business development. They are fairly evenly distributed throughout the ward and therefore afford good access to local residents. Retail services needed by local residents are provided unevenly, however, especially in the areas to the east of 16th Street and along Mount Pleasant Street. Considerable economic activity, largely retail and restuarant, is present in the 18th Street and Columbia Road and Connecticut Avenue/Woodley Park areas, but essential and needed services may be replaced by other commercial uses bringing a greater financial return on investment. A major concern in the ward is that of retaining services needed by residents where they are provided and providing needed services where they are lacking d) Commercial areas, such as U Street, 18th Street and Columbia Road, and Mount Pleasant Street, contain housing, usually combined with commercial uses, in rowhouses, restored fire stations, or warehouses, 94 ENROLLED ORIGINAL or in apartment houses. The housing is desirable, but there is a tendency to replace it with other uses. Because of this housing, and the proximity of residentially zoned areas, the makeup of commercial districts should be compatible with residential communities. w(e) Industrial land occupies less than 14 of the land and is characterized by small pockets of land containing a hodge-podge of residences and commercial and industrial buildings. Most of this land is not now used for industrial purposes, but rather as commercial/retail and housing. Many of these areas contain deteriorated structures and vacant land. As these areas increasingly become a focus for redevelopment, the housing and some desirable small businesses within these areas may be lost unless provided for in revised zoning. Where they are adjacent to Howard University, these areas have become the focus of a revised campus plan. Most Ward 1 industrial areas have been rezoned in recent years. v~(f) A major goal of the ward continues to be the revitilization of the 14th and U Street corridors and neighboring communities. The situation is complicated by the combined realities of WMATA parcels, RLA plan and parcels, possible large scale public/private development consortiums, and the complicated land use mix of zones and uses, vacant and developed land, good housing stock, interesting warehouses, and outmoded structures. A carefully coordinated plan and strategy has yet to be developed which would encourage redevelopment that will not be at the expense of displacement of desirable small businesses and low-scale housing units, and which will assure that the character and density of residential neighborhoods adjacent to these corridors, as well as historic landmarks and districts, will be protected W(g) Areas that have undergone considerable review include the Reed-Cooke area of Adams Morgan, involving the rezoning of a.mixed-use industrial area, and the area to the immediate west of Howard University, which will become part of a greater Howard University planned development, and the 14th and U Street corridors. Zoning cases are anticipated to provide additional protection for rowhouses areas h) In a ward of high land use and population density, parks and open spaces occupy only 134 of the land as compared with an average of 20.54 for the city as a whole. At the same time, the ward has some 31.24 of its land in right-of-ways, second only to Ward 2. With the smallest amount of undeveloped land, about two-thirds of the ward’s 4.44 private undeveloped land is located in the Shaw and 14th Street Urban Renewal Areas. Additionally, the ward has a higher concentration than most wards (concentrated in a smaller geographical area) of community residence facilities; a more equal distribution citywide is desirable. There is not much leeway for solving land use problems when these considerations are taken into account, so selective rezonings to more desirable uses of land or to improve protection of existing land use patterns is desirable. Density in areas where density is substantial already, such as the 14th Street corridor, should not be increased beyond moderate density, and additional recreation space, open space, and parks are needed. u(i) The ward has much land allocated to historic landmarks and historic districts, which in turn are mapped where there is little vacant land. The bulk of the land covered by these districts and landmarks is ENROLLED ORIGINAL residential. It is important that land use regulation recognize the importance of conserving these areas SEC. 1200.130.

WARD 2 ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT a) Ward 2 is located in the northwest and southwest quadrants of the city and is generally bounded by North and South Capitol streets on the east, the Potomac River on the south and west (the District boundary actually extends to the Virginia shore Whitehaven Parkway on the west and a line extending generally along Whitehaven Parkway, Florida Avenue, N.W and S Street, N.W on the north. The continuing expansion of the city’s economy, in terms of lobs, business development opportunities and tax revenues, is a high priority for the District government. Major efforts are underway to increase economic development throughout the city, especially in outlying commercial centers. Ward 2 is, in almost all respects, the economic engine of the city. As the center of the city and region, employment in Ward 2 is greater than in the other 7 wards b) The average number of lobs in the city in 1986 was 672,300. Over half of this total is estimated to be in Ward 2. In addition, there are probably another 30,000 employees in the self -employed and international agency categories. Many of these people also work in Ward 2. The greatest amount of development activity is concentrated in Ward 2, as described in the land use section. Major development took place in the 1980’s in the Downtown area between the Capitol and the White House, with significant development also taking place in the Connecticut Avenue and K Street area and the West End. Recent development (1990-93) has been limited due to economic conditions. Development is moving eastward and future development will take place in the Ward 2 portion of Buzzard Point/Near Southeast c) Most of the future employment growth will be in office employment. Ward 2 has traditionally been the location of the "three A’s attorneys, accountants, and associations) that make up much of the District’s private sector employment. New lobs are being created in communications, finance, and "high-tech" sales. Jobs in the hospitality industry, especially hotel related lobs, are also increasing d) The employment structure in any dynamic city is constantly changing. The District’s employment growth strategy must seek to retain 104 F.HROLLEO ORIGINAL and increase existing jobs while also seeking to attract new types of jobs. Employment in the city, and in Ward 2, is growing fastest in the private sector e) However, it is important to retain and increase federal jobs in Ward 2. Development of the Federal Triangle Project is important to retain federal agency jobs f) In 1990, 83 percent of employed Ward 2 residents worked in the city, the highest percentage of any ward. Citywide, about 78 percent of employed residents worked in the city. One of the great advantages of living in Ward 2 is the proximity to work; most Ward 2 residents also work in Ward 2. Many Ward 2 residents can walk to work or have only a short commute by public transit. These Ward 2 residential communities need to be kept healthy and vibrant as this unique residential character in Ward 2 enhances the Central Business District g) The skill level of Ward 2 residents is not fully matched with the jobs available. In 1990, 554 of all employed residents in the ward were in managerial, professional, or technical occupations. This percentage is continuing to increase as new residents move into the ward to be near the growing office employment in the Central Employment Area. On the other hand, 1990 census data indicated that 214 of the ward’s population was in poverty. These residents have low-paying jobs or are unemployed. It is important to create entry-level jobs, such as those found in the hospitality industry. Adult education and job training programs are needed to allow these residents to move up the employment ladder. A new system of welfare needs to be investigated, and where appropriate, implemented, where there are jobs tied with welfare payments (’workfare h) The improvement of neighborhood and community commercial areas has several economic development implications, l~etail stores and services are an amenity that help retain and attract residents to Ward 2. To a large extent, Ward 2 residents are a captive market, and will usually buy groceries and other daily necessities in the neighborhood, thus retaining purchasing power in the community. Finally, neighborhood stores and services provide employment to Ward 2 and other District residents SEC. 1200. 202. WAleD 2 OBJECTIVES FOI~ ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT The objectives for economic development are as follows 1) Enhance the image of Ward 2 as a place to do business and to reside 2) Maintain sound areas of the ward and rebuild and develop other areas of the ward where economic development actions are needed 3) Increase total employment in the ward, especially in the Central Employment Area, and at appropriate locations and levels in other areas of the ward 4) Increase employment for District residents, especially Ward 2 residents, within the Ward 2 employment base 5) Spur growth of the "visitor industry" by attracting additional visitors of all types and increasing their average length of stay in Washington and by constructing a new convention center on the six squares north of Mount Vernon Square; 105 ENROLLED ORIGINAL 6) ]~etain existing businesses and develop new businesses, with special emphasis on small and minority business development; businesses located out of Downtown should be compatible with the needs of adjacent residential neighborhoods where appropriate, encourage mixed-use residential and commercial uses 7) Utilize the potential of the District’s universities, especially in Ward 2, as well as existing and future museums, galleries, theaters and other cultural facilities, to create an expanded center of knowledge and learning in the center of Washington; and 8) Increase District tax revenues from expanded economic development activity in Ward 2 but not at the expense of residential communities in the Nard that are critical providers of revenues to the District, especially in the form of income and property taxess, and that are a source of employees to the Central Employment Area SEC. 1200.203. WAleD 2 ACTIONS IN SUPPOI~T OF ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT The actions in support of economic development are as follows 1) Focus special economic development programs in non-residential areas 2) Establish a policy framework for development of Buzzard Point/Near Southeast 3) Encourage office employment growth outside residential use areas, in new development in Downtown, in other areas of the Central Employment Area, and in other Development Opportunity Areas 4) Increase employment in traditional public and private sector office lobs and in new types of lobs in communications, information industries, and high-technology sales and research; special efforts are needed to increase lobs in the Central Employment Area in the face of suburban competition as follows A) Continue to implement the Downtown Plan, including strengthening arrangements for Downtown coordination and cooperation and ecouraging development in other parts of the Central Employment Area B) Work with the National Capital Planning Commission (NCPC) and the General Service Administration (GSA) to increase federal employment in the ward and near the Central Employment Area; and C) l~equire the Office of Business and Economic Development (OBED) to work with local universities, community development corporations, other community groups, and university/non-profit organization/private sector business partnerships to create economic development programs 5) Encourage new retail employment in the Central Employment area, especially in Downtown 6 Achieve, where appropriate, retail and service development and encourage cottage industries at the neighborhood commercial areas of the ward outside the Central Employment Area, while respecting the scale and needs of the adjacent neighborhoods by A) Taking actions to capitalize on economic opportunities near new Metrorail stations outside the Central Employment Area, including Mount Vernon Square/UDC, Shaw/Howard University, and Waterfront stations; 106 ENROLLED ORIGINAL B) Requiring the Office of Business and Economic Development (OBED) to target special programs to improve neighborhood and community shopping areas, including 17th Street, N.W 14th Street, N.W Seventh Street, N.W and Waterside Mall C) Working with private owners to find ways to develop permanent parking structures, where possible and appropriate, for neighborhood and community commercial areas and promoting "shared parking" between day time and night time users, where appropriate 7) Increase the promotion of the ward’s and the city’s hospitality industry to attract additional visitors and to provide additional visitor amenities and services by A) Continuing to work with the Convention Center Board to build a new convention center on the 6 squares north of Mount Vernon Square and to improve the existing convention center; and B) Working with the hospitality industry to provide information on lesser known points of interest in Ward 2 8) Make special efforts to retain existing businesses and to attract new businesses, especially small and minority-owned businesses; the Minority Business Opportunity Commission (MBOC) and OBED shall continue to increase programs to return and attract small and minority businesses to Downtown and other sections of the Central Employment Area by identifying locations in neighborhood retail centers where there are small and minority business opportunities, and providing special assistance and support if required; and 9) Expedite the rezoning of the area designated in the high-density commercial category for the area south of Massachusetts Avenue in the Central Employment Area (CEA) in order to encourage retention and expansion of non-profit and national trade associations SEC. 1200.204. WARD 2 HOUSING a) Changes in the ward’s housing stock during the last several years reflect city-wide trends. Perhaps no other ward in the city has such a diverse housing stock as Ward 2. Restoration in Dupont Circle, Logan Circle, and now Shaw has helped these neighborhoods regain much of their past prominence. They are close to Downtown, Connecticut Avenue, and K Street and are well served by mass transit. Much of the neighborhoods’ attraction lies in the beauty of their urbane architecture and tree-lined streets. They are also long lasting reminders of the city’s growth from L’Enfant’s original plan to today’s international city b) Equally interesting are the Foggy Bottom and Georgetown neighborhoods. Both once contained industrial areas and included gas works, glass companies, breweries, and warehouses. Most of these buildings are gone, removed to make way for the later office, retail, and residential development. Foggy Bottom is a mix of old alley houses, such as those on Snows Court and Hughes Mews, townhouses, mid-rise apartments and condominiums as well as the headquarters of the Department of State. Georgetown, too, has retained much of its historic housing, with quaint alley dwellings and beautifully restored rowhouses c) Southwest is one of the city’s more contemporary neighborhoods. Developed from a massive early 1950’s urban renewal program, the Southwest housing stock combines garden apartments, townhouses and high-rise apartments. A popular place for young singles 107 ENROLLED ORIGINAL and families, Southwest offers an attractive waterfront and green open space as well as the city’s open-air seafood market d) But even with the success of restoration and new housing development, there are still housing problems. The ward has a large number of public housing units in the Southwest and the central northwast sections of the ward. Unfortunately, many of these units are in disrepair and are overcrowded. Housing for the elderly is in short supply. Many private apartments are being renovated and returned to the housing stock as upscale rental units or condominiums e) Abandoned units, particularly in the 14th Street, lower Logan Circle, and Shaw neighborhoods cause serious problems. Not only do they contribute to the shortage of affordable housing and are neighborhood eyesores, they are often havens for drug addicts and other illegal activity. The city needs to investigate a severe "use tax" to encourage the rehabilitation of private property to spur neighborhood redevelopment. Neighborhood organizations representing the Shaw Area often complain about the displacement of elderly and low-moderate income persons by renovation activities. Residents of ~’oggy Bottom, Georgetown, Dupont Circle, and Southwest note rising housing costs and tax assessments as problems. ’(f) Even with these problems, the ward’s housing stock continues to improve. The Department of Public and Assisted Housing (’DPAH’) has programmed large-scale renovations for the ward’s public housing stock. Among those units that have been upgraded or are proposed for improvements are Syphax, James Creek, and Greenleaf. One Greenleaf high rise building was renovated as housing for the elderly. Various programs are available through DPAH to assist low- and moderate-income families in renting or purchasing units. The District has made a commitment to retain its publicly owned housing inventory intact, making improvements and alleviating the lack of affordable low-income housing g) Institutional growth, commercial expansion, and rising housing costs have had negative impacts on t~oggy Bottom and West End neighborhoods. The Comprehensive Plan and its requirement for updated campus master plans will help limit non-residential growth that had begun to diminish the neighborhoods1 housing stock. Opening of the Shaw-Howard University Metrorail Station at Seventh and 1~ Streets, N.W has helped to spark renewed interest in this neighborhood. l~estoration has begun to revitalize the housing stock. Developers are including housing in concepts for creating a new environment at Mr. Vernon Square h) The Waterfront Metrorail Station connects Downtown with Southwest. The vast acreage in Buzzard Point south of P Street, S.W has development potential I(i) Now there is a new impetus to develop Buzzard Point/Near Southeast. Concept plans include mixed office, retail, recreational, and residential space. Successful development, over the next 30 years or more, will be a major step in the revitalization of this key area of the city j) The Comprehensive Plan designated Mr. Vernon Square, Market Square (now called Pennsylvania Quarter Greenleaf Gardens, and James Creek as Housing Opportunity Areas. A Housing Opportunity Area is one in which the District encourages new or renovated housing through public-private partnerships or other means. 108 ENROLLED ORIGINAL k) Major progress has been made in creating a new residential neighborhood in Pennsylvania Quarter. Three private developments (the Lansburgh, Market Square, and the Pennsylvanian developed under the auspices of the Pennsylvania Avenue Development Corporation, have a total of 745 units 1) With renovation underway in Shaw and the potential for housing in Downtown and Buzzard Point/Near Southeast, the ward’s housing stock should see a period of growth during the next five to 10 years. But perhaps more importantly, the District is committed to providing funds to help low- and moderate-income families continue to reside in Ward 2 and thereby retain its ethnic and economic diversity SEC. 1200.205. WARD 2 OBJECTIVES I~OR HOUSING The objectives for housing are as follows 1) Stimulate production of new and rehabilitated housing to meet all levels of need and demand and to provide incentives for the types of housing needed at desired locations 2 Provide for the housing needs of low- and moderate-income households 3) Improve the low-rent housing program 4) Encourage home ownership 5) Reduce the overall cost of housing among low- and moderate-income households; and 6) Provide regulatory, enforcement, and financial programs to protect, maintain, and enhance the District’s housing supply and to strengthen private and public neighborhood services and facilities to support the District’s housing programs SEC. 1200.206. WARD 2 ACTIONS IN SUPPORT OF HOUSING OBJECTIVES The actions in support of housing objectives are as follows 1) The District government shall encourage the private sector to provide new housing to meet the needs of present and future District residents at locations consistent with District land-use policies and objectives 2) The District government shall recognize the importance of the lending industry in housing development, identify sites where new housing is to be encouraged, and, in selected cases, provide incentives for desired development. Incorporate strategies to encourage the lending industry to curtail "red-lining" in Ward 2 areas targeted for housing development. Education and incentives should be used to forge cooperative relationships with local lending institutions 3) The government shall also review and recommend suitable regulatory, zoning, tax and financing incentives under appropriate controls to meet housing production goals, particularly for low- and moderate-income and elderly households, with an emphasis placed on reducing regulations and easing the permit process for housing dwellings of three 3 or fewer units 4) The District government shall work with owners and community groups to identify vacant housing units suitable for rehabilitation to make restoration of vacant housing units a major government priority. The Department of Housing and Community 109 ENROLLED ORIGINAL Development shall accelerate the return of abandoned buildings to the active residential real estate market 5) The District government shall establish, as a matter of major governmental priority, the production of housing, including low- and moderate-income households in Ward 2, particularly Downtown by A) Exploring the economic feasibility of housing incentives such as tax incentives and land cost right down to encouraging housing in the Downtown area; and B) Encouraging the inclusion of housing units in appropriate locations in all commercial areas with particular incentives for the central city at designated mixed-use areas and at Metrorail stops 6) In order to maintain the City’s housing supply, the Department of Housing and Community Development DHCD shall expedite review of reported use-violations of residential properties in the Southwest Urban l~enewal Area quickly issue cease and desist orders as indicated, and, as a final step in enforcement, take to Court those who do not conform to the Plan. DHCD has this responsibility. Flagrant abuse of the Plan has led to parking, traffic, and trespassing problems, as well as a reduction in the number of residential units available for citizen housing 7} The ward has a high percentage of older units in its housing stock. These units must be made more energy-efficient in relation to home maintenance costs. The Building Code Advisory Commission should continue to update the codes as necessary, incorporating energy considerations for new and rehabilitated housing construction. The D.C. Energy Office shall continue to publicize programs for home energy conservation 8) The District government shall improve neighborhood-level commercial services throughout the ward while at the same time protecting residential neighborhoods from disruptive uses, promote public/private business partnerships through OBED and other programs to support small neighborhood businesses, implement OBED’s Neighborhood Commercial l~evitalization Program concepts in the 14th Street and 7th Street corridors, and implement an education program for merchants to aid them in improving promotion and management of neighborhood commercial services 9) The District government shall increase new construction and maintenance of rental housing and increase enforcement of housing codes in the ward. The city, in conjunction with non-profit organizations and private investors, shall explore ways of increasing the supply of rental housing. The Department of Consumer and ttegulatory Affairs (’DCttA’) shall expand housing code violation enforcement procedures and develop methods of penalizing property owners who are chronic offenders 10) An important element causing housing problems has been the demolition and conversion of housing to provide commercial and institutional buildings, university dormitories, offices, classroom space, hotels, and medical clinics. In addition, current zoning regulations permit the conversion of housing stock in residential neighborhoods to medical clinics and doctors’ offices. To improve the housing stock and to prevent further loss of housing through replacement of residential housing by the construction of housing that is for other than genuinely residential purposes, adjustments shall be made to existing zoning 110 ENROLLEO ORIGINAL regulations and to campus plans. In addition, the current policy allowing community based residential facilities to be overconcentrated in mixed-use zones causes the severe decline of residential neighborhoods within and adjacent to the mixed-use zones SEC. 1200.207. WARD 2 ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION a) Environmental protection has taken on national importance during the last 15 years. Research has identified specific correlations between the quality of the environment and health. The aging process, work productivity, and mental health are among many aspects of life affected by changes in environmental quality b) Ward 2 has a variety of urban environmental conditions. Many of the ward’s environmental problems are the result of its land use activity pattern. The ward is the center of the metropolitan region’s employment, retail, and tourist areas. It is also the city’s transit hub. The confluence of the Potomac and Anacostia rivers is at the southern end of the ward c) Due to the daily influx of vehicles in the ward buses, taxis, cars, and trucks exhaust emissions are a major problem, particularly in Downtown and other employment and retail areas. Poor air quality has had a negative effect on street trees and contributes to deterioration of buildings and monuments, as well as to the public health d) The ward’s concentrated residential population, its large work force, and its year-round tourism result in the generation of a large amount of waste e) Noise pollution is often associated with the numerous construction sites in Downtown, West End, and Southwest. In addition, noise results from traffic and emergency vehicles and air traffic for National Airport f) The Environmental Protection Element of the Comprehensive Plan addresses the need to alleviate the adverse effects of poor environmental quality. The element contains policies directed toward improving air quality, developing safe solid waste, sludge disposal, and enforcing public health and sanitation standards. Various District government agencies such as the Department of Public Works DPW and the Department of Consumer and Regulatory Affairs DCRA are already implementing programs to improve the city’s environmental quality. The Metropolitan Washington Council of Governments (COG) interacts with local jurisdictions to improve the region’s environmental quality g) The District, Prince Georges County, Maryland, and federal governments have entered into a partnership to cleanup the Anacostia River. The river is in poor condition, with sediment and high bacteria levels making it virtually uninhabitable for aquatic life h) A computerized sewage swirl concentrator has been constructed just east of D.C. General Hospital. However, without the combined efforts of the government and area residents, the Anacostia will continue to deteriorate i) The Potomac River has been improved. Fish and plant life have made a remarkable recovery and, according to a recent Council of Government report, some sections of the river are nearly suitable for swimming. Pollution levels in the river are the lowest in several decades. 111 EHROLLED ORIGIHAL The dramatic recover of the Potomac is the result of the combined efforts of local and federal governments and area residents j) Conditions along the shorelines, however, need improvement. The Potomac shoreline from Key Bridge to Fort Leslie J. McNair has benefitted from recent developments, but the Anacostia shoreline has not received similar attention. From Buzzard Point to the Navy Yard, the Anacostia west bank is in need of improvement. Seawalls are required to secure the shoreline against erosion. Walkways, lights, benches, picnic areas, and marinas would make this section of the Anacostia an attractive addition to this city’s waterfront k) There is a new commitment to upgrade the quality of the District’s environment. With recovery of the Potomac River and other similar efforts, a new era of environmental improvement is beginning for the Anacostia. Proposals for both shorelines are heightening the need for better management of the city’s waterfronts. The District, like other large cities, is implementing new technology for solid waste disposal. Regular and bulk trash pickup schedules have been improved, lessening debris in the ward’s neighborhoods. In addition, the city’s 20-year storm water abatement plan is underway. The Swirl Concentrator will reduce pollution levels in the Anacostia while helping reduce the volume of waste treated at Blue Plains SEC. 1200.208. WARD 2 OBJECTIVES FOR ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION The objectives for environmental protection are as follows 1) Improve the quality of water in the rivers and streams of the District to meet public health and water quality standards, and maintain physical, chemical, and biological integrity of these watercourses for multiple uses, including recreation 2) Improve the quality of the air of the District and its region so as to meet public health standards 3) Protect the overall environmental quality of the District’s land areas by preventing further soil erosion, promoting the restoration of eroded areas, and enforcing prohibitions against illegal dumping and other destructive practices 4) Improve and develop safe and effective methods of collection, management, and disposal of solid waste and sewage sludge 5) Promote water conservation in order to ensure adequate supplies of potable water at all times and reduce discharges into the rivers; and 6) Continue to support DPW’s upgrade of its street tree maintenance program SEC. 1200. 209. WARD 2 ACTIONS IN SUPPORT OF ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION OBJECTIVES The actions in support of environmental protection are as follows i) Combta pollution of the Potomac and Anacostia rivers these pollution of rivers continues to be a major environmental concern in the ward by A) Continuing support of regional and interstate efforts to limit upstream pollution from sewage, construction, and agricultural uses; 112 ENROLLED ORIGINAL B) Improving regulation of houseboats and other floating structures in the Washington Channel Marina to reduce water pollution C) Encouraging the National Park Service to rebuild riverbanks to stop erosion adjacent to Rock Creek and West Potomac Parks D) Cleanubg up industrial areas of the Anacostia West Bank, as well as cleaning up the Maine Avenue Fish Market, requiring frequent trash removal, regrading and repaving right-of-way parking and loading areas E) Encouraging the National Park Service to adopt programs for removal of trash accumulations on tidal flats adjacent to East Potomac Park F) Supporting research on positive and negative effects of hydrilla in the Potomac to satisfy conflicting public concerns G) Requiring that public space in new waterfront development be maintained contiguously along shorelines H) Working with the National Park Service to develop a water recreation center on the Anacostia’s West Bank below the Navy Yard similar to Thompson’s Boat House on the Potomac; and I) Urging the Recreation Advisory Board to create a subcommittee for waterfront recreation 2) Reduce trash and litter in outdoor spaces throughout the ward by A) Urging DPW to increase weekend trash pick-ups in congested areas B) Requiring enforceable requirements for an exterior trash removal plan as part of the business of licensing of carry out/fast food/convenience stores C) Addressing problems of dumpsters located in public space or parking areas through enforcement of existing regulations; there shall be no dumpsters located in public space fronting a building where there is an alley access, and there shall be no dumpsters located on major pedestrian walk areas D) Encouraging Advisory Neighborhood Commissions ANC to develop and announce neighborhood clean-up campaigns in conjunction with the special city trash removal schedule E) Establishing a routine and adequate city trash clean-up program for grounds and public spaces in vacant public housing projects and other city-owned property; and F) Requiring DCRA to require that applicants for demolition permits submit plans for cleanup, ground cover, fencing/screening, and trash removal; all vacant lots resulting from demolition activities shall be fenced and secured and the DCl~A shall require the fencing to be maintained 3) Reduce air pollution in the ward 4) Address causes of noise pollution in the ward by A) Working with the Metropolitan Washington Airports Authority to improve airport operations and reduce noise, especially in Ward 2 B) Working with Washington Metropolitan Area Transit Authority WMATA to reduce bus noise for new buses, especially during acceleration; 113 ENROI.i.ED ORIf INM C) Enforcing the prohibition on operations of intercity buses (including charter tour buses) on all city streets other than arterials and prohibiting parking or standing with motor running except while boarding or debusing passengers D) Enforcing noise limits for operations of trucks within the city, including city-owned trucks, refuse trucks, and cement trucks E) Requiring DCRA to enforce restrictions on the operation of construction equipment and any other noise-generating on-site activities through ].imitations on building permits to limit the hours of construction to between 7 a.m. and 5 p.m. weekdays at any location in or within 500 feet of a predominantly residential building or a residentially zoned district and by prohibiting construction operations within 500 feet of residential areas on Sundays F) Prohibiting installation or use of burglar alarms on buildings and in cars that generate an audible signal for more than 15 minutes except where police authorities or on-duty security guards have access to premises or vehicle and providing enforcement of this prohibition G) Requiring DPW to enforce restrictions on delivery and mover vehicles and on the operation of solid wast hauling equipment through limitations on vehicular operating permits to the hours of operation to between 7 a.m. and 5 p.m. weekdays and Saturdays at any location in or within 500 feet of a predominantly residential building or a residentially zoned district and by prohibiting waste hauling operations in such areas on Sundays; and 5) Improve natural resources planning and management within Ward 2 by A) Encouraging the Department of Recreation, working with the National Park Service, to improve existing programs that maintain and enhance Nard 2’s parks and open spaces B) Requiring the Zoning Commission to establish an open space zone designation to protect the ward’s privately owned parks, cemeteries, etc; and C) Ensuring that street and highway planning is consistent with federal standards for permissable levels of traffic vibration, noise, and air pollution, and that streets and highway planning reduces to a minimum the impact of non-local traffic on residential streets; land use patterns and transportation planning should strive to decrease reliance on automobiles ’SEC. 1200.210. WARD 2 TRANSPORTATION a) Transportation is a vital part of urban life. The special nature of transportation services and impacts in Ward 2 results from the location of the ward at the center of the city and region, at the focal point of the Metrorail system, bus lines, the freeway, and arterial street system. In many respects, residents of Ward 2, and employees who work in Ward 2, enjoy the best transportation access and service of any area in the city. At the same time, this location at the hub of the region’s transportation system produces some adverse impacts on the quality of life in the ward b) Metrorail has been the single most important factor in improving transportation access to the center of Washington. Ward 2 is at the center of the Metrorail system, which includes the Ked, Orange, 114 ENROLLED ORIGINAL Blue, Yellow, and Green lines. Within the ward, there are now 20 Metrorail stations in operation el These Metrorail lines bring about 250,000 riders per day into central Washington, primarily into Ward 2 (1992 Ward residents enjoy excellent Metrorail access to jobs in the Central Employment Area and for "reverse commuting" trips to outlying jobs. Since the stations are so close together at the center of the system, Metrorail also serves as a convenient neighborhood transit system for Ward 2 residents and employees d) Ward 2 is also the focal point for the Metrobus system with nearly 100 Metrobus routes running through the ward. Most of these routes converge on the Central Employment Area el Ward 2 is also the focus of major arterial streets feeding into the Central Employment Area. Arterials such as Wisconsin, Massachusetts, Connecticut, Georgia, New York, Maryland, and Pennsylvania Avenues carry automobile and truck traffic into the center city from outlying District neighborhoods and from the Maryland suburbs. To the south, traffic from Virginia moves across the Potomac P~iver into Ward 2 over the Key, Theodore ]~oosevelt, Memorial and 14th Street Bridges. Traffic from the eastern sections of the District and Maryland enters Ward 2 over the South Capitol Street, Frederick Douglass Bridge across the Anacostia P~iver. On a typical workday, 210,500 vehicles come into the central area of the city during the peak period (6:30 to 9:30 f) Once in the city, auto and truck traffic move over two types of street systems. The first is the system of diagonal avenues with an overlay of grid streets, a pattern derived from the L’Enfant Plan. The wide avenues and streets of this system are efficient for moving traffic, but the flow is complicated by the pattern of circles and squares g) The second type of system is the freeway system, consisting of the Southwest freeway, the Center Leg Freeway, and the Whitehurst Freeway along the Georgetown Waterfront h) In the late 1960’s, District citizens and the District government made a decision to limit freeway construction in favor of neighborhood preservation and Metrorail construction in order to stress urban and human values. No other freeway extensions are planned in Ward 2 i) Major volumes of automobile and service traffic must pass through Ward 2 neighborhoods, primarily along arterial routes, to reach the Central Employment Area. This traffic has some adverse impacts on these neighborhoods. In addition, some neighborhoods are also adversely impacted by both commercial and private motor vehicles circling around blocks in search of drugs and prostitutes ]) Parking is a problem in the Central Employment Area. Even with increased Metrorail use, parking demands arise with increased employment growth. There is a special need to provide short-term parking for retail customers, especially in Downtown k) Parking in the residential neighborhoods of Ward 2 is also a problem as the number of households increases. Since many dwellings do not have off-street parking, cars compete for limited on-street spaces. Many of the Ward 2 neighborhoods are adversely affected by spillover parking from the Central Employment Area. Some neighborhoods, such as Georgetown, Foggy Bottom, West End, and Dupont Circle, are also affected by evening visitors to restaurants, bars, and entertainment. 115 ENROLLEO ORiGiNAL Spillover parking problems are only partially alleviated by the neighborhood parking program. In addition, Foggy Bottom and Georgetown are adversely affected by student parking from George Washington and Georgetown Universities 1) Taxicab activity is concentrated in the central part of the city. Ward 2 residents and employees have the best taxi service in the city, but are still subject to many of the problems of current taxi operations. Improved and innovative taxi service, such as additional cabstands and better call service, could benefit Ward 2. ’(m) Pedestrian movement is the largest and most efficient means of transportation in Ward 2. Every workday, the over 400,000 employees in the ward walk hundreds of thousands of miles in the Central Employment Area and in other parts of Ward 2. Visitors and shoppers also walk many hundreds of thousands of miles in the ward; many residents can walk to shopping, entertainment, and cultural activities. Improvement of the safety and attractiveness of the pedestrian environment would encourage additional walking, a very worthwhile transportation investment. Residents would benefit from the construction of additional housing in areas adjacent to the Central Employment Area without unduly affecting the transportation system n) Commuter railroad service comes into Union Station from the Maryland suburbs. Commuter train service from Virginia began operation in 1992. More importantly, intercity Amtrak passenger service is provided from Union Station. Ward 2 residents, employees, and visitors have easy access to National Airport by way of Metrorail, taxi, and private automobile. At the same time, the noise caused by use of National Airport has an adverse impact on some Ward 2 neighborhoods, especially on Southwest, Foggy Bottom, West End, and Georgetown o) Bicycles also have considerable potential as a means of transportation in Ward 2. Bicycle use is relatively limited compared to the potential, but bicycle commuting by Ward 2 residents and others coming into the Central Employment Area is increasing. Bicycles are also heavily used by couriers in the central city area. Off-hour and weekend recreational use is probably as significant as the use of bicycles for the journey to work. Safety of bicyclists and security of parked bicycles are major concerns. Bicycles should be banned from sidewalks south of Florida Avenue, N.W due to the residential character of the neighborhoods and the narrow sidewalks p) The D.C. Bicycle Advisory Council has recommended a Bicycle Transportation Plan for the District of Columbia (June 1987 The recommended plan proposes a network of bike routes extending through Ward 2. The plan recommends additional study of bicycle use and safety improvements in the Central Employment Area q) Other forms of transportation in the Ward include boat service on the Potomac and Anacostia rivers and limited helicopter services SEC. 1200.211. WARD 2 OBJECTIVES FOtt TRANSPORTATION The objectives for transportation are as follows 1) Increase transportation access to the Central Employment Area; and 2) Improve mobility within Ward 2 for residents, employees, and visitors, while minimizing adverse transportation impacts on commercial areas and residential neighborhoods. 116 "SEC. 1200. 212. WARD 2 ACTIONS IN SUPPORT OF TRANSPORTATION OBJECTIVES "The actions in support of transportation objectives are as follows 1) Increase use of public transit and taxis by A) Strongly encouraging WMATA to make operational improvements to the Metrorail system by extending operating hours, improving lighting and directional signage in and around the stations, establishing a policy that at least one "up" escalator is operating at all times, and announce the beginning and end of rush hours; and B) Encouraging the D.C.

and C) In order to improve traffic flow, increasing Police/DPW enforcement of regulations for vehicles illegally blocking street lanes and increasing enforcement and removal of vehicles, especially commercial vehicles, parked on sidewalks and public space, especially in zoned residential areas 3) Maintain and improve streets and freeways in Ward 2, and improve streets in major Urban Renewal areas including Downtown, Northwest One, Lower Shaw and Southwest by A) Requiring DPW to increase its program for the repair, reconstruction, and redesign of streets, alleys, and freeways, including new sidewalks, curbs, and storm drain covers, where appropriate B) Requiring DPW to undertake a special study of future street construction needs in Buzzard Point/Near Southeast; and C) Encouring the city to consider pedestrian and bicycle needs when streets are redesigned and improved 4) Provide sufficient parking in the Central Employment Area and provide adequate parking in both residential and commercial areas by A) Requiring that the city and Downtown merchants adopt public/private parking management programs in the Central Employment Area where needed, in order to provide parking for short-term retail and business patrons and to discourage all-day commuter parking and develop special parking/loading programs for community commercial areas, with emphasis on problem parking areas, subject to the approval of the affected ANC B) Exploring innovative methods of providing additional parking such as leasing parking spaces at public facilities to parking 117 ENROLLED ORIGINAL operators for evening and weekend use in areas where parking is a problem, subject to the approval of the affected ANC C) Strictly adhering to current parking requirements of the zoning regulations except in the 14th Street, N.W Uptown Arts Overlay District and expeditiously implementing the Municipal Off-Street Parking Act; and D) Requiring DPW to require parking lot owners in residential and commercial districts to maintain public space in front of lots and requiring parking lots to be screened, landscaped, fenced and locked up at night or when closed; the DPW, the Zoning Commission, and the Board of Zoning Adjustment shall provide enforcement, licensing, and license inspections for these provisions 5) Increase pedestrian movement and safety and improve the pedestrian environment by A) Developing and implementing plans for streetscape and pedestrian improvements in Downtown and other sections of the Central Employment Area B) Developing adequate pedestrian walkways in areas of future development, including North Capitol Street, Buzzard Point/Near Southeast, and the Southeast Federal Center/Navy Yard C) Improving special connecting pedestrian routes such as M Street between Connecticut Avenue and Georgetown, the Monumental Core and Downtown, and pathways along waterfront areas in Georgetown and the Buzzard Point area D) Developing plans to improve pedestrian movement and safety in the Dupont Circle area E) Requiring DPW to ensure that existing pedestrian ways are maintained and requiring wider covered walkways, firmer flooring, and substantial overhead protection during the construction of new buildings or major renovation of existing buildings F) Requiring DPW to publicize, in the District of Columbia Register, its repair program for older commercial districts where sidewalks have deteriorated; and G) Ensuring that the locations of licensed sidewalk vendors are on public passageways of sufficient width that such vendors and their customers do not impede pedestrian movement and safety and that locations and numbers of newspaper vending machines also do not impede pedestrian movement especially at street corners and other street crossing areas and at Metrorail and bus stops 6) Implement the city’s Bicycle Plan recommendations for Ward 2 and undertake additional study of bicycle use within the Central Employment area, with particular emphasis on bicycle safety, parking, and security 7) Encourage innovative transportation by water 8) Support land use policies that encourage better use of transportation services throughout the entire city such as concentrating employment in the Central Employment Area, locating development near Metrorail stations, and developing new housing within walking distance of the Central Employment Area 9) Adopt regulations for "shared parking" between day time and night time users;

The Office of Planning is currently responsible for reviewing all projects recommended for inclusion in the CIP for consistency with the Comprehensive Plan 1) In general, the public facility recommendations support the upgrading of certain facilities, provide for, along with other improvements, the accessibility of the handicapped, as well as better maintenance of parks, playgrounds, and recreation centers SEC. 1200.214. WARD 2 OBJECTIVES FOR PUBLIC FACILITIES The public facilities objectives are as follows 1) Ensure the construction, rehabilitation, and maintenance of facilities essential for public service delivery to the ward’s current and future population; and 2) Provide for coordinated planning of public facilities construction or rehabilitation SEC. 1200.215. WARD 2 ACTIONS IN SUPPORT OF PUBLIC FACILITIES OBJECTIVES The actions in support of public facilities objectives are as follows 1) Monitor the reuse of surplus public properties to ensure reuses that are compatible with the existing character of the surrounding neighborhood 2) Work with private service organizations to ensure that their locations and operations do not create negative impacts in the ward 3) More adequately address fire, housing, and building code problems in Ward 2 public and private housing units; DCI%A, the Fire Department, and DPAH shall identify code problems in public housing units and program improvements 4) l%equire DCI%A, the Department of Human Services DHS and the Community Based Residential Facilities Office, working with the Board of Zoning Adjustment, to ensure that CBl%F’s are licensed and appropriately located throughout Ward 2, by requiring 500 feet minimum spacing between CBRF’s regardless of zones or number of occupants to minimize adverse neighborhood impacts; increases the umbrella of CBRF’s to include service providers, all tohave the same spacing requirement; no action to ensure the appropriate location shall 120 ENROLLED ORIGINAL violate the Fair Housing Amendments Act, approved March 12, 1989 (102 Star. 1619; 42 U.S.C. 3601 et seq Fair Housing Act For the purposes of this paragraph, the term ’handicap’ has the same meaning as in section 802(h DCRA to increase its enforcement of zoning regulations related to CBRF’s as part of a formal equitable distribution program involving all wards of the city 5) Since access to recreational facilities is inadequate and costly for residents, particularly for the elderly, disabled, handicapped and young children, increase the supply of recreational facilities in some of the more densely populated neighborhoods throughout the ward (the northern and western sections of Ward 2) by A) Continuing efforts to develop a variety of recreational opportunities for residents of the ward B) Requiring the Department of l~ecreation to increase efforts to meet the needs of special population groups, including programs for juveniles and the mentally and physically disabled and other persons who have been deprived of adequate recreational resources; and C) Encouraging the Department of l~ecreation and the National Park Service NPS to continue to work together to foster use of federal park and recreational facilities in Ward 2; and 6) Construct a new convention center on the 6 squares north of Mount Vernon Square SEC. 1200.216. WARD 2 URBAN DESIGN a) Ward 2 neighborhoods exhibit a variety of urban design characteristics. For instance, Georgetown has a very special character generally established by small-scale buildings along tree lined streets, encircled by a ring of parks. The Georgetown Waterfront, however, is an area that has undergone a significant change of character over the past 10 years b) Georgetown University, on a hi]] and largely removed from the activity of the city, has a number of Gothic buildings that establish an image of tradition. George Washington University, in Foggy Bottom at the edge of the Central Business District, is a much more urban campus. Fort NcNair, site of the Army War College, is a cross between a campus and a military enclave c) The Southwest area has a different physical character than other sections of Ward 2, having been almost completely rebuilt under the urban renewal program of the late 1950s and 1960s. In fact, urban renewal has had a significant effect on much of Ward 2 d) Some areas, such as part of the Buzzard Point/Near Southeast area, lack a strong design character, although development in the future will provide an opportunity to change this situation. The design of urban development is typically influenced by both formal and informal urban design processes. The most important formal design determinant in Washington, D.C and Ward 2) has been the Height Act of 1910, creating a strongly horizontal city e) Some parts of the ward receive detailed design review. The U.S. Commission of Fine Arts and the National Capital Planning Commission have long placed special emphasis on the design and development of the Monumental Core. The Architect of the Capitol has given special attention to the design of the Capitol area. Some other areas of Ward 2, adjacent to federal buildings and grounds, receive 121 ENROLLED ORIGIHAL design review from the Commission of Fine Arts under the provisions of the federal Shipstead-Luce Act. The Pennsylvania Avenue Development Corporation (PADC) administers a design and review process for the Pennsylvania Avenue Development Area. The 18 historic districts in the ward receive design review through the D.C. Historic Preservation Review Board. Development of urban renewal disposition sites receives design review from the Redevelopment Land Agency (RLA) Design Panel. WMATA also influences design on its parcels adjacent to station entrances and, of course, the Metrorail system itself influences many design decisions. However, while there is considerable design review activity in Ward 2, this review is somewhat disjointed. Some areas of the ward receive major design attention, while other areas receive almost none. Furthermore, there is no formal design plan for the entire ward, nor does there appear to be any sort of shared vision of how Ward 2 should look and function f) Urban design can also take place through informal means, through cooperative private efforts or when there is a consensus on desirable design character. The level of architectural design for individual buildings has generally improved lately as developers and their architects seem to be more concerned about the context of their buildings g) Much of Ward 2 has been redeveloped in recent years. Some sections of the ward are designated for preservation and design change in these areas will be limited. In other areas, there are opportunities to create a new design character. These opportunities exist now in the Downtown and to a lesser extent in the West End. They will exist in the future in Mount Vernon Square North and Buzzard Point/Near Southeast. The areas around two of the more recently opened (1991) Metrorail stations offer special design and development opportunities (Mount Vernon Square/UDC and Shaw h) The overall urban design goal is to promote the protection, enhancement, and enjoyment of the natural environs and to promote an environment that provides visual orientation, enhances the District’s aesthetic qualities, emphasizes neighborhood identities, and is functionally efficient i) Special emphasis has been placed on the urban design of Downtown. Objectives and policies dealing with the urban design of Downtown are included in the adopted Downtown Plan Element of the Comprehensive Plan SEC. 1200.217. WARD 2 OBJECTIVE FOR URBAN DESIGN The objective for urban design is to develop a quality urban design environment, combining old and new developments, taking maximum advantage of special design Opportunity Areas SEC. 1200.218. WARD 2 ACTIONS IN SUPPORT OF THE URBAN DESIGN OBJECTIVE The actions in support of the urban design objective are as follows I) Enhance the special design character and improve street design standards of the street system in Ward 2 by A) Establishing a committee to develop a uniform municipal sign system, including the review of prototypes for automobile and pedestrian directional signs to major public and private attractions; 122 ENROLLED ORIGINAL B) Encouraging the choice of unenclosed sidewalk cafes over enclosed sidewalk cafes, by amending the laws and regulations if necessary, in order to encourage pedestrian activity while maintaining the essential unobstructed continuity of the public space along sidewalks in commercial areas C) Enforcing the present law on the size of public passageways and increase the minimum size of public passageways in crowded areas; and D) l~evising the vending regulations to reduce concentrations of sidewalk vendors and to improve the appearance and public safety considerations of sidewalk vendors 2) Enhance the overall design character of Ward 2, and the special character of the different areas and neighborhoods of Ward 2, including those undergoing major redevelopment as follows A) The Office of Planning (OP) shall prepare urban design guidelines for areas within Ward 2 as part of its small area plans B) The city should include urban design guidelines as part of the planning progra[n for Development Opportunity Areas and for other areas that will undergo major development in the future (Mount Vernon Square North, West End, and South Capitol Street/Buzzard Point C) The city, in conjunction with community groups, shall place special emphasis on maintaining and enhancing distinguishable physical qualities including open spaces and landscape features throughout Ward 2 D) The city shall find ways to protect and enhance the special character of neighborhood eommereial centers, such as 7th Street, N.W 14th Street, N.W and M Street in Georgetown E) Uniform streetseape and building design guidelines including signage standards shall be created and approved by the main "design impact group The guidelines shall become part of the small area plans and the guidelines should not serve to overly restrict architectural creativity in design F) The 7th Street Design Plan shall be implemented. The Plan calls for streetseape improvements to all publieally owned land immediately in front of the private property line, all sidewalk areas, all parkways, all curbs, and all right-of-ways on both sides of the street from 1711 17th Street, N.W on the north, to 1500 17th Street, N.W on the south, and the adjoining, contiguous commercial areas of I Coreoran, Q, Church, and P Streets, N.W 3) Place special emphasis on the sensitive design of areas around Metrorail stations where new development is likely to occur respecting the integrity of those areas adjacent to those sites by A) Ensuring that detailed development and urban design plans are created for Metrorail station areas within the ward where new development is likely to occur; and B) Ensuring that development around and adjacent to the stations provides pedestrian amenities, ease of access, lighting, security, and signage befitting a portal to the city; in addition, adequate buffering and integration of new development into the surrounding neighborhood should be encouraged 4) Emphasize superior design of new development and open space along Ward 2 waterfront areas as follows: 123 ENROLLED ORIGINAL A) The city, working with the National Park Service, shall ensure that Ward 2 waterfront areas, including Georgetown, Maine Avenue, Buzzard Point and along the Anacostia River, provide public access and use B) Economic development incentives shall be used by the city to promote quality developments along waterfronts, with open space, parks for recreation and cultural programs, and street-level retail activity during the day and night C) The District government shall complete the park on District-owned Georgetown waterfront land south of K Street, with particular attention being given to lighting and security issues; and 5) Require strategies that will address the treatment of vacant buildings and vacant land. DCRA shall enforce the requirement that owners of property with vacant structures that remain vacant for more than 60 days shall secure them against unauthorized entry, including through windows, doors and public space, by the use of security bars, cinder blocks or security fencing as appropriate. The city shall place a lien on the property if the owner does not bring the property into compliance after the specified time period. DCRA shall develop programs that would encourage the owners of vacant building, particularly residential buildings, to sell or renovate SEC. 1200.219. WAI~D 2 PI~ESERVATION AND HISTORIC FEATURES a) Ward 2 is the oldest area of the city in terms of the physical development of the District of Columbia. The earliest commercial development, the first buildings of the federal government, and the earliest residential neighborhoods are all located in Ward 2. The legacy of the L’Enfant Street plan provides a fabric of special streets, squares, circles and other open spaces. Ward 2 is therefore especially rich in landmark buildings and historic areas, which help give it a unique physical character. Historic districts comprise a considerable portion of the land area of Ward 2. Ward 2 has the largest number of individual landmark buildings of any ward in the city and has 19 historic districts b) The historic districts listed on the National Register of Historic Places are (both individual sites and areas are included i) Dupont Circle 2) Foggy Bottom 3) Georgetown 4) Lafayette Square 5) Logan Circle 6) Massachusetts Avenue 7) Pennsylvania Avenue 8) 16th Street 9) Strivers’ Section; and 10) Blagden Alley-Naylor Court c) The historic districts determined to be eligible for the National Register are 1) Downtown; and 2) 15th Street Financial d) Federally-owned historic districts listed on the National Register are 1) C&amp;amp;O Canal; 124 ENROLLED ORIGINAL 2 3 4 5 6 7) East and West Potomac Parks; Ford’s Theater; National Mall; President’s Park South; Washington Monument and Grounds; and Analoston Island (Roosevelt Island e) The scale and character of these historic districts vary considerably. Thus, it is important that preservation activity take into consideration the unique characteristics of each historic district f) Despite this major historic preservation presence, there is still concern about the protection and enhancement of historic resources in Ward 2. This concern focuses on the preservation of landmark buildings, the historic character of certain streets and areas, and the preservation of the fabric, small scale and remaining open space in historic districts g) Existing programs for historic preservation are carried out by the District government, the federal government, and private organizations. The Historic Preservation Office of the Department of Consumer and Regulatory Affairs, which provides technical staff support to the D.C. Historic Preservation Review Board, is responsible for administering the District’s program, and functions within the regulatory framework o£ D.C. Law 2-144, Historic Landmark and Historic District l~rotection Act of 1978. The Mayor’s agent for D.C. Law 2-144 has the authority to determine demolition of landmarks or buildings in historic districts for "projects of special merit" or "projects in accordance with the Act This law needs to be changed to place the authority for demolition of landmarks or buildups in historic districts with the Historic Preservation Keview Board. The Historic Preservation Office provides some technical and financial assistance. The Historic Preservation Office is undertaking surveys and special studies to identify historic buildings and areas and determine ways to retain and use these resources h) A wide variety of other District programs contribute to historic preservation, including housing programs and capital improvements. The city and its agencies (including the Zoning Commission) will place special emphasis on preserving historic district’s and the buildings in them. Because of the historic federal buildings and lands in Ward 2, the federal government has a major role in protecting and enhancing the historic environment of Ward 2 i) Many citizen and neighborhood groups also play a vital role in preservation activities in Ward 2. The D.C. Preservation League, the city’s umbrella preservation organization, has been especially concerned with preservation activities in Ward 2, especially in Downtown. The Georgetown Citizens Association, the Foggy Bottom Association, the Logan Circle Community Association, and the Dupont Circle Conservancy have strong preservation programs j) Ward 2 has been the focus of a number of preservation struggles and many preservation victories. The preservation and reuse of the Old Post Office and the Willard Hotel are two special examples k) In terms of landmark buildings and historic districts, the preservation framework is generally established in most of Ward 2. The major exceptions are the Shaw Area and the Mount Vernon Square North Area, where additional designation of landmarks and establishment of districts may be warranted. 125 |NI OLLED ORIGINAL 1) The issue of preserving historic streets and open spaces is somewhat more complex. The street and open space pattern in most of Ward 2 is a reflection of the L’Enfant Plan, as modified over time. The avenues, streets and related squares, circles, parks, and open spaces of Ward 2 provide a special character and help establish a special image for Washington, D.C as a city and as the nation’s capital m) The design and maintenance of these streets and squares raises issues of historic character, which are related to urban design issues. The historic character of streets and spaces is influenced by the actual physical design and by activities. Obstruction of views, movement along Special Streets, and insensitive design of sidewalk cafes in historic districts, especially those attached to landmark buildings, can detract from the character of the historic district or landmark. Georgetown has its own unique street pattern with special characteristics. This pattern is not as formal as in other areas of the ward that were parts of the L’Enfant Plan. In the case of Foggy Bottom, its historic district is enhanced by Wasi~ington’s remaining 19th century alley dwellings which are virtually unique to the city n) The issue of a landmark street surfaced in the case of the 8th Street Vista through the Techworld project. The issue of historic streets and places usually involves not only historic preservation questions, but also broader questions of urban design o) Preservation provides 1 alternative view of the future, which stresses certain historical and environmental values over the "tear it down and start al! over" approach. A variety of forces will shape the preservation environment over the next five to 10 years. The concept of historic preservation has achieved growing community support that seems likely to increase in future years. An improved climate for investment in central Washington has made developers willing to invest in renovation in many areas of Ward 2 (although such activity decreased during the recession in the early 1990s This trend also is likely to continue, especially in the Shaw Area. Rising land values also bring new development and preservation conflicts SEC. 1200.220. WARD 2 OBJECTIVES FOR PRESERVATION AND HISTORIC FEATURES The objectives in support of historic preservation and historic features are as follows 1) To designate buildings and areas in Ward 2 meriting historic landmark or historic district protection 2) To preserve and reuse historic landmarks and buildings in historic areas in Ward 2 3) To preserve the design quality of historic and special streets and places in Ward 2; and 4) To preserve and protect existing buildings and small scale and open spaces in historic areas in Ward 2 SEC. 1200.221. WARD 2 ACTIONS IN SUPPORT OF PRESERVATION AND HISTORIC FEATURES OBJECTIVES The actions in support of historic preservation and historic features are as follows 1) The District government shall: 126 ENROLLED ORIGINAL A) Undertake surveys in Shaw and Mount Vernon Square to determine what additional buildings and sites should be designated as historic landmarks and what additional areas should be designated as historic districts B Complete process of designating additional landmarks and historic districts in Ward 2 B) Undertake studies of special streets and places in Ward 2, with emphasis on the major avenues, circles, and squares of the L’Enfant Plan, as well as community streets with special character 2) Require DPW and the Public Space Committee shall pay particular attention to the approval, design, and character of sidewalk cafes located in historic districts or attached to historic landmark buildings 3) Require DCl~A shall increase awareness of and access to facilities, places and activities in order that residents and visitors gain a fuller understanding of their culture and history. DCRA should focus special attention on the numerous historical and cultural facilities within Ward 2 to inform the general public of their existence and availability 4) Current residents are concerned that new historic district designations may result in displacement and neighborhood change. In Ward 2 the greatest concern is in Shaw. DCRA, DHCD, and DPAH should implement programs to assist the preservation of buildings for low- and moderate-income residents as required 5) The District government shall restrict excessive sidewalk vending activities as they detract from the character of historic districts and landmarks buildings 6) To ensure uniform design and preservation standards throughout the 19 historic districts in the Ward, the D.C. Historic Preservation Review Board shall, upon request of the affected ANC, review all permit applications relating to new construction, alterations, or demolition in the historic district without exception. The review shall occur on the record at a public hearing in full conformity with the provisions of D.C. Law 2-144 and shall provide affected ANCs full participation in conformity with the ANC Act, irrespective of any other design review 7) To ensure consistent design and preservation standards throughout the 19 historical districts in the ward, the Mayor’s agent shall issue written decisions in all protested cases in full accordance with D.C. Law 2-144 and the ANC Act 8) The Office of Planning shall develop regulations which will prohibit a developer of a "Large Tract greater than 50,000 sq. ft. or 3 acres) from evading "Large Tract Review" by dividing the project into "stages" or "phases" which individually are less than the threshold size, but which, when aggregated, exceed it. ’I(9) The Office of Planning, upon request of the affected ANC, shall apply its Large Tract Review procedures to developments involving one to three acres 10) Open space traditionally associated with public and privately owned historic properties, such as yards, gardens, and large estate grounds, shall be retained whenever possible to protect the integrity of the property and its sense of setting 11) DCRA shall address address the problem of "demolition by neglect" of buildings in historic districts demolition by neglect" 127 ENROLLED ORIGINAL refers to buildings that are permitted to deteriorate irretrievably) by adopting enforceable regulations and providing substantial fines or property seizure for chronic offenders in any significantly contributing building within a historic district or landmark. These regulations shall be adopted and enforced within twelve (12) months of the adoption of this provision SEC. 1200.222. WARD 2 ttUMAN SERVICES a) The availability and efficient distribution of needed human services are especially critical in Ward 2. This stems primarily from the fact that Ward 2 has the most diverse mix of housing, shopping, and employment in the city. The metropolitan region’s primary retail and office center, the core of the federal government, and neighborhoods as old as the city itself are in Ward 2. The result is a wide and varying need for human services within the ward b) Human services delivery systems must be able to meet the needs of the daily influx into the city’s Central Employment Area as well as the needs of the Ward’s resident population. Ward 2 has a total of 2,124 units of public housing. Social problems,including drug abuse, crime, and prostitution are prevalent in the 12th Street, 14th Street, R Street and P Street, N.W areas, as well as other areas in Ward 2. In 1990, Ward 2 had a median family income of $40,458 compared to a median family income of $36,256 for the District. In 1990, 21 percent of the ward’s families were in poverty as compared with 17% for the city. Ward 2 has an above average percentage of dependent population and, as a result, a greater need for human services c) The District’s Department of ttuman Services DHS is the District’s primary human services agency and carries the responsibility for implementing the Human Services Element of the Comprehensive Plan. In conjunction with other District agencies and private organizations, DHS’s mission includes: providing social, economic, and health support for those people who cannot otherwise secure it; ensuring that citizens with temporary needs have access to programs that help them gain and maintain independence; and contributing to the improvement of the health, well-being and quality of life for residents and visitors to the District of Columbia. To facilitate the provision of services, DHS has 6 clinics and 4 service centers in Ward 2 SEC. 1200.223. WARD 2 OBJECTIVES FOR HUMAN SERVICES The objectives for human services are as follows 1) To offer a comprehensive range of community based social services for those in need 2) To promote health, environmental, and life-style conditions to strengthen the well-being of the ward’s children and youth 3) To promote conditions to enable persons with disabilities to participate as fully as possible in the life of the ward 4) To promote programs of needed health, social services, and support levels for older adults and mentally disabled persons to enable them to maintain themselves with a sense of security, dignity, self-respect, and independence; and 5) To insure that services are spaced at 500-foot intervals regardless of zones or occupancy. 128 ENROLLED ORiGiNAL "SEC. 1200.224. WARD 2 ACTIONS IN SUPPORT OF HUMAN SERVICES OBJECTIVES "The actions in support of human services objectives are as follows 1) The District government shall develop ways to deliver health and social services that are indispensable to those in need throughout the ward. Particular attention should be focused on the homeless, households headed by women and the elderly. DHS should provide for the transportation of low-income families and teenagers to various educational programs, as required 2) The development of the Perry School as a community services center and the reorganization and improvement of the Walker-Jones Clinic as a community health facility are important objectives 3) The District government shall maintain concentrated crime-reduction programs throughout the ward. The Metropolitan Police Department MPD should enforce the laws against prostitution and other illicit activities and ensure that hotels, inns, and other transient occupancies, and vacant or abandoned property do not become centers of illegal activity. MPD should increase police presence throughout the ward particularly in the areas in which illicit activities are currently concentrated, and expand ward police and community relations especially focused on community cooperation efforts on crime prevention. The District government shall strengthen the community empowerment program of community oriented policing (COP) through assignment of quality of life police officers in cars and especially on foot patrols in neighborhoods 4) The District government shall distribute public information and fact sheets on public safety services to local businesses, residents, and tourists. The District should support public education programs in churches, schools and related centers to deal with drug abuse, crime, and prostitution. The District should establish better communication between the public and private sectors to publicize the availability of various educational programs in churches, schools, and related centers in the ward and other areas in the District and surrounding communities 5) The District government shall expand programs to serve the unprecedented number of homeless persons as follows A) Expand cooperation with, and seek the support of, the large network of private and voluntary agencies engaged in human service activities so that adequate social services will be provided to the homeless; increase the number of programs which provide child care services for the children of homeless families These programs should provide the children with early childhood development opportunities, and allow the parents the freedom to get job training and seek permanent housing B) Monitor programs developed to aid the homeless in the city to ensure the highest quality of care and services possible with the limited resources available C) Increase programs for training and employment of the homeless D) Urge the Mayor’s Committee on Persons with Disabilities and the Department of Human Services to develop additional support systems to assist persons who have been "deinstitutionalized and 129 ENROLLED ORIGINAL E) Implement D.C. law to provide registration of homeless persons seeking shelter and provide drug and alcohol abuse counseling. w(6) The District government shall develop strategies that will address the needs of older citizens to allow them to continue contributing to society and lead useful lives by A) Encouraging the Office on Aging to expand existing programs or develop new programs so that the elderly can continue to make a contribution to their communities B) Increasing dissemination of information in the community regarding health and social services offered by the District for the elderly; and w(C) Expanding cooperation with, and seek the support of, the large network of private and voluntary agencies and organizations engaged in human service activities (particularly those which specialize in serving senior citizens) so that adequate social, economic, and health services will be provided to the senior citizens of the ward that complement those provided by the District SEC. 1200.225. WARD 2 LAND USE a) Within Ward 2 there are wide variations in the scale, density and patterns of development. One way to conceptualize Ward 2 is to think of it as a series of concentric rings b) In the center of Ward 2 is the Monumental Core, an area of formal parklands and key national buildings and monuments, including the Capitol, the White House, the Washington Monument, and the Lincoln and Jefferson Memorials. Subareas of the Monumental Core include the U.S. Capitol, the Mall, West Potomac Park, the Federal Triangle, The Northwest Rectangle and extending south, East Potomac Park. Roosevelt and Columbia Islands in the Potomac River are both entirely federally-owned park land c) The Architect of the Capitol is responsible for planning the development of the Capitol Complex. The remaining area of the Monumental Core is the responsibility of various federal agencies, especially the National Park Service, the General Services Administration and the Smithsonian Institution, all operating within the overall planning framework established by the National Capital Planning Commission (NCPC This area of parkland and monumental public buildings comprises much of the national and international image of Washington, and is a major attraction for the 19 million visitors to Washington each year d) The second ring is the Central Employment Area, which surrounds and includes the Monumental Core. This is the major retail, office, and hotel area of the city. This large Central Employment Area includes the commercial areas of Downtown, the Connecticut Avenue and K Street area, and the Southwest Employment Area e) Around the Central Employment Area on the north and south is a third ring of distinctive areas, primarily residential neighborhoods, but including some commercial areas. These include Foxhall, Burlieth, Georgetown, Foggy Bottom, West End, Dupont Circle, Logan Circle, Shaw, Northwest Number Urban l~enewal Area, the Southwest residential areas, Fort McNair, and the Ward 2 portion of Buzzard Point/Near Southeast. 130 ENROLLED ORIGINAL rf(f) A wide range of planning programs and land use and design controls guide development in Ward 2. Federal master planning covers the Monumental Core and other major federal areas, including Fort McNair. The Architect of the Capitol has prepared a master plan for the U.S. Capitol Complex. The Pennsylvania Avenue Development Corporation, a federal development agency, guides the development of federal and private land along the north side of Pennsylvania Avenue between the White House and the Capitol. Non-public land is controlled by zoning, except in the Southwest Urban Renewal Area, where urban renewal plan controls are used. Zoning is replacing urban renewal controls in Southwest as the urban renewal controls expire. Area B in Southwest received new zoning in 1993 and zoning for Areas C and will be put in place in the mid-1990s g) The ward includes all or part of 6 urban renewal areas: Southwest; Downtown; Shaw School; Northwest Number 1; and H Street. Ward 2 also has more landmark buildings than any other ward in the city, and includes 19 historic districts h) The land use patterns in Ward 2 include a diversity of uses at a wide range of densities. Some areas are essentially fully developed and will be subject to relatively little change. In other areas, change will be dramatic. The following sections describe key areas in summary terms, including the current situation, how conditions will change over time, and major development pressures, trends and opportunities CENTRAL EMPLOYMENT AREA Monumental Core a) Planning for the Monumental Core is the responsibility of the federal government. The development of this area of parks, monuments, museums and government buildings is relatively complete. However, there are some opportunities for additional development. These include the Holocaust Museum (which opened in 1993 the National Sculpture Garden, and the Federal Triangle Project (under construction The Judiciary Office Building on Columbus Plaza adjacent to Union Station opened in 1992. The Master Plan for the Capitol outlines sites for additional congressional buildings, if needed, in the future b) The challenge to the District government is to plan and promote linkages between the Monumental Core and adjacent areas. For economic reasons, the District is anxious to attract visitors from the Monumental Core into adjacent areas, especially Downtown Downtown a) The Downtown area between the Capitol and the White House, north of Pennsylvania Avenue, is now the major area of development in the city. This is expected to continue over the next 10 to 15 years. A new development pattern has generally been established on the western portion of Downtown. Land use objectives and policies have been outlined and adopted as part of the Downtown Element of the Comprehensive Plan. Progress in achieving office and hotel land use targets has been excellent and good progress is being made in achieving retail development. Progress on arts and residential development has been more limited, though important initial development in the Pennsylvania Quarter 131 ENROLLED ORIGINAL neighborhood has been impressive. New Downtown development was limited in the 1990-1993 period because of economic conditions b) The public-private Downtown partnership, an organization established to help achieve a "Living Downtown was a combined effort of the District government and private sector. Special efforts are being focused on the Retail Core, the 7th Street Arts Area, and Chinatown. Operations of the Downtown Partnership were suspended at the end of 1992 due to lack of financing Connecticut Avenue and K Street The development pattern in the Connecticut Avenue and K Street area, which was the major development area in the city from 1960 to the early 1980’s, is now established and there will be little change over the next 5 to 15 years. There will be infi]l development on a few remaining sites. Opportunities for development include some additional office space, increased retail space and streetscape improvements Southwest Employment Area a) The development pattern in the Southwest Employment Area, north of the Southwest Freeway, is well established. The Aeronautics and Space Administration Building, the building for the U.S. International Trade Commission and a building for NASA have been recently completed. The Portal site is the largest remaining development parcel and will continue to be developed over the next 10 years. The Portal site will include office, retail and hotel uses. The first office building has been completed b) Opportunities for improved connections with the waterfront from the Portal site and the L’Enfant Esplanade (10th Street Mall) need to be addressed THE NEIGHBORHOOD RING George Washington University Continuing pressure from the university, resulting from the destruction of housing, the extensive construction of buildings leased for commercial use, and complete lack of construction of dormitories is of grave concern to the Foggy Bottom residential community. Intense student pressure on Foggy Bottom’s housing stock outside the campus, combined with the impact of university generated traffic has had an extremely disruptive effect on residential Foggy Bottom. Additional measures will be needed, including adequate dormitory construction and the conversion of buildings leased to commercial use for dormitory use, if an acceptable urban campus environment if GWU is to be achieved Georgetown a) This neighborhood includes the Georgetown waterfront area, the area south of M Street, the M Street and Wisconsin Avenue commercial strips, the small-scale residential areas east and west of Wisconsin Avenue, and Georgetown University. Georgetown is unique in Ward 2 in being almost completely encircled by parks and open space. Major mixed-use development has occurred south of M Street in the past 15 years. Completion of the long-promised waterfront park, now in the first 132 stage, and retention of the remaining open space along the Georgetown waterfront will add a new amenity for Georgetown and the city b) l~enovation and new fill-in construction has occurred over the past decade along the M Street and Wisconsin Avenue commercial strips. New retail and eating establishments have made Georgetown one of the most active and interesting commercial areas in the city. However, there is growing concern about the impact of development and the crowds on the ambience of commercial and residential Georgetown. Public safety is an increasing concern among Georgetown residents and business people. Special efforts will still be necessary to limit the impact of the development and the crowds on adjacent areas Foggy Bottom/West End a) Foggy Bottom has two types of development: mid- and high-rise residential buildings and small-scale townhouses. Mid-rise residential buildings extend along most of K Street, from 26th Street to Washington Circle, with the exception of the buildings within the Foggy Bottom Historic District along the south side of K Street, N.W east of 25th Street, N.W which are low-rise, while Virginia Avenue and New Hampshire Avenue are a mixture of predominantly-residential, high-rise buildings and small-scale townhouses. Columbia Plaza and Watergate, both major mixed-use, predominantly-residential complexes, are south of Virginia Avenue. The Watergate and Columbia Plaza complexes include office and retail uses. There are several hotels and office buildings in the area. In the center of the neighborhood is an area of small-scale townhouses, most of which have been renovated beginning in the 1950s. The Foggy Bottom Historical District, which was designated in 1986 and rezoned more restrictively in 1992 as the Foggy Bottom Overlay District, will provide protection for this area. The residential development pattern in Foggy Bottom is established b) The West End, just north of Foggy Bottom, is a former industrial and residential area that has been undergoing major change over the past 10 years. The area was rezoned in 1975 to encourage mixed-use development. Since that time there has been major development of office, hotel and apartment buildings, l~emaining underdeveloped sites in the West End are expected to be filled in over the next 10 years. The opportunity remains to enhance the M Street corridor, connecting the Connecticut Avenue area and Georgetown through the West End Dupont Circle The general pattern of development in Dupont Circle is established. Commercial and residential renovation and in-fill development will continue, guided by the constraints of the Dupont Circle Historic District and the Dupont Circle Overlay District. The area is becoming increasingly attractive for in-town living as a result of the growth of Connecticut Avenue and Downtown as employment centers, and by commercial revitalization along Connecticut Avenue, 17th Street, and U Street to the north. The major pressure is the continuing erosion of residential use by office use and the displacement of local services by retail uses that attract a broader market, l~estaurant and entertainment uses in the Connecticut Avenue areas are having an increasing impact on residential areas in terms of evening parking. The opportunity remains to retain and improve this unique in-town neighborhood. 133 ENROLLED ORIGINAL "Logan Circle/Shaw. ’l(a) The large area, extending from 15th Street to New Jersey Avenue, includes a wide range of residential development, from large historical mansions and townhouses around Logan Circle to small row houses west of 7th Street. High-rise apartment buildings are located in the southwest corner of the area near Downtown, and in several locations along 7th Street and 14th Street. Low-rise and garden apartment buildings also have been built on urban renewal sites east of 7th Street. The area also includes the Shaw Junior High School complex on Rhode Island Avenue, as well as numerous other public buildings and churches. W’(b) Major renovation of residential buildings in the Logan Circle area has been underway for some time, with renovation activity generally moving eastward. There is also a cluster of renovation activity along M Street east of 7th Street. Residential and commercial renovation and new construction are expected to continue over the next 10 years c) The Logan Circle/Shaw Area benefits from renovation activity moving east from Dupont Circle, the growing employment base in Downtown, and the renovation and new construction in the U Street corridor to the north. The opening of the Metrorail Green Line along 7 Street in May 1991 provided 3 new Metrorail stations in or adjacent to the area (Mount Vernon Square/UDC, Shaw/Howard University, and U Street stations The Shaw Metrorail Station has entrances at 7th and S Streets, N.W and 7th and tt streets, N.W. The station access and the availability of attractive rowhouses are drawing new residents to the Shaw neighborhood. As renovation moves eastward, it is producing some displacement problems d) Renovation and new construction are already beginning in the 14th Street corridor from Thomas Circle to U Street, though there are still problems with prostitution, drugs and other criminal activity, and an overconcentration of Community Based Residential t~acilities (CBRP’s) and other service provides for the homeless. ’w(e) The Office of Planning, along with area business persons, residents and other agencies, prepared a small area study of 14th Street between Thomas Circle and l~lorida Avenue. The study recommended creation of a multi-use, multi-neighborhood retail strip along 14th Street. Restaurants, offices, arts spaces and theaters are among the uses that could thrive in a redefined 14th Street corridor. Zoning to implement the study has been adopted Mount Vernon Square North a) Mount Vernon Square North is a triangular area bounded by Massachusetts Avenue, M Street and Third Street, N.W. It is located north of Downtown and south of the Logan Circle/Shaw area. It is one of the major Development Opportunity Areas in Ward 2. The pattern in the western edge of the area is established with a number of existing apartment buildings along Massachusetts Avenue. The northwest corner of the area is also established with the recently completed Paradise Gardens housing development and row house renovation, centered on M Street between 7th and 4th Streets. Much of the rest of the remaining area is subject to change, being either vacant or under-utilized land. The Comprehensive Plan indicates mixed-use and high-density residential development. The Mount Vernon Square Area is designated as a Housing Opportunity Area. 13 £NROLLED ORIGINAL b) The District government controls two key properties, the Mount Vernon Square/UDC campus site (four squares) and the remainder of the "Wax Museum" site (Urban P~enewal Parcel l It is anticipated that much of the Mount Vernon Square North area will be rebuilt over the next 10 to 15 years. This will create an attractive mixed-use neighborhood north of Downtown c) The District government should develop a new convention center on the six squares north of Mount Vernon Square, between 7th and 9th Streets, N.W extending north to N Street N.W design the convention center to relate to the adjacent areas, and prepare land use and urban design plans to accommodate appropriate convention center related development, especially along Massachuseets and New York Avenues, N.W North Capitol Street The area west of North Capitol Street (Northwest 1 Urban l~enewal Area) is generally built up. It includes high-rise apartments, townhouses, schools, churches, the Gonzaga High School complex, and a new office building. Only limited development possibilities remain. The southern part of Northwest 1 is occupied by the Government Printing Office GPO which is to expand south to Massachusetts Avenue. Establishing an appropriate relationship of the new GPO development to Massachusetts Avenue, assuring community benefits from the development of the Prevocational School site and other sites within and to the east of the area and minimizing the traffic impact on the Northwest 1 area from commercial developments within and around the area including the commercial area of Northeast Number 1/Eckington Yards are especially important issue Southwest a) Southwest was completely rebuilt in the 1960’s as one of the country’s first Urban l~enewal Projects. The area is primarily residential, but includes restaurants and commercial buildings along Maine Avenue, the Arena Stage, and Waterside Mall, plus a variety of public facilities near South Capitol Street. Fort McNair is located south of P Street. Southwest is adjacent to the Central Employment Area. Accessibility was improved when the Green Line Waterfront Metrorail Station opened in late 1991 b) Forty years after urban renewal began, Southwest provides a mature and pleasant environment. Appropriate steps are needed to protect the character of the area, including resolving the issue of zoning as the Southwest Urban Renewal Plan controls expire in the 1990s. Zoning for Area t~ was completed in 1992. Major new development is not anticipated but attention needs to be directed to key problems in the area, including improving retail services at Waterside Mall, improving the attractiveness and amenities along the Maine Avenue waterfront, and improving housing maintenance in the Greenleaf Gardens and James Creek public housing projects Major Land Use Themes for Ward 2 The development pattern of Ward 2 is varied and complex. A review of the different areas of the ward indicates 11 broad land-use 135 ENROLLED ORIGINAL themes or issues that need special attention. The themes or issues are as follows 1 Maintain Existing l~esidential Neighborhoods. ’t(A) Most of the major residential neighborhoods of Nard 2 (Georgetown, Foggy Bottom, Dupont Circle, Logan Circle, Mount Vernon Square North, Shaw, Northwest Number 1 and Southwest are arranged like parts of a pinwheel around the Central Employment Area Foxhall and Burleith are farther west A residential neighborhood is under development Downtown. At present, the Downtown residential community is small, fragmented, and a reminder of the past rather than a hope for the future unless the government intervenes B) The overriding issues for Ward 2 neighborhoods are the threat of commercial encroachment (including hotels and medical clincis/doctors’ offices the impact from uses such as community based residential facilities, university expansions, chanceries, and numerous parking and traffic problems C) Commercial development in Dupont Circle has had a major impact on adjacent area residents where loss of the housing stock is a critical issue. Loss of the housing stock is also a critical problem in Foggy Bottom/West End, aggravated by the lack of dormitory construction on the GNU campus, a lack of construction of new housing, and the attractiveness of the area to non-residential users. Conversions of housing units, particularly apartments, to transient use (hotel, defacto hotels, and corporate apartments to university dormitories and offices, and to medical offices/clinics is a major cause of the depletion of the housing stock. Moreover, continued commercial, hotel, and institutional expansion has caused major traffic and parking problems, thus adding to the disruption of residential life. The Shaw and Logan Circle areas are experiencing some displacement due to commercial and residential renovations and are affected by commercial development. An overconcentration of community-based residential facilities threatens neighborhood stability in some areas, especially at Logan Circle, Thomas Circle, and the Shaw area 2) Development of the central employment area The Central Employment Area is the business and retail heart of the District and the metropolitan area. Office use, in terms of square footage, is the largest commercial use in the Central Employment Area. The Central Employment Area also contains the largest amount of retail floor space and the greatest sales volume in the metropolitan area. It contains the major department stores and leading specialty shops of the region. The Central Employment Area also has numerous boutiques and restaurants and the largest number of hotels in the District. The term "Central Employment Area" is defined in section 107(5) of the Comprehensive Plan. It is bounded by Massachusetts Avenue and H Street, N.W on the north; Second Street, N.E. and S.E on the east; the Southwest Freeway and Constitution Avenue west of 14th Street on the south; and by the Expressway, Virginia Avenue, N.N First Street, N.W Pennsylvania Avenue, N.W 22nd Street, N.W and New Hampshire Avenue, N.N on the west. Except for a small section east of the Capitol, all of the Central Employment Area is in Nard 2. Some adjacent commercial areas are closely related to this area. Continued coordinated development and revitalization of the Central Employment Area 136 ENROLLED ORIGINAL is vital to Ward 2, and to the entire city. Linkages between the commercial areas and the Monumental Core are also important 3) Creation of a Living Downtown A) Downtown Washington is the area between the Capitol and the White House, north of Pennsylvania Avenue to Massachusetts Avenue. This was the original commercial area of Washington. Beginning in the 1950s, development began to shift to the west and simultaneously the Downtown began to deteriorate B) Today, efforts to revitalize Downtown are being realized. The city is promoting a "Living Downtown This means a mix of land uses producing activity during the day, in the evening, and on the weekends. It also means a mix of new and old buildings to achieve a special design character for different areas of Downtown C The Mayor’ s Downtown Committee outlined recommendations for Downtown in 1982. Those recommended policies and objectives were adopted as the Downtown Element of the Comprehensive Plan. The D.C. Downtown Partnership was established in 1984 to implement the Downtown Plan D) The revitalization of Downtown now underway has important implications for the ward, especially adjacent areas such as Mount Vernon Square North, Northwest Number 1, Shaw, and Logan Circle. Major progress has been made towards achieving the land use targets outlined in the Downtown Plan. Progress is most evident in office, retail and hotel development but action is needed to achieve housing in Downtown and adjacent areas to the north 4) Office development A) The need for office space to house public and private sector employment is the major "driver" of other development in the ward. Much of the new development to the year 2000 in the center of Ward 2, and in the Development Opportunity Areas, will be new office construction. It is important to achieve continuing office development in the District in the face of suburban competition. Office development in Downtown is strong, but stopped almost completely in the 1990-1992 period. Most Downtown sites will be developed by the year 2010. Therefore, it is important to provide new sites for office development in the Development Opportunity Areas, especially in the North Capitol Street and Buzzard Point/Near Southeast areas. An appropriate office environment must be created that meets the challenge of suburban office parks B) Emphasis on office development tends to focus on private office development. However, it is also important to obtain additional federal office space construction 5) Hotel development A) Hotels are a key element of the economic development of Washington and are important activity generators. Ward 2 is the hotel center of the city. At the end of 1992, Ward 2 accounted for 77 of the 87 hotels and 18,804 of the 22,106 hotel rooms in the city. Hotels in Ward 2 are primarily concentrated in Downtown, the Connecticut Avenue area, and the West End, with smaller clusters in Dupont Circle and Southwest B) Major progress has been made in achieving hotel construction goals, but efforts are still necessary to reach, and if possible exceed, the target of 12,000 new rooms in the city in the 137 ENROLLEO ORIGINAL 1980-2000 period. Approximately 11,000 of these new hotel rooms would be in Ward 2. From 1980 to 1992, 8,850 new hotel rooms have been built in Ward 2. Locating hotels in strategic areas, such as south of the Washington Convention Center is especially important C) Since many new hotel rooms have come on the market in a short period, there seems to be a temporary over-supply. However, over the long term, additional hotels will be built to fulfill increased demand from visitors, tourists, business people, and conventioneers D) Some citizen groups are concerned about the impact of hotel development on nearby residential areas, especially along Massachusetts Avenue north of Downtown, in Foggy Bottom, the West End, and in Southwest. The Office of Planning recognizes these concerns and believes that the location and development of new hotels must be carefully coordinated to avoid adverse neighborhood impacts E) The District government should encourage the development of new hotels at appropriate locations near the proposed new convention center north of Mount Vernon Square 6) Arts, culture, and educational uses. Washington, D.C. is becoming one of the great arts and cultural~educational centers of the world. Many of these cultural and educational resources are located in or adjacent to Ward 2. Although these resources are available to all residents of the city and region, Ward 2 residents have a special advantage because of their proximity to these resources 7) Development Opportunity Areas A) Downtown is the current area of major development in Ward 2. Development of Downtown should be largely completed over the next 10 to 15 years. The Comprehensive Plan Identifies the following 3 Development Opportunity Areas in Ward 2 i) Portal site ii) Buzzard Point/Near Southeast; and iii) Mount Vernon Square B) The areas of Ward 2 enumerated in subparagraphs (A)(i iii) are where major development will take place in the future especially as major rebuilding of Downtown is completed C) The Buzzard Point/Near Southeast area now contains deteriorated public housing, light industry, marginal small businesses, a military installation, federal buildings, and vacant sites, but has the potential for becoming a prime waterfront site and southern gateway into the city D) The Mount Vernon Square area has potential for major development, including significant residential and hotel development, because of its proximity to Downtown and the construction of the new convention center on the District owned site north of Mount Vernon Square 8) Major institutional complexes A) Ward 2 has 2 types of major institutional complexes. Federal areas comprise the first type and large university campuses are the second type. There are three major federal areas in the ward: Monumental Core (including West Potomac Park the Capitol Complex; and Fort McNair. The linkages and relationships of these federal areas to the adjacent commercial and residential areas are especially important. Planning of these areas is within the overall planning framework 138 ENROLLED ORIGINAL established by the National Capital Planning Commission and carried out by the General Services Administration. lW(B) These federal areas need to relate to the adjacent commercial and residential areas of Ward 2. The Monumental Core and the Capitol complexes are especially important because they comprise large areas of the center of Ward 2, are the focus of visitor attention, and provide cultural attractions for city residents C) Two university campuses, George Washington and Georgetown, are located in Ward 2. The future development plans of these universities should not adversely impact surrounding, adjacent residential areas 9) Community and neighborhood shopping areas A) Community and neighborhood shopping areas are essential parts of the convenience and character of the residential neighborhoods of Ward 2. In size and shape, they include corner stores, small clusters of stores, the major retail strips (Connecticut Avenue and 14th Street) and a mall (Waterside Mall Some neighborhoods in Ward 2 do not have adequate commercial and service establishments. In others, too much development is adversely affecting adjacent residential areas. In some areas, needed lower cost stores and service establishments are being displaced by higher price W~upscale" establishments. Certain kinds of commercial activity, such as fast food restaurants, can cause problems in residential neighborhoods. The impacts of fast food restaurants and liquor-licensed restaurants have been concerns in some neighborhoods B) The Waterside Mall in Southwest has not become a vital commercial center due to high rents and poor marketing. The opening of the Waterfront Metrorail Station may allow the mall to operate at least as a multi-neighborhood shopping center 10) Waterfront development Waterfront land is a great asset in the District of Columbia. Waterfront land may best be used as parkland, while adjoining sections may be used for mixed-use developments. A substantial amount of shoreline is in public ownership. Much of it is parkland administered by the National Park Service and accessible to the public. There are problems and opportunities all along the Ward 2 waterfront A) The Georgetown waterfront area is emerging as a major activity center, with new parkland west of the Washington Harbor complex. Additional improvements in the form of landscaping and open space are needed. There is a considerable unmet demand for nonmotorized boating facilities along this waterfront. Additional boathouses for nonmotorized vehicles are needed west of the Washington Harbour complex; these facilities shall be sited to also allow for public fishing B) Encourage the National Park Service (’NPS to make improvements in NPS-controlled waterfront areas. A continuous, landscaped, safe and secure walkway-bikeway connection between the National Park Service areas and the Georgetown waterfront area will greatly enhance the Ward 2 waterfronCs value as an urban amenity and recreational resource. An updated plan for the Georgetown waterfront should be prepared to include an enhanced pedestrian/bikeway circulation system. 139 ENROLLED ORIGINAL C) Thompson’s Boat House is in need of major structural repairs. The tidal flats next to East Potomac Park need to be cleaned up D) Southwest waterfront remains relatively inaccessible and underused while the adjacent fish market, in need of physical improvements, continues to be supported by throngs of patrons E) The Fort McNair waterfront is relatively restricted to the public F) The Buzzard Point waterfront represents a vast untapped resource G) At present, there is no clearly articulated vision of how the waterfront areas in Ward 2 can be better used and how they relate to adjacent areas 11) Metro station development Ward 2 is the focus of the Metrorail system, the place where the Red, Orange, Blue, Yellow, and Green lines converge. Ward 2 has 20 Metrorail stations. In addition, the U Street/Cardoza, Judiciary Square, Union Station, Navy Yard, and Capitol South Stations are nearby. Consequently, Ward 2 has the best Metrorail service and access of any area of the city and region. Despite these advantages, development around the Metrorail stations in Ward 2 is uneven. At some stations, such as Farragut North and L’Enfant Plaza, the development pattern is essentially established. At other stations, such as Gallery Place and Union Station, there are still opportunities for development. w’SEC. 1200. 226. USE The objectives for land use are as follows 1 To conserve and enhance existing neighborhoods in Ward 2 2) To create new residential neighborhoods; and ~’(3) To maintain existing park land. WARD 2 OBJECTIVES FOP~ ttESIDENTIAL LAND residential "SEC. 1200.227. WAttD 2 ACTIONS IN SUPPOItT OF ttESIDENTIAL LAND USE OBJECTIVES The actions in support of land use objectives are as follows 1) The Diustrict government should: ’W(A) Maintain and enhance older established residential neighborhoods and areas, including Foxhall, Burleith, Georgetown, Foggy Bottom, West End, Logan Circle, Shaw, and Dupont Circle B) Maintained as a residential area to promote the retention and expansion of current residential uses, and discourage the expansion of commercial uses, the Dupont Circle area north of Massachusetts Avenue, N.W and east of Connecticut Avenue, between 15th Street on the east and Florida Avenue on the north; and south of Massachusetts Avenue, west of Connecticut Avenue, N.W to 23rd St N.W Kock Creek Park) and north of N Street, N.N t’(C) Protect and enhance new residential neighborhoods and areas, including Northwest Number ] and Southwest; and t’(D) Complete residential (non-hotel) development in the West End 2) Because of the considerable number of GWU development projects now being proposed, GWU should reexamine its campus plan in 140 ENROLLED ORIGINAL consultation with the Foggy Bottom community. At a minimum, GWU should include dormitory construction (the design of which reflects the current living space preferences of GWU students and the price of which is competitive with housing units in Foggy Bottom) not only to meet the needs of additional enrollments but also to correct the over-intrusion of parts of the student body into the housing stock outside the campus area. This intrusion has been a detriment to the older, established residential neighborhood of Foggy Bottom, a community which contributes income and property taxes as well as a labor force to the Downtown 3) The District government should A) Develop a major new urban residential community in the Pennsylvania Quarter area of Downtown (Housing Opportunity Area B) Retain existing residential development in Downtown and develop new housing in Downtown in the area extending north of Pennsylvania Avenue through Gallery Place, Chinatown, and portions of Judiciary Square C) Develop a major new residential community in the Mount Vernon Square North area (North of Massachusetts Avenue, N.W with commercial buildings on sites desginated for high density commercial on the Generalized Land Use Map D) Undertake special housing improvement programs in the housing areas of Greenleaf Gardens and to Syphax Gardens E) Develop a major new residential community as part of a mixed-use development in the Buzzard Point/Near Southeast area F) Urge the Office of Planning to conduct small area studies, including market analyses and site development plans for new Ward 2 neighborhoods; this is especially important in the Mount Vernon Square North area and the Buzzard Point/Near Southeast area; and G) Encourage the Department of Recreation to undertake detailed, specific analyses of the potential need for more recreational facilities in Shaw 4)(A) The District government should insist that the Department of Consumer and Regulatory Affairs DCRA and the Department of Human Services DHS shall enforce zoning-based ordinance requirements concerning distance between community based residential facilities, to include Community l~esidence Facilities CRF and homeless service providers, and evaluate impacts to date on neighborhood stability B) Require that all community based residential facilities, to include Community Residence Facilities (CRF’s) and homeless service providers, be registered with the District of Columbia C) Establish a moratorium on future community based residential facilities to include Community l~esidence Facilities (CleF’s) and homeless service providers in neighborhoods where the over-concentration of CBRFs has had negative neighborhood impacts, except that the moratorium shall not violate the Fair Housing Amendments Act, approved March 12, 1989 (102 Stat. 1619; 42 U.S.C. 3601 et seq Fair Housing Act For the purposes of this paragraph, the term ’handicap’ has the same meaning as in section 802(h) of the Fair Housing Act (42 U.S.C. 3602(h 5) The Southwest Urban Renewal Plan SWURP serves in lieu of zoning. Zoning must be phased in immediately upon termination 141 I NROLLED ORIGIHAL of Section C-1 in 1995 and Section C in 1996. Zoning for Section B was completed in late 1992. During development of the zoning plans, no major changes in the SWUl~P should be considered. Further, I~LA shall seek out qualified developers for the underdeveloped parcels of the SWUI~P as soon as possible 6) To carry out the policy in the Comprehensive Plan of "conserving and maintaining the District’s sound, established neighborhoods through the strict application and enforcement of housing, building and zoning codes and maintenance of the general level of existing residential uses, densities, and heights the city should continue to enforce the zoning regulations and recommendations of the Comprehensive Plan with respect to negative neighborhood impacts, especially of commercial expansion and the overconcentration of CBI~F’s 7) The District government should coordinate the management of various promotional activities in Ward 2, such as street festivals in order to maintain the integrity and function of adjacent residential areas 8) The Zoning Commission should place hotels, medical clinics, and doctors’ offices in a category other than "residential given their extremely negative impact on residential neighborhoods 9) Existing park land between 26th Street, N.W and 29th Street, N.W shall not be zoned unless a new zone is created which is limited to parks 10) A substantial part of the amenities provided in proposed Planned Unit Developments (PUDs) shall accrue to the community in which the PUD would have an impact 11) The District government should A) Develop the 7th Street Corridor from Mount Vernon Square north to Florida Avenue, including new infill development and renovation B) Allow general office use in the Central Employment Area (CEA) south of Massachusetts Avenue in the area designated in the high-density commercial category and require the Zoning Commission to change the zoning in these areas to be consistent with the Land Use Map; particular attention should be given to those non-profit and other national associations’ need in the CEA to encourage their retention and expansion in the CEA; and C2) Ensure that uses of SP-zoned buildings shall i) Be in harmony with the surrounding residential neighborhood; and ii) Shall include residential use for not less than 50 percent of their floor area ratio SEC. 1200.228. WARD 2 OBJECTIVES FOl~ OFFICE DEVELOPMENT The objectives for office development are as follows i) To encourage development of office buildings in appropriate locations in Ward 2, especially in the Central Employment Area and in Development Opportunity Areas; and 2) To retain and increase federal employment in Ward 2 in new federal buildings and in leased space SEC. 1200. 229.

WARD 2 OBJECTIVE FOl~ METRORAIL STATION DEVELOPMENT The objective for Metrorail station development is to achieve the optimum development of Metrorail station areas in terms of land use, transportation and urban design, related to the development of the surrounding area SEC. 1200. 243. WARD 2 ACTIONS IN SUPPORT OF THE METRORAIL STATION DEVELOPMENT OBJECTIVE The actions in support of the Metrorail station development objective are as follows 1) Continue to improve the land use mix and urban design qualities of operating Metrorail stations Downtown where the development pattern is essentially established (Farragut North, Foggy Bottom, Farragut West, McPherson, Smithsonian and L’Enfant Plaza the Dupont Circle Metrorail station’s Q street entrance should be maintained as a plaza to be compatible with the adjacent residential neighborhood 2) Undertake additional efforts to improve the land use mix and urban design qualities of operating Metrorail stations when the development pattern is not yet fully established (Metro Center, Gallery Place, Chinatown, Judiciary Square, Union Station, Federal Triangle, Federal Center-Southwest, and Archives/Navy Memorial 3) Undertake special efforts to plan the land use mix and urban design character for the area where recently completed Metrorail stations Mount Vernon Square/UDC and Shaw) have special opportunities 4) Undertake coordinated planning for nearby Metrorail stations (Capitol South, Navy Yard and U Street the Office of Planning 147 EHROLLEO ORIGIHAL shall submit to the Zoning Commission necessary zoning changes, program capital improvements, and take other actions in accord with small area plans (Uses, density, and height limits should be generally compatible with existing adjacent land uses or in accordance with small area plans 5) Encourage WMATA and DPW to improve information and directional signs to Metrorail station areas (Providing maps and signs at Metrorail stations in Ward 2 is especially important because of the large volume of visitors in the area who do not know the city 6) Develop a special character Metro Place~T) at Metrorail stations through the design of new development, retention of historic buildings, landscaping, art works, and special activities. 148 ENROLLED ORIGINAL "SUBTITLE 3 "SEC. 1200. 300 "SEC. 1200.301 "SEC. 1200.302 "SEC. 1200. 303 "SEC. 1200.304 "SEC. 1200. 305 "SEC. 1200.306 "SEC. 1200. 307 "SEC. 1200.308 "SEC. 1200.309 "SEC. 1200. 310 WARD 3 PLAN "TABLE OF CONTENTS WARD 3 GENERAL PROVISIONS WARD 3 ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT WARD 3 HOUSING WARD 3 ENVIRONMENT WARD 3 TRANSPORTATION WARD 3 PUBLIC FACILITIES WARD 3 URBAN DESIGN WARD 3 PRESERVATION AND HISTORIC FEATURES WARD 3 HUMAN SERVICES WARD 3 LAND USE "SEC. 1200.300 WARD 3 PLAN "SEC. 1200.301 GENERAL PROVISIONS a) This plan ~or Ward 3 has been developed with 3 guiding principles i) The ward plan should focus on issues unique to Ward 3. If a planning issue is applicable to the ward only because of its citywide import, then it more likely belongs in another element of the Comprehensive Plan and not the ward plan 2) This ward plan follows the format of the first 11 elements of the Comprehensive Plan. It supplements the Plan and, for the most part, interprets the Comprehensive Plan’s more general objectives and policies. The ward plan attempts to apply the first II elements to the ward. In some instances there is no statement in the ward plan corresponding to a statement (or even a subsection) in the Comprehensive Plan; this omission most likely means that the Comprehensive Plan statement is applicable without qualification to the ward 3) Generally, the ward plan should contain answers, not merely state issues b) Ma~or Themes For Ward 3 1) Protecting the Ward’s residential neighborhoods. Ward 3’s most outstanding characteristic is its low density, stable residential neighborhoods. Although the ward’s communities retain individual and distinctive identities, a shared concern from American University Park to Woodley Park and throughout is one of pride and co~nmitment to neighborhood and home. Residents seek to ensure that stability is maintained. Accordingly, no significant land use changes have been indicated in the first 11 elements of the Comprehensive Plan, and it is a major theme of this ward plan to protect and maintain the low-density, high-quality character of tile ward 2) Controlling redevelopment. Ward 3--its residents, businesses, and institutional establishments--are significant contributors to the District’s total economy. While the people of the ward recognize and generally take prid~ in this contribution, their singlo greatest concern is the possibility of unrestrained development diminishing the quality of life. With 2 of the city’s longest and busiest commercial corridors, Connecticut and Wisconsin Avenues, this sentiment is justified historically. The last 2 decades have witnessed major redevelopment in 149 ENROLLED ORIGINAL Friendship Heights, Tenley Circle, Spring Valley, Van Ness (at Connecticut Wesley Heights, and Woodley Park, and unsuccessful redevelopment efforts in Cleveland Park, Glover Park, and McLean Gardens. Major redevelopment is often accompanied by undesirable effects, particularly increased traffic. This presents problems for small businesses (e.g loss of parking, higher rents) and has spillover effects penetrating nearby residential neighborhoods The economic development goals for Ward 3 differ from those in other wards. The Economic Development Element of the Comprehensive Plan is principally concerned with the generally agreed upon need to stimulate more economic development overall in the District. From the point of view of the District as a whole and the ward in particular, this need does not apply to Ward 3. Rather, the issue in Ward 3 is how to channel the very strong momentum of economic development that exists while protecting and enhancing the primarily residential nature of the ward--a quality of life that in turn attracts additional economic pressures for development The economic development called for in the Comprehensive Plan will be of greatest benefit and viability to the District as a whole if two conditions are present i) growth is targeted where most needed as reflected in the overall plan for the city; and (ii) strong residential areas are maintained throughout the city (which makes the District more attractive to the types of organizations that the District considers desirable Without such areas, many organizations may prefer to locate outside the District 3) Preserving and promoting cultural and natural amenities. The combination of development pressure and environmental awareness has led to an increased appreciation of the wardWs natural resources. These resources include Rock Creek Park, Glover Archbold Park, Battery Kimble Park, and Fort Reno Park, as well as numerous smaller parks, recreation centers, playgrounds, and open spaces. Many of the ward’s larger parks and natural recreation areas function as resources for the entire city, as well as ward residents. The loss of open space and natural areas is an important concern. So, too, is the potential disposal of land owned by the federal government much of which is undeveloped or borders park lands. Development on or near park borders is another threat to the ward’s natural resources. Thus, it is a major theme of this ward plan that the integrity of park lands be maintained and improved wherever necessary Ward 3 has a variety of cultural resources, including colleges and universities, religious institutions, community centers, and other public and private facilities. In this regard there is sometimes tension between protecting or promoting these resources on the one hand and limiting their potential for adverse impacts on the other. One example is the Washington National Cathedral, a great tourist attraction. It should be protected from nearby dense development that would despoil its setting. But its attractiveness generates tourist traffic that often clogs nearby roads. Another example is the presence of major universities which have vast cultural and educational resources available to local residents. Yet ward residents are concerned that the growth of these institutions will be incompatible with overall community goals and objectives. It is a major theme of this ward plan that there be a balancing between promoting and limiting these resources and their potential. 150 ENROLLED ORIGINAL 4) Preserving the historic character o~ the v~ard. Although the buildings in Ward 3 are relatively new compared to the average age of structures in the older parts of the city, there are numerous historic sites, structures, and districts throughout the ward. It is a major theme of this ward plan that qualifying landmarks throughout the ward be respected and preserved 5) Sharfng the burden, l~esidents of Ward 3 feel anguish at the unrelenting problems, such as homelessness and hunger, facing the less fortunate throughout the city. There is no question that the ward must share in the social challenges of the city, but sometimes an issue has arisen in terms of scale, such as how large a facility should be. This is in keeping with the low-density quality o£ the ward. There is strong support in the ward for scattering small-scale homeless shelters throughout the ward (which is being actively promoted in churches providing counseling and referral facilities on the commercial corridors, and accepting small community residence facilities within the single family neighborhoods of the ward. It is a major theme of this ward plan that such efforts, in compatible scale and scattered throughout, continue as appropriate SEC. 1200.302 ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT a) PREFACE. Like many other areas, Nard 3 is primarily a residential sector of the District, rather than a center for commercial or industrial activity. Because of this, Ward 3’s role in contributing to the District’s economic development is limited to 1 naintaining existing commercial and institutional uses 2) maintaining and expanding the residential component; and (3) carefully controlling infill development The primary economic development issue for Ward 3 is not whether to stimulate more development, but rather how to control the strong development pressures that already exist. These pressures arise largely from the relative affluence of the ward’s population, lower costs for commercial land, excellent transportation, and perceived public safety. Managing economic development in the ward can benefit both the ward and the city as a whole: by maintaining the ward’s qualities while redirecting development to other, more desirable, areas of the city As with every ward, there is a need to ensure that any new non -residential development is sensitive to, and avoids adversely affecting, proximate residential areas. For Ward 3, any new development also must be physically compatible with the predominantly low- and moderate-density character of the ward. Since most of the ward’s commercial areas are designated low density in the Land Use Element, with many also designated as local neighborhood centers, new commercial development in those areas should be of the type that provides a range of goods and services necessary to support the household needs of the ward’s residents In these low density or local neighborhood centers, the need to provide a variety of retail services is important. The concentration of uses (e.g bars and restaurants) should be avoided. Office space should be limited and be incidental. Ward 3 already provides an important economic base to the District; yet, it offers some further economic opportunities. Those opportunities can be enhanced by a variety of actions such as parking and loading studies, streetscape plans, transportation system management measures, and more efficient solid 151 ENROLl.El) ORiGiNAL waste management. However, the wards need for public actions is not as great as other ward’s; the Comprehensive Plan’s policies for joint public-private ventures and community development corporations are necessarily focused elsewhere b) RELATION OF WARD 3 TO THE DECLARATION OF MAJOR POLICIES IN THE ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT ELEMENT OF THE COMPREHENSIVE PLAN i) The ward can play a role in the District’s function as the National Capital and economic center of the region 2) The ward is host to public sector activities such as the Naval Observatory, Vice President’s house, U.S. Naval Security Station, Dalecarlia Water Treatment Plant, and the National Zoo 3) The ward is host to major institutional activities such as the Washington National Cathedral, the National Presbyterian Center, Sibley Memorial Hospital, the Army Distaff Foundation (Knollwood and Youth For Understanding. Major educational institutions include The American University, the University of the District of Columbia, the Howard University Law School, Mount Vernon College, Wesley Theological Seminary, the Washington School of Ballet, and numerous public and private primary and secondary schools 4) The ward is host to several major corporations including the Federal National Mortgage Association and 4 commercial television stations serving the region: WI~.C[NBC; WTTG/FOX; WJLA[ABC; and WUSA/CBS 5) The ward is host to international activities such as the International Center, INTELSAT, the chancery complex for Eussia, and numerous embassies 6) The ward hosts significant convention facilities at the Washington Sheraton and the Omni Shoreham hotels 7) The ward has regional and multi-neighborhood retail centers at Friendship Heights, Tenleytown, and Connecticut/Van Ness c) ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT AND GROWTH GOALS 1) Resfdentfal Development: Ward 3 can contribute to the economic viability of the District through the protection and promotion of its residential character. This residential sector contributes significantly to the District’s population and also to the District’s tax base through substantial property, income, and other tax revenues 2) Commercfal Development: The defined commercial areas within Ward 3 are already established but do present limited opportunities for infill development. This commercial economic development must be tempered with the overall residential nature of the ward. Commercial development should be strictly limited to areas currently zoned for commercial activity and not be allowed to extend into areas currently zoned as residential. Any new development should contribute foremost to the range of retail goods and services that are necessary to support the household needs of Ward 3 residents 3) There is no opportunity for industrial economic development in Ward 3 d) Any new economic development in Ward 3, because of the stable and overwhelmingly residential nature of the ward, must be evaluated in terms of compatibility and potential adverse impacts on neighborhoods. 152 ENROLLED ORIGINAL d) EFFECTIVE ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT AND GROWTH OBJECTIVE AND POLICIES. Economic development and growth in Ward 3 can be achieved without resort to the joint public and private economic development entity called for in the Economic Development Element e) DISTRICT PROMOTION OBJECTIVE AND POLICIES. Ward 3 can contribute to the DistricUs promotion objective in two ways 1) Enhancing tourist attractions such as the Washington National Cathedral, National Zoo, l~ock Creek Park, C &amp;amp; O Canal, and the Fort Circle Park System; and encouraging potential attractions such as the Naval Observatory. For those that are federal sites, the District can promote improvements to adjacent public and privately owned land 2) Ensuring that major gateways into the District, in Ward 3, are attractive in a manner consistent with the McMillan park-like objectives of the city f) STIMULATING PRIVATE SECTOR GROWTH OBJECTIVES AND POLICIES 1) The wardVs economic development is dependent on private sector initiatives, which have been stimulated by the economic characteristics of the ward and without the substantive governmental action suggested in the Economic Development Element. For Ward 3, unlike some other areas of the city, public action is needed less to stimulate private sector initiatives than to control them 2) The priority for stimulating and facilitating a variety of commercial, retail, and residential development investments appropriate to selected Metrorail station areas outside the Central Employment Area should be consistent with the Land Use Element and accompanying maps g ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT OUTSIDE THE CENTRAL EMPLOYMENT AREA OBJECTIVE AND POLICIES. Ward 3 presents the opportunity for discrete, highly-focused economic activity at specific locations 1) Development of housing, with some retail and limited office space, at Tenleytown on the east side of Wisconsin Avenue between Albemarle and Brandywine streets 2) Development of housing at Friendship Heights, particularly in the extant, large parking lots (Lord &amp;amp; Taylor and Metro 3) Chancery, institutional, and office infill development in the Connecticut and Van Ness area 4) Infill low density neighborhood-serving commercial at the local neighborhood centers identified in the Land Use Element. w~(5) Development of single family housing at the "Miller Tract" to the west of Massachusetts Avenue near Westmoreland Circle 6) Development of multi-family housing on Wisconsin and Connecticut avenues consistent with the land use designations in the Land Use Element h) NEIGHBORHOOD AND MULTI-NEIGHBORHOOD RETAIL AND COMMERCIAL CENTERS OBJECTIVE AND POLICIES. Economic development and growth in Ward 3 can be achieved without resorting to community development corporations CDC co-venturing, and public resource leveraging called for in the Economic Development Element i) PUBLIC ACTION OBJECTIVE AND POLICIES. The Office of Planning should develop a unified streetscape plan for Ward 3, including guidelines for the type of amenities which new developments must include 153 ENROLLED ORIGINAL in order to be approved, and an enforcement plan which includes penalties adequate to promote compliance SEC. 1200.303 HOUSING a) PREFACE. Ward 3’s existing housing stock ranges from low density to high density. There are several large estates of historic significance; there are a number of neighborhoods almost entirely comprised of detached single-family homes; there are several neighborhoods distinguished by semi-detached homes and rowhouses; and there are apartment buildings of every size along the avenues. Two characteristics the prevalence of detached single-family housing and the concentration of medium and high density housing on 3 major avenues distinguish Ward 3 from the other wards. The overall demand for housing in Ward 3 has remained strong over the years, including times of recession. Between 1970 and 1980, and again between 1980 and 1990, the number of occupied housing units increased in Ward 3 in both decades going against the city-wide trend toward a net loss of units. This growth in Ward 3 has resulted from the relative safety in terms of crime, an acceptable balance between population size and accessible, neighborhood-serving goods and services, public schools that operate well with strong parental support, and from the general stability of the ward’s neighborhoods in spite of sometimes intense pressure for redevelopment. The ward’s housing supply is in generally good condition, in large part a reflection of economic demand. Sales and rental prices are among the highest in the city, and the ward continues to be an attractive residential choice for a relatively affluent population. These two characteristics stability and affluence doubly benefit the city by significantly contributing to the tax base while requiring minimal social services. One public policy issue is the need for "affordable" housing. There is one public housing site in the ward, the 160 unit l~egency House for senior citizens on upper Connecticut Avenue. The relative dearth of low- and moderate-income housing in the ward is in large part attributable to development pressures. These pressures have caused the conversion of thousands of moderate-income rental stock to more upscale condominiums or, along Wisconsin and Connecticut Avenues, to office space. The conversion or replacement of older housing stock has particularly disadvantaged the elderly, low- and moderate-income renters, and young workers lust entering the lob market. On the other hand, the large number of conversions of rental apartments to condominium units has enabled the ward to continue providing ownership opportunitiesto individuals and families otherwise priced out of the housing market. To some extent Ward 3 is a victim of its own success. Its success is reflected in property assessments. As assessments escalate, those residents unable to afford the higher housing costs face displacement particularly retired people on fixed incomes who purchased their homes long ago. Thus, the major public policy issue confronting the ward is the prevention of further displacement of residents, particularly those with low- and moderate-income, as a result of redevelopment, conversions, and escalating taxes. 154 ENROLLED ORII INAI. There is little vacant property available for development. The vacant parcels that do exist are small in size (available for what planners term "infill" development and even in the aggregate are not suitable for significant development of new housing in the ward. However, there is underutilized land in the ward that should be the focus for the development of new housing; these areas have been designated in the Land Use Element as housing opportunity areas. While new housing is needed, all development proposals must be evaluated to avoid adverse impacts on neighborhood stability, traffic, parking, and environmental quality b) RELATION OF WARD 3 TO THE DECLARATION OF MAJOR POLICIES IN THE HOUSING ELEMENT OF THE COMPREHENSIVE PLAN 1) Ward 3 can meet the housing needs of many current and future residents. It is a predominantly residential ward with only about 5% of its zoned land in non-residential use. The Land Use Element designates several housing opportunity areas in the ward reflecting the ability of the ward to provide new housing 2) Ward 3’s housing stock is generally sound and the ward has been a leader in the city’s production of new units. The ward exceeds the city-wide average in percentage of owner-occupied units. Much of the ward’s housing stock is benefitting from downzonings and zoning overlays adopted between 1986 and 1994 and from historic landmark and historic district protections under D.C. Law 2-144 3) The ward also provides a significant share of the city’s rental housing. Tenant associations have increasingly organized to further the policy of maintaining reasonably priced rental stock 4) The ward’s land use policies, as stated in the Land Use Element, have been developed to provide the greatest housing densities on those corridors that have the best access to transportation and shopping. Two of the ward’s housing opportunity areas are designated at Metrorail stations; development potential (if any) should favor housing over commercial at the ward’s other 3 Metrorail station areas 5) Ward 3 must be particularly sensitive to the needs of its elderly population, which comprises 17% of the ward and is proportionately the highest in the city. Housing for the elderly must be maintained and increased, especially along the major transportation and commercial corridors of Connecticut and Wisconsin Avenues c) GENERAL HOUSING OBJECTIVES FOR WARD 3 1) In light of the history of displacement described in the preface to this section, general development pressures throughout the ward should not be promoted, but must be controlled. Existing housing should be maintained and improved for current and future residents 2) Where new development is permitted or is prescribed in the Land Use Element, use such development to provide additional housing, particularly for the elderly and low-to moderate-income populations. Encourage a mix of populations within new or renovated multi-family structures, with up to 20% of the units set aside for low- and moderate-income residents d) POLICIES IN SUPPORT OF THE GENERAL HOUSING OBJECTIVES. The District government should: 155 EHROLLEO ORIGiHAL 1) Work with the private sector (both owners and community groups) to identify sites and increase housing development opportunities in appropriate locations designated in the Land Use Element 2) Expand housing opportunities for the elderly, especially along the major transportation corridors and in the Friendship Heights and Tenleytown Housing Opportunity Areas 3) Provide zoning flexibility for the production of new housing, especially for the elderly and for low- and moderate-income households, through the following mechanisms A) Permitting increased residential densities (consistent with design scale and infrastructure capacity) in exchange for incorporating low- and moderate-income or elderly housing in development projects; ’(B) Considering the provision of elderly and low- and moderate-income housing, when it is a substantial portion of a project, as an important amenity in Planned Unit Developments, provided that such housing shall be on site (given the need for affordable housing in Ward 3, off-site housing shall be disfavored C) Kestricting major commercial development in the Friendship Heights and Tenleytown housing opportunity areas D) Tying the provision of housing into commercial developments when rezoning or other zoning benefits are sought; mixed-use developments should be encouraged in commercial zone districts; and E) Giving zoning preference to projects that include housing near each of the ward’s Metrorail stations 4) Use the Large Tract Review process (10 DCMtt 2300) and other approval mechanisms to encourage housing 5) Use municipal bond financing for projects with 20 percent set asides for the elderly or low- and moderate-income residents 6} Do not consider hotels or other transient uses as meeting the housing objectives for Ward 3 7) Discourage encroachment of nonresidential uses into residential areas 8) Provide more stock by encouraging the inclusion of housing in local neighborhood commercial centers; and 9)(A) Permit congregate housing while providing adequate regulation to minimize and eliminate adverse effects on surrounding residences; congregate housing is a means to meet the housing needs of the ward’s student population as well as young wage earners and others desiring group living; and B) R.equire that the ward’s universities and colleges provide adequate housing for and. promote its use by their student populations e) PUBLIC ACTION OBJECTIVE AND POLICIES 1) l~eview recent regulations permitting accessory apartments in single family dwellings to ensure the optimum balance between the purposes of lower-density residential zoning and the public policy to provide more housing opportunities 2) Develop an outreach program, within the Department of Housing and Community Development, to acquaint residents with existing housing assistance programs that are available in Ward 3. 156 3) l~evise the real property tax code to mitigate the impact of substantial tax increases on Class 1 property owners with limited or fixed income 4) ttevise the Planned Unit Development regulations, and treat housing, when consistent with this ward plan and when for low, moderate, or fixed-income households, as an important public amenity SEC. 1200.304 ENVIKONMENT a) PREFACE. The quality of the total environment both natural and human reflects the interplay of a myriad of District activities and programs, and depends on the ways in which environmental protection efforts are discharged and how they relate to other District activities and programs. The environmental issues confronting Ward 3 in large part affect other wards, too. There is a general need for improved planning for, and management o£, the ward’s natural resources. The ward shares the city’s need for improved air and water quality, solid waste management, quality of land, environmental health and sanitation, water and energy conservation, food production and urban gardens, and reducing the impact of aircraft noise. Ward 3, unlike most of the city’s other wards, is characterized by open spaces, an abundance of greenery, and a predominantly low density built environment. The ward covers 5,986 acres (excluding public rights-of-way) of which about half is park land (including Rock Creek Park (and tributary valleys Zoological Park, Glover Parkway and Children’s Playground, Whitehaven Parkway, Battery Kemble, and the C &amp;amp; O Canal Ward 3 has the lowest population density in the city: 16 persons per acre for the ward as a whole and 28 persons per acre in residential areas. The categorization of environmental issues in this Ward 3 Plan follows the organization of the Environmental Protection Element of the Comprehensive Plan, and therefore certain issues may not be found easily. For instance, the need to protect park land from incompatible development adjacent to park borders is discussed under the objective for water quality and the need to promote tree landscaping is discussed in part under the objectives for air quality and energy conservation. It is essential that future growth and change be sensitive to the protection and enhancement of the total environment. The existing environment should not just be maintained, but must be improved b) RELATION OF WARD 3 TO THE DECLARATION OF MAJOR POLICIES IN THE ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION ELEMENT OF THE COMPREHENSIVE PLAN Because the Comprehensive Plan does not contemplate substantial economic development in Ward 3, the environmental policies of this ward plan are less a response to planned growth, change, and renewal, and are more a direction for improving the environmental quality of an already-built ward c) ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION GOALS The preservation and improvement of the environmental qualities of Ward 3 including maintenance and enhancement of its park and open space system, protection of its healthful verdancy, and encouragement of design solutions that promote both conservation and improvement of the ward’s resources are the primary environmental goals for Ward 3 d) IMPROVING WATER QUALITY OBJECTIVE AND POLICIES The District government should: 157 1) Separate combined sewers located in park lands; the combined sewer in Glover Archbold Park may be the largest in the ward; separating it or at least removing Foundry Branch from the sewer would have the dual benefits of reducing current burdens on the city’s sewerage system and significantly improving the environmental quality of this park 2) Require strict controls in connection with construction to prevent soil erosion that may directly or indirectly (via storm sewers) cause sedimentation of the ward’s streams; such controls could often include sedimentation ponds, which may need to be permanent 3)(A) Promote an increase in plantings (particularly trees but also shrubbery and encourage the use of permeable surfaces for parking lots, driveways, etc. to reduce storm runoff B) Map the Tree &amp;amp; Slope Protection overlay (11 DCMI~ 1511) in hilly areas throughout the ward in addition to Woodland-Normanstone; and C) Evaluate storm water outfalls into the ward’s stream valleys; link the approval of development projects to the improvement of affected outfalls, with the objective of improving, not just maintaining, the quality of water runoff; and 4) Identify and protect wetlands areas on private land, usually to be found proximate to the ward’s stream valley parks; not only should this be accomplished by an official survey of the ward when government resources permit, but this must be an application requirement for individual development proposals e) IMPROVING AIR QUALITY OBJECTIVE AND POLICIES 1) The District government should A) Minimize unnecessary automobile idling by synchronizing traffic signals and, between midnight and 6:00 a.m by operating most traffic signals other than on Wisconsin and Connecticut Avenues as flashing amber or red B) Evaluate tour bus needs to reduce idling; facilities that attract tour buses and require discretionary governmental approvals should, when possible, be subject to conditions to mitigateexcessive idling; and C) Encourage institutional and large corporate residents to promote public transit usage and discourage employee reliance on single-occupant vehicles; this should be a condition when possible in connection with discretionary governmental approvals 2)(A) The Land Use Element is drafted in part to minimize reliance on automobiles and instead promote pedestrian transit and public transportation B) Industrial-type facilities are likely to have a negative effect on the ward’s air quality. The ward is not zoned for industrial use, and therefore any such use could only exist in connection with a large self-supporting institution. Any industrial-type facility, including a power generating plant, should be strictly limited to the needs of the host institution 3) There must be an aggressive policy to replace trees (both public and private) and to plant additional trees. A healthy, verdant urban forest provides numerous environmental benefits, including better climate and air quality that result from the cleansing of automobile exhaust and the production of oxygen through photosynthesis. 158 f) SOLID WASTE MANAGEMENT OBJECTIVE AND POLICIES Residents of Ward 3 have shown strong support for the District’s fledgling recycling program. Indeed, the ward has thus far offered one of the few locations in the entire city for the collection of household hazardous waste. With little effort the government could maximize recycling in this ward; at a minimum, the District should maintain its one recycling drop-off site at Guy Mason, or move it to another, more central, location g) PROTECTING THE QUALITY OF THE LAND AREAS OBJECTIVE AND POLICIES 1) The overall environmental quality of the ward’s land areas can be protected by A) Requiring that any construction preserve natural features B) Promoting extensive planting, especially of trees; if the plantings are a condition to a permit, then there shall be a proviso to include a reasonable requirement for landscape maintenance; and C) Minimizing any development adjacent or proximate to the ward’s stream valley parks (e.g Rock Creek Park and Glover Archbold Park) that infringes on views from the park, creates erosion or sedimentation problems, adversely affects or is plausibly suspected to adversely affect flora or fauna, or that has any negative impact on the park land 2) All discretionary construction approvals should be conditioned on an affirmative answer to the question: does the proposed project provide a net gain for the ward environmentally h) Reserved i) Reserved j) CONSERVING ENERGY OBJECTIVE AND POLICIES Two of the policies in support of other environmental objectives for Ward 3 also further the conserving energy objective for the ward i) an aggressive campaign to protect trees and promote new plantings; and (ii) encouraging the use of permeable surfaces for parking lots, driveways, etc because permeable surfaces maintain water tables and, depending on design, may allow ground cover such as grass to grow upon it A healthy urban forest mitigates heat island effect and reduces energy demand such as for indoor air conditioning k) FOOD PRODUCTION AND URBAN GARDENS OBJECTIVE AND POLIUIES The ward currently hosts a number of community gardens in areas including Glover Park (near 42nd Street and Tunlaw Road McLean Gardens (at 39th and Newark Streets Tilden Gardens (on Sedgwick Street near Connecticut Avenue and 45th and Warren streets. Existing gardens should receive basic city support services, and new community garden sites should be encouraged 1) REDUCING THE IMPACT OF AIRCRAFT NOISE OBJECTIVE AND POLICIES Ward 3 residents, particularly along the Potomac Palisades, are heavily impacted by noise from air traffic utilizing Washington National Airport. To eliminate adverse noise impacts on Ward 3 (and other District) residents, this ward plan reiterates plan policies that the Metropolitan Washington Airports Authority and the Federal Aviation Administration be encouraged to i) prevent the introduction of 159 EHROLLED ORIGIHAL wide-body jets it) maintain or reduce the number of hourly commercial aircraft operations landing slots at Washington National Airport iii) reconsider "scattered flight" take off and landing patterns for this airport iv) consider stricter day-time restrictions on decibel levels; and (v) consider a night-time curfew from 10:00 p.~n. to 6:00 a.m. on commercial aircraft operations m) ADDITIOI~IAL PUBLIC ACTIOblS 1)(A) Actions by the Zoning Commission and Board of Zoning Adjustment must include consideration of limits on light pollution that affects one of Ward 3’s important occupants: the U.S. Naval Observatory B) District government officials should review applicable regulations to ensure that light pollution does not affect the Naval Observatory unnecessarily 2) Graffiti is a major source of visual pollution that cannot be tolerated, and its elimination must be a priority 3) District government officials must exercise flexibility in the standards required for street/gutter/curb/sidewalk improvements. This flexibility should meet the need for such improvements while respecting the environment (as opposed to inflexibility that only meets the standards without regard to environmental effects For instance: design standards for rights-of-way adjacent to park land may have to be adapted to preserve open space and natural surfaces; and street resurfacing must include every effort to protect and revitalize public space trees whose roots and trunks could be cut or damaged 4) It is reasonable to conclude that reducing exposure to electromagnetic fields EMF at all points on the spectrum increases public safety. Doing nothing, while waiting for conclusive evidence about human health effects, is not a reasonable response to the potential risks associated with EMt~s. Because the vast majority of the ward’s land is zoned residential or is natural park land, District government officials must incorporate prudent avoidance in decisions regarding the approval, location or routing, and intensity of ]~M1~ generating facilities such as generators, power lines, and antennas in Ward 3 ’acilities should be located in the ward only when and where necessary, based on the local service needs of the ward’s property owners, and facilities should be designed using methods to mitigate, to the greatest extent practicable, involuntary exposures to the public and adverse effects on park land, public space, and private property SEC. 1200.305 TRANSPORTATION a) PREFACE. Except for the provision of bikeways, the transportation system is essentially in place in Ward 3. Improvements to both the physical infrastructure and the general functioning of the system are the issues of greatest concern and importance to residents and the District government. Traffic patterns in Ward 3 can be classified into two major categories: commuting to employment centers and travel within the ward. Commuter traffic originates both within the ward and in the suburbs to the north and west of the city. Radial streets are the primary commuter arteries; the major routes are Connecticut, Wisconsin and Massachusetts avenues, MacArthur Boulevard, and Canal Road. Much of the intra-ward traffic is either school-related (drop off and pick up of children) or shopping (e.g Saturday congestion on Wisconsin Avenue This intra-ward traffic explains why counterflow volume on 160 ENROLLED ORIGINAL Wisconsin Avenue, unlike other typical commuter arteries, is high during peak periods. An important characteristic of the street system is that all but one of the streets are residential; the exception is Wisconsin Avenue which is substantially (but not entirely) commercial. Commercial land use is largely located on the arterials. Moreover, throughout the ward commercial uses tend to be small business/neighborhood shops, and, except for Wisconsin Avenue, the commercial uses are concentrated in nodes separated by long segments of residential use. These facts complicate transportation planning: major changes to facilitate traffic adversely affect either nearby residents or small businesses. The transportation system includes a segment of the Metrorail system (Red Line) which traverses the ward following a route running under portions of Connecticut and Wisconsin Avenues. The 5 Ward 3 stations are: Woodley Park/Zoo, Cleveland Park, Van Ness/UDC, Tenleytown/AU, and Friendship Heights. Metrobus connections with Metrorail appear generally acceptable. However, the frequency of Metrobus service is an issue of importance, especially to the many elderly residents. Bikeways comprise a small component of Ward 3~s transportation system. A plan to promote the use of bicycles in the city was prepared in 1976 and revised in 1987. It was based on 3 goals: to improve bicycle accessibility to major activity centers; to promote bicycle safety; and to improve bicycle parking facilities. At the present time the bikeway network in Ward 3 includes off-street routes bisecting the ward from north to south, 1 connecting the northern part of the ward to l~ock Creek Park, and another on Beach Drive in Rock Creek Park. Increased traffic and inadequate parking are intrinsic to most planning and development issues in Ward 3. Very few of the streets were designed or built to efficiently handle the current, heavy traffic volumes, and the results are congestion and spillover of traffic onto local and secondary feeder streets. To facilitate traffic flow, on-street parking is removed, even though there already is a lack of adequate parking in some commercial areas. A result is commercial parking spillover onto residential streets. These spillovers threaten the quality of residential life in the ward. As new and larger structures replace older and smaller ones through the redevelopment process, existing traffic problems are exacerbated. The 1986 Wisconsin Avenue Corridor Study offers some indication as to how traffic problems along major arteries in the ward may be addressed. For Wisconsin Avenue, the study suggested a number of zoning changes to reduce the potential increases in traffic from commercial development. The Land Use Element recognizes the ward as an already built environment, in part because the surface transportation infrastructure cannot handle substantial increases in land use density. Parking accommodations are another problem. A major success is the residential permit parking program. However, the need for parking facilities near some of the wardWs Metrorail stations needs to be examined. The illegal parking of tour busses and other vehicles in residential areas and on bridges needs to be eliminated. While adequate parking must be provided with all new structures, authorities must recognize that many individuals avoid garages; garage designs should seek to overcome this aversion b) RELATION OF WARD 3 TO THE DECLARATION OF MAJOR POLICIES IN THE TRANSPORTATION ELEMENT OF THE COMPREHENSIVE PLAN. ENROLLED ORIGINAL 1) The ward’s transportation network meets the diverse needs of those who reside in, work in, or visit the District, but this network can and should be improved, particularly through increased Metrobus frequencies and better transportation management. The ward’s bikeways are inadequate and must be improved as a commuter alternative to the automobile 2) Ward 3 mostly meets the District’s need for land set aside for transportation-related uses. The ward has a completed highway system for motor vehicle traffic. It has 5 Metrorail stations, Metrobus terminals at Van Ness/UDC and at Chevy Chase Circle, and the Friendship Heights Metrobus garage. However, land use needs include better parking facilities at certain commercial nodes and at some Metrorail stations 3) The transportation system (e.g Metrobus service) should be improved for the ward’s elderly population. Automobile transit is not at an acceptable standard in terms of providing smooth flow, having adequate parking (commercial especially and not impacting residential streets 4) Providing "amenities" by meeting the needs of pedestrians and encouraging bicyclists is particularly important for Ward 3 5) Ward 3 is directly affected by the District’s commitment to finding regional solutions to transit-related issues. Inter-jurisdictional cooperation needs to be improved for issues relating to Friendship Heights 6) Ward 3 is primarily a residential ward, and is not targeted in the Comprehensive Plan as a location for significant economic development (except for 3 housing opportunity areas Because of this, and because of the already-built nature of the ward’s transportation system, transportation impacts must be a critical factor in the review of development plans and approval of building permits 7) Improving the level of service at street intersections to "B or "C" at worst, is important for the protection and improvement of the quality of life, air quality, and residential character of the ward c) GENERAL OBJECTIVES AND POLICIES FOR TRANSPORTATION 1) The District government should A) Implement appropriate land use arrangements in Ward 3 that simplify and economize transportation services such as i) More dense commercial use (where designated in the Land Use Element) should be within one-half mile of a Metrorail station; and (ii) medium and high density residential uses (where designated in the Land Use element) should be limited to the major arterials well-served by either Metrorail or Metrobus B) Expand the residential parking permit program, and develop parking controls for areas heavily impacted by visitors (such as near the Washington Sheraton and Omni Shoreham hotels, American University and the University of the District of Columbia, the National Zoo, and the Washington National Cathedral and C) Provide adequate short-term parking, either on or off street as appropriate, to serve the ward’s 17 local, multi-neighborhood, and regional commercial centers 2)(A) Traffic mitigation strategies should avoid removal of parking which serves residents or retail customers. The strategies 162 ENROLLED ORIGINAL should also avoid the completion of the highway plan where the new construction will disrupt existing green space B) Traffic mitigation strategies must include measures enabling pedestrian movement, such as by making crosswalks safe, well marked, and with adequate time for crossing (especially in areas with concentrated populations of the elderly w(C) For all major projects, including Planned Unit Developments, special exceptions, and Large Tract Review projects of moderate and greater density and for major chancery expansions, the government should require traffic mitigation studies (e.g as required for Square 1661 in Zoning Commission orders 517, 519, and 528 3) The District government should require that all off-street loading for new major commercial and residential buildings utilize private space to the greatest extent possible (i.e to avoid an impact on public space, including dedicated but unbuilt streets) and encourage the use of below-grade, through-block connectors (e.g as at Square 1661) as an amenity for large commercial or mixed-use development projects 4)(A) Public parking should be expanded through options such as (i) public garages or (ii) easements with private developers for the construction of public parking in private buildings for the Glover Park and Wisconsin/Van Ness commercial districts. On-street public parking should not be diminished at any of the wardls commercial districts B) The increase in off-street parking lot variances in residential zones where the lots serve nearby commercial establishments should be discouraged 5) The expansion of public parking through options such as (i) public garages or (ii) easements with private developers for the construction of public parking in private buildings and the provision of reliable bicycle storage facilities at all of the ward’s Metrorail station areas would enhance the DistrictVs policy for an intermodal transportation system 6) For all major development projects, including Planned Unit Developments, special exceptions, and Large Tract Review projects of moderate and greater density (10 DCMR 2300 and for major chancery expansions, the government should require a transportation system management TSM’) program that shall prevent any deterioration in the level of service of affected intersections below ’C" and that may, as a project amenity, improve existing levels of service at these intersections. Iv(7) For all major development projects, including Planned Unit Developments, special exceptions, and Large Tract Review projects of moderate and greater density (10 DCMR 2300 and for major chancery expansions, the government should require i) the provision of facilities for people choosing to bicycle to and from work; and either ii) an employee transportation management program (for commercial projects only to include, at a minimum, public transit incentives; or (iii) a shuttle service program for elderly or disabled groups (residential and institutional projects d) OBJECTIVES AND POLICIES FOR MASS TRANSIT. ’(1) The District government should require public transit incentives for Planned Unit Developments, Large Tract Review projects, and any other projects of moderate or greater density in the ward. This policy is intended to dovetail with the Ward 3 plan~s objective that 163 ENROLLED ORIGINAL moderate and medium density land usage is located where public transit is most accessible 2) The existing Metrobus routes within the ward are generally desirable. An improvement would be to expand the Connecticut Avenue "L" route service frequency to and from Chevy Chase Circle. This would eliminate the multi-modal trips which are particularly difficult for the elderly residents concentrated along this corridor. Bus service should also be improved along MacArthur Boulevard, and attention should be given to providing more buses on the "D" bus routes 3) The District government should institute shuttle and minibus service, with a focus on serving the elderly population which is concentrated along the Connecticut Avenue and Cathedral Avenue corridors e) OBJECTIVES AND POLICIES FOR PRIVATE PASSENGER AUTOMOBILES (INCLUDING ALTERNATIVE MODES} 1) Improve levels of service at intersections to ’C" or better 2)(A) Provide secure bicycle lockers or racks at each of the ward’s Metrorail stations as a means of encouraging residents to bicycle rather than drive to the stations B) Provide bicycle lanes on Connecticut, Wisconsin, and Massachusetts Avenues, and on MacArthur Boulevard C) Improve bicycle access to Rock Creek Park, especially at the Calvert/Shoreham hill f) OBJECTIVES AND POLICIES IN SUPPORT OF STREETS AND ALLEYS 1 The preference for dedicated but unimproved rights-of-way in Ward 3 is that they be used as park land. ’I(2) Use affirmative signage to direct trucks and buses; in addition to the traditional ’Do Not Enter" signs, use "Truck Route" signs and the like to direct commercial traffic in certain areas such as around the Sheraton and Shoreham hotels and the Washington National Cathedral. Limit tour buses to arterials and some minor arterials; discourage them from using local streets 3) Synchronize traffic signals and post the optimal speed on Wisconsin Avenue (favoring the peak and counterflow simultaneously and the other arterials (favoring the peak flow both to facilitate traffic and to minimize the deleterious environmental effects of idling motor vehicles on adjacent residential areas 4) Between midnight and 6:00 a.m most traffic signals other than on Wisconsin and Connecticut avenues should be flashing amber or red 5) Adequate measures should be taken at the local, multi-neighborhood, and regional centers to facilitate pedestrian crossings: diagonal pavement striping, audible indicators (particularly at Wisconsin/Newark, Tenleytown, Connecticut/Van Ness, Connecticut/Nebraska, and Connecticut/Chevy Chase, which are near concentrations of elderly people signage, signal timing, etc 6) The Department of Public Works street classification scheme for arterials, minor arterials, collectors, and feeder streets shall be depicted by the Department on a map of the ward that shall be made available to the public. 164 ENROLLED ORIGINAL 7) The existing "tear drop" pendant-globe street lamps should be retained (except on those streets in Woodley Park utilizing the "Washington Globe" lamp) and low-pressure sodium lighting should be reconsidered for use both for aesthetics and to minimize light pollution affecting the U.S. Naval Observatory 8) Minimize traffic congestion, with its concomitant adverse environmental effects including noise and air pollution; levels of service should be "C" or better 9) The Department of Public Works should try innovative techniques to control speeding on collector and local streets: consider "Seattle Circles rumble strips, speed bumps, median "islands etc. 1,(g) reserved h) OBJECTIVES AND POLICIES FOR WATERFRONT TRANSPORTATION. The old railroad right-of-way formerly owned by CSX which traverses the Palisades should be developed and maintained for recreation purposes, excluding rail i) OBJECTIVES AND POLICIES FOR PUBLIC ACTION 1) Identify all dedicated but unbuilt public rights-of-way in Ward 2) Create a Maryland/District inter-jurisdictional task force to review and coordinate land use and transportation system decision-making in the Friendship Heights area 3) Identify locations for taxicab stands (in addition to being near or at hotels) to promote the taxicab policies of the Comprehensive Plan 4) Consult with neighborhood organizations to identify and analyze cut-through problems; then implement appropriate mitigating measures such as diverters, restricted access, etc 5) Monitor the changes made along Reno Road/34th Street as a result of a 1983 DPW-commissioned study and recent additional changes, and determine whether further or different measures are needed 6) Update the Wisconsin and Connecticut corridor studies (done by the Office of Planning in 1986 and 1987 7) Prepare or obtain transportation studies for each of the ward’s 17 local, multi-neighborhood, and regional commercial centers 8) Include as a standard aspect of any street improvement project in Ward 3 an analysis of the need for, and the best way to provide for, bicycle transportation (e.g by pavement markings, signage, or pavement widening 9) Evaluate the feasibility of establishing HOV (high occupancy vehicle) lanes on Connecticut, Massachusetts, and Wisconsin avenue s SEC. 1200. 306 PUBLIC FACILITIES a) PREFACE. The public facilities in the ward enable essential services to be available to all members of the community. These facilities include public schools, recreation centers, libraries, police and fire stations, and general public works such as the storm and sanitary sewer system, the Dalecarlia Reservoir and Filtration Plant, and the Fort Reno tteservoir There are 11 public schools in Ward 3, all relatively old buildings. The 1992-93 student occupancy figures (according to the Committee on 165 ENROLLED ORIGINAL Public Education) are: Eaton Elementary School (103 Hearst Elementary School (107 Janney Elementary School (98 Key Elementary School (92 Lafayette Elementary School (112~o Mann Elementary School (121 Murch Elementary School (87 Oyster Elementary School (116 Stoddert Elementary School (127 Deal Junior High School (934 and Wilson Senior High School (107 The Public School System states that its official capacity figures may be high, and therefore a school with student occupancy 80 percent or greater is considered fully utilized The ward hosts the University of the District of Columbia, established in 1977. The UDC/Van Ness campus serves students from throughout the city and is located adjacent to the Van Ness Metrorail station on Connecticut Avenue. The ward, like the city, is served by a dual recreation system, the bulk of which is owned and managed by the National Park Service, and a portion owned and managed by the D.C. Department of Recreation and Parks. The federal systemTs parks comprise approximately half of the ward’s acreage and include: Rock Creek Park (and tributary valleys such as Normanstone Parkway, Klingle Valley, Melvin C. Hazen Park, Soapstone Valley Park, and Pinehurst Parkway Zoological Park, Glover Parkway and ChildrenWs Playground (commonly known as Glover-Archbold Park Whitehaven Parkway, Battery-Kemble Park, the C &amp;amp; O Canal, and Fort Bayard. Several of these parks are components of the Fort Circle Park system. In contrast, the District*s recreational park system includes some 134 acres in Ward 3, out of a city-wide total of 1,337 acres The Department of Recreation and Parks~ facilities include: 1 community center (Chevy Chase Community Center on Connecticut Avenue at McKinley Street 1 indoor pool at Wilson Senior High School; 1 senior citizen center (Regency House on Connecticut Avenue at Chevy Chase Parkway 8 recreation centers (Chevy Chase Playground at 41st and Livingston Streets/ Friendship Recreation Center at 45th Street and Massachusetts Avenue; Guy Mason Recreation Center at Wisconsin Avenue and Calvert Street; Hearst Recreation Center at 37th and Quebec Streets; Lafayette Recreation Center at 33rd and Patterson Streets; Macomb Playground at 34th and Macomb Streets; Palisades Recreation Center at Sherier Place and Dana Place; and Stoddert Playground at 39th and Calvert Streets and playgrounds or tennis courts in Forest ttills (32nd and Brandywine Streets McLean Gardens (39th and Newark Streets) and at Fort Reno (41st and Chesapeake Streets There is one regional public library (Chevy Chase) and three branch public libraries (Cleveland Park, Palisades, and Tenley Friendship The headquarters for the Second District of the Metropolitan Police Department is located on Idaho Avenue at Newark Street; it was built in 1974. The Second District includes not only all of the ward but portions of wards 1 and 2 as well. There are four fire stations located in Ward 3: Cleveland Park (Connecticut Avenue near Porter Street Forest Hills (Connecticut Avenue and Ellicott Street Tenley Circle (Wisconsin Avenue and Warren Street and Palisades (MacArthur Blvd. at Reservoir Road. Each station has an engine company. All but Forest ttills has a truck company (aerial ladder truck Tenley Circle has an ambulance (basic life support unit and ]~orest Hills an advanced life support unit as well as Rescue Squad No. 4 (a rescue truck For Ward 3 the major issues regarding public facilities focus on the continuing need for rehabilitation and maintenance 166 ENROLLED ORIGINAL of the facilities, the need to improve accessibility for the elderly and the disabled; and the desire for general improvement. TT(b) RELATION OF I~ARD 3 TO THE DECLARATION OF MAJOR POLICIES IN THE PUBLIC FACILITIES ELEMENT OF THE COMPREHENSIVE PLAN. TT(1) Ward 3 shares in the city-wide need for improvements to its public facilities A) an aging infrastructure of water and sewer mains, storm sewers, highways, and bridges; I~(B) stormwater management projects that can improve the Ward 3 environment, particularly the quality of its park lands; and C) several fire stations that need renovation or enlargement (that must be sensitive to existing architectural qualities 2) Public facilities planning for Ward 3 does not require the same degree of attention to economic development objectives as may be desired for other wards, since substantial new economic development is not a a planning goal for the ward. However, attention to the neighborhood improvement objective is critical; a case in point is the ongoing failure of the public schools to provide adequate classroom capacity c) PUBLIC FACILITIES GOALS 1) The Ward 3 public facilities goal is to provide adequate public facilities in good condition to support low-cost delivery of municipal programs and services 2) Public facilities planning for Ward 3 must be sensitive to the retention of green space, compatible in use and scale, respect architectural qualities, including historic district and landmark protections, and be consistent with the Comprehensive Plan d) OBJECTIVES AND POLICIES FOR ADEQUATE SERVICE DELIVERY IIn addition to the city-wide objective and policies stated in the Public Facilities Element 1) Given the development pressures in the ward, and the absence of need for the city to provide development incentives in Ward 3, the burden for financing infrastructure improvement should be placed whenever possible on the developer or prelect necessitating the improvements 2) Existing public facilities should be improved A) Public schools require improved maintenance (both corrective and preventative) and physical capacity must be increased to meet student demand B) The public libraries require physical renovation, improved resources to expand their collections, and should have expanded hours of operation C) l~ecreation centers should have expanded hours of staffing. Where appropriate, and without neighborhood objection, improve lighting and make other provision for nighttime activities. All recreation centers should have functioning lavatories and drinking fountains D) Recreational grounds should be created or expanded physically where and when feasible to accommodate demand for field games such as soccer, softball, etc There is no field available for regulation 167 ENROLLED ORIGINAL baseball This policy should not be accomplished through the conversion of existing natural park land E) The ward’s public pool facilities are inadequate. The one indoor pool is usually in some state of disrepair. An outdoor pool should be established for children’s summer enjoyment F) Police service delivery should be expanded, recognizing that while the ward has a low violent crime rate relative to other wards its level of property crime is the highest in the city; inadequate law enforcement unnecessarily increases the cost of living (e.g insurance, property protection devices, etc for residents G) The renovation or upgrading of fire and emergency service facilities should occur on-site or on adjacent land acquired for this purpose (and must be sensitive to existing architectural qualities H) All storm and sanitary sewers should be separated. Particular care should be taken to minimize environmental damage. Foundry Branch (in Glover-Archbold Park) should be restored to its natural stream bed e) OBJECTIVE AND POLICIES IN SUPPORT OF ADEQUATE PLANNING FOR PUBLIC FACILITIES 1) There should be a Ward 3 component of the District-wide public facilities plan that is to be developed 2) The Ward 3 public facilities plan shall ensure an adequate correlation between public facilities and the service delivery needs of the ward’s population including the significant elderly population f) Reserved g) OBJECTIVE AND POLICIES STIMULATING DEVELOPMENT While the ward of course, needs adequate pubic facilities to ensure an acceptable level of delivery of ~nunicipal programs and services, the ward is sufficiently built and stable, and therefore the District does not need to consider stimulating development as a factor in providing public facilities in the ward h) OBJECTIVE AND POLICIES FOR THE LOCATION OF PUBLIC FAUILITIES 1) In the decision-making to locate public facilities, there shall be a presumption that open space land should be retained or increased for park or recreational purposes. Park land that is in natural condition should not be built upon, even for recreational purposes 2) All proposals for new construction, replacement, or reuse of public facilities shall be consistent with the Comprehensive Plan SEC. 1200.307 URBAN DESIGN a) PREFACE. Urban design is an aspect of public and private activity that can significantly contribute to the quality of life in the urban environment. Urban design takes many forms: building architecture (e.g design compatibility and sensitivity of scale treatment of public space such as sidewalk materials (e.g brick or concrete location of utility lines, street light styles, signage, and the selection of street furniture; treatment of parks and open spaces; maintenance of environmental quality; and transition of land uses between geographical areas. The importance of these factors on quality of life means urban design must be included in decision making. Ward 3 has numerous features which fix its character. Of particular note are the 10 special streets (designated pursuant to the ttistoric Preservation Element, they 168 ENROLLED ORIGINAL are: Beach Drive, Broad Branch Road, Canal Road, Chain Bridge, Connecticut Avenue, MacArthur Boulevard, Massachusetts Avenue, Rock Creek and Potomac parkways, Western Avenue, and Wisconsin Avenue the two Historic Districts (Cleveland Park and Old Woodley Park the 17 commercial centers designated in the Land Use Element (including a regional center at Friendship Heights, multi-neighborhood centers at Connecticut/Van Ness and Wisconsin/Albemarle, and 14 local neighborhood centers 5 on Connecticut Avenue, 4 on Wisconsin Avenue, 3 on MacArthur Boulevard, and 1 each on Massachusetts and New Mexico Avenues the few large estates remaining from earlier eras (such as 18th century Rosedale, 19th century Twin Oaks, and early 20th century Tregaron in Cleveland Park and a substantial park system (including Rock Creek Park (and tributary valleys such as Normanstone Parkway, Klingle Valley, Melvin C. Hazen Park, Soapstone Valley Park, and Pinehurst Parkway Zoological Park, Glover Parkway and Childrenls Playground (commonly known as Glover Archbold Park Whitehaven Parkway, Battery-Kemble Park, the C &amp;amp; O Canal, and Fort Bayard Continuing development in Ward 3 requires conscious consideration of urban design to ensure that the quality of life is maintained or improved. Factors such as pedestrian amenities, streetscape design, compatibility and sensitivity to the scale of existing buildings, maintenance of environmental quality, integration of new development with existing area or neighborhood character, and transitions between land uses are all areas of concern in Ward 3 b) RELATION OF WARD 3 TO THE DECLARATION OF MAJOR POLICIES IN THE URBAN DESIGN ELEMENT OF THE COMPREHENSIVE PLAN 1) Areas of Ward 3 that deserve special attention to urban design issues include: the special streets, historic districts, the immediate environs of the numerous individual historic landmarks and sites, the commercial centers, and any areas with significant environmental or topographical features including the Palisades, Woodland-Normanstone, Tenleytown and Fort Reno, and Forest Hills 2) Ward 3 includes significant waterfront along the Potomac palisades. Yet Wfuture design and development" of this waterfront should essentially be no more than the maintenance (and possible expansion) of this existing natural park land, which includes a limited number of hiking and biking trails 3) Many of the Wardls distinct neighborhoods e.g American. University Park, Cathedral Heights, Chevy Chase, Cleveland Park, Forest Hills, Fort Gaines, Foxhall, Friendship Heights, Glover Park, Kent, Massachusetts Avenue Heights, McLean Gardens, Observatory, Palisades, Spring Valley, Wesley Heights, Woodland-Normanstone, and Woodley Park embody architectural features which deserve protection and design assistance to ensure that the maintenance of these neighborhoods preserves their identity and contribution to the National Capital environment 4) Land use and future development must be carefully controlled to protect the existing scale and low density character, and to enhance the maintenance and improvement of existing natural open spaces and other qualities of the ward. VV(c) URBAN DESIGN GOAL. 169 EtiROLLEO ORIGIHAL "It is the urban design goal of this ward plan to promote the protection, enhancement, and enjoyment of the natural environs and to ensure that the artificial environment provides visual orientation, enhances the District’s aesthetic qualities, emphasizes neighborhood identities, and is functionally efficient. The efficient and sensitive use of land will capitalize upon and amplify the ward’s best features d) URBAN DESIGN OBJECTIVE AND POLICIES The policy established in support of the urban design objectives is to i) strengthen and enhance the ward’s character as a residential base of the city with neighborhood-serving commercial centers ii) protect and enhance the distinguishable physical qualities of Ward 3 neighborhoods iii) respect natural features, and maintain and expand open spaces and park land; and (iv) enhance the several national and international attractions within the ward el OBJECTIVE AND POLICIES FOR THE NATURAL ENVIRONMENT, AREAS WITH SEVERE BUILDING RESTRAINTS, AND STREAMS AND STREAM VALLEYS 1) Areas in Ward 3 that are environmentally valuable and sensitive to urban development include the following A) Fort Reno and Tenleytown: the highest point of land in the western part of the city, this area is topographically significant and therefore all building designs should be carefully considered in terms of vistas of and from this area B) The palisades: rising above the Potomac River, the palisades are an important feature both topographically and as a largely wooded area with low density residential above the canal. Urban design should respect and perpetuate the low density, wooded character of the built area, and avoid detrimental impact on the natural park land C) Dalecarlia Reservoir grounds: a heavily wooded tract that is environmentally important because of its large land area and proximity to the Potomac River. It is unlikely to see development, which is consistent with the goals and objectives of this plan D) U.S. Naval Observatory grounds: an area with much open space and some woods, which is proximate to park land (Normanstone Parkway and Dumbarton Oaks Park) is an environmentally valuable area. The Observatory is particularly vulnerable to development in the ward: nearby development creates heat which atmospherically distorts observations; and development even somewhat distant creates light pollution that artificially clouds astrometrical observation. Urban design must respect and not exacerbate these problems El Stream valleys, which include Rock Creek Park (and its tributaries) and Glover Archbold Park. Development adjacent to these parks must be low density and shall be further restricted where advisable to protect unstable soils, eliminate runoff potential, and promote a green buffer between the built environment and these natural settings. Development of border areas must avoid any adverse effect (known or plausibly suspected) on these stream valley parks, including the water quality, flora, and fauna, and should minimize any intrusion on views from these parks F) Neighborhoods developed over hilly terrain or near stream valleys (such as Barnaby Woods, Forest Hills, Hawthorne, Palisades, Spring Valley, and Woodland-Normanstone Urban design 170 ENROLLED ORIGINAL should respect and perpetuate the natural features, low density, and usually wooded character of these built areas G) The ~4ard 3 portions of the Fort Circle Park System, and other park land such as V~hitehaven Parkway, are environmentally valuable and sensitive areas that must be protected and enhanced through sensitive urban design 2) Appropriate design solutions include A) Limit density of development adjacent to natural areas, areas with severe building restraints, or stream valleys; maintain park-like settings on streets and lands adjacent to the natural areas and stream valleys; and require ample building set-backs B) Permit design flexibility to allow the clustering or concentration of housing which, in turn, allows other areas to remain natural with no overall increase in density C) Commercial use should not be introduced to areas where none is now present D) For park land, restrict on-site development; there should be very little building of structures (e.g recreational facilities such as offices, amphitheaters, athletic courts) on natural park land E) Encourage retention of natural growth and grades; minimize regrading or the removal of topsoil and vegetation; and establish new vegetation, especially trees; and F) Minimize the construction of impervious surfaces; promote permeable materials for driveways, walkways, parking lots, and the like G) No streams in the ward should be channeled or culverted. Separate the combined sewer in Glover Archbold Park; removing Foundry Branch from the sewer would significantly improve the environmental quality of this park f) Reserved g) Reserved h) OBJECTIVE AND POLICIES FOR STREETSCAPE 1) Strengthen the image and design cohesiveness of the ward’s commercial nodes, particularly along Connecticut and Wisconsin Avenues, and MacArthur Boulevard. This can be done by direct government action, but is more likely to be accomplished if the government encourages, sanctions, and supports streetscape plans developed for each node by community organizations (which may be local business associations, civic groups, ANCs, etc Streetscape plans may include building design standards, should include beautification (i.e landscaping and should provide that signage and furniture are compatible with the architectural character of the locale 2) Governmental actions must ensure that pedestrian movement is easy, especially at those commercial nodes serving the ward’s significant elderly population. Pedestrian movement may be impeded by the placement of street furniture, a concentration of street vendors, a large sidewalk care that leaves inadequate sidewalk space, and so forth 3) The design of sidewalk cafes must be compatible with the architectural qualities of the commercial node. Given the low-density character of Ward 3, new sidewalk cafes should be unenclosed and their furniture must be removed during the colder months when the cafes are unlikely to operate. 171 I[HROLLED ORIGINAL 4) The "tear drop" style streetlight luminaires should be retained on the ward’s residential streets, and restored where possible on those local streets where they have been removed since 1990 5) Development or redevelopment at any of the ward’s commercial areas must be oriented toward the street, with off-street parking to be provided in the rear or below grade but not between the structure and the street i) OBJECTIVES AND POLICIES FOR AREAS OF STRONG ARCHITECTURAL CHARACTER OF STABLE CHARACTER 1) The following design guidelines are the policy for Ward 3 V(A) Height: Relate the overall height of new construction (including additions) to that of adjacent structures. As a general rule, construct new buildings to a height roughly equal to the average height of existing buildings. Avoid new construction which greatly varies in height (too high or too low) from older buildings in the vicinity B) Scale: Relate the size and proportions of new construction to the scale of adjacent buildings. New construction should maintain the scale of existing buildings, regardless of size. Avoid new construction which in height, width, or massing violates the existing scale of the area C) Massing: Break up uninteresting box-like forms into smaller, varied masses. Variety of form and massing are elements essential to the character of the streetscape. Avoid single, monolithic forms which are not relieved by variations in massing. Box-like facades and forms are intrusive when placed in a streetscape of older buildings which have varied massing and facade articulation. VW(D) Directional expression: Relate the vertical, horizontal, or non-directional facade character of new construction to the predominant directional expression of nearby buildings. Horizontal buildings can be made to relate to the more vertical adjacent structures by breaking the facade into smaller masses which conform to the primary expression of the streetscape. Avoid strongly horizontal or vertical facade expressions unless compatible with the character of structures in the immediate area E) Setback: Maintain the historic facade lines of streetscapes by locating front walls of new construction in the same plane as the facades of adjacent buildings. If exceptions are made, buildings should be set back into the lot rather than closer to the street. If existing setbacks vary, new buildings should conform to historic siting patterns. Avoid violating the existing setback pattern by placing new construction in front of or behind the historic facade line. Avoid placing buildings at odd angles to the street, unless in an area where diverse siting already exists, even if proper setback is maintained F) Roof shapes: Relate the roof forms of new construction to those found in the area. Although not entirely necessary, duplication of the existing or traditional roof shapes, pitches and materials on new construction is one way of making new structures more visually compatible. Avoid introducing roof shapes, pitches, or materials not traditionally used in the area G) Rhythm of openings: Respect the recurrent alternation of wall areas with door and window elements in the facade. 172 ENROLLED ORIGINAL Also consider the width-to-height ratio of any bays. The placement of openings with respect to the facade’s overall composition, symmetry, or balanced asymmetry should be carefully studied. Avoid introducing incompatible facade patterns which upset the rhythm of openings established in surrounding structures H) Material 1) Use building materials that match or harmonize with the materials predominant in the area or adjacent structures 2) Commercial development and high density residential adjacent to residential districts, particularly low-density, must provide buffers to mitigate adverse effects (which may include the shadows, noise, odors, traffic congestion, etc 3) Encourage the renovation and adaptive re-use of existing structures rather than demolition in Ward 3 4) As a general rule it is inappropriate to erect fences or walls in front yards. The residential neighborhoods of Ward 3 are characterized by open spaces and building set backs 5) Superior design is a prerequisite amenity for all development projects in the ward that are reviewed through the Planned Unit Development or R-5-A processes of the Zoning Regulations or through the Large Tract Review (10 DCMR 2300 6) The Historic Preservation Review Board may review and make recommendations on the design of new development in local neighborhood centers adjacent to one of the ward’s historic districts j) Reserved k) Reserved 1) ADDITIONAL PUBLIC ACTIONS 1) The Office of Planning should consider zoning techniques that might break up the generally continuous commercial appearance of Wisconsin Avenue and create a greater sense of the commercial areas being distinct nodes, as is the case on the other major avenues in Ward 3 2) The Shipstead-Luce Act should be amended to permit review by the Commission of Fine Arts of development adjacent to Glover Archbold Park 3) District government officials must exercise flexibility in the standards required for street/gutter/curb/sidewalk improvements. Such flexibility should meet the need for such improvements while respecting the environment (as opposed to inflexibility that only meets the standards without regard to environmental effects For instance: design standards for rights-of-way adjacent to park land may have to be adapted to preserve open space and natural surfaces; street resurfacing must include every effort to protect and revitalize public space trees whose roots and trunks could be cut or damaged 4) Map the Tree &amp;amp; Slope Protection overlay (11 DCMR 1511) in hilly areas throughout the ward in addition to Woodland-Normanstone 5) Reevaluate the types of trees specified for public space along the major arterial streets of the ward; slow growing species may not be optimal for these heavily trafficked highways. Maintenance of public space trees and prompt disease removal must be improved 6) Ensure that master plans, project plans, public facilities, and capital improvements for Ward 3 are consistent with the policies with the Urban Design Element and this ward plan. 173 "SEC. 1200.308 PRESERVATION AND HISTORIC FEATURES a) PREFACE. Parts of what is now Ward 3 grew outward from the city of Georgetown in the late 18th century. Settlements grew along the roads that were built between farms and the port. One of the first settlements was at the juncture of Georgetown Pike (now Wisconsin Avenue) and River Road, where there was a to]] station. Around 1790, John Tenna]]y opened a tavern at the intersection, giving his name to the area we now call Tenleytown. Farming dominated the area until the beginning of the 20th century. One major land owner, Colonel Joseph Belt, named his estate Chevy Chase. The area just north of Tenleytown and adjacent to Fort Reno was occupied primarily by former slaves who came north after the Civil War in search of homes and land. Dubbed Reno City, it remained a predominantly black community until 1928, when the National Park Service bought the land around Fort Reno for a new water reservoir. In 1931-35 the District acquired some of the land for Deal Junior High School and Wilson Senior High School. Most of the houses were razed by 1939. Construction of a bridge over the Rock Creek Valley enabled Connecticut Avenue to be extended and, therefore, much of what is Ward 3 to be developed as suburb to the city of Washington. In 1890, Senators William Steward and Francis Newlands founded the Chevy Chase Land Company. The company was responsible for extending Connecticut Avenue into Montgomery County, building a trolley line, and developing Chevy Chase into a residential community. A transportation route also led to development in the area adjacent to the Potomac River. The C &amp;amp; O Canal was completed in 1843, providing transport between Georgetown and Harper’s Ferry. A parallel roadway, Conduit Road (now MacArthur Boulevard) led to the city’s Potomac River water intake near Great Falls, and stimulated the gradual development of residential estates along the palisades. Structures throughout Ward 3 are relatively new compared to the average age of structures in the original city of Washington. There are, however, a number of old and historic structures, as well as classes of structures such as apartment buildings and bridges, that have been designated or present possibilities for historic designation. Historic areas or features in Ward 3 include: Rock Creek Park, Glover Archbold Park, the Chesapeake and Ohio Canal the Fort Circle Park System, the bridges over Rock Creek valley (Glover, Taft, and Ellington the Washington National Cathedral, the Twin Oaks, Tregaron, and Rosedale estates in Cleveland Park, the Carnegie Department of Terrestial Magnetism on Broad Branch Road, the Babcock-Macomb House on Massachusetts Avenue, the Pine Crest/Greystone/Klingle Mansion cluster of houses near Rock Creek, the Cathedral Mansions, Kennedy-Warren, Ponce de Leon, and Alban Towers apartment buildings, the Chevy Chase arcade, and the Spring Valley Shopping Center. The Cleveland Park historic district was listed on the National Register of Historic Places on May 8, 1987. The Old Woodley Park historic district was listed on the National Register of Historic Places on June 15, 1990. Preservation of the ward’s historic resources landmarks, districts, and places, whether or not officially designated strengthens the historic integrity of the ward, maintains the ward’s existing character, and preserves Ward 3 as an attractive and desirable part of the city in which to live b) PRESERVATION AND HISTORIC FEATURES GOAL The goal of historic preservation in Ward 3 is to preserve important historic 174 ENROLLED ORIGINAL features, especially (but not exclusively) those that have been registered under local or federal preservation laws, while ensuring that any new development that may occur in the ward is responsive, sensitive, and compatible with these features c) RELATION OF WARD 3 TO THE OBJECTIVES AND POLICIES OF THE PRESERVATION AND HISTORIC FEATURES ELEMENT OF THE COMPREHENSIVE PLAN 1) Ensuring the designation, protection, and enhancement of historic resources throughout Ward 3 can be accomplished by providing sustained regulatory, enforcement, and financial leadership. Coordinated public and private efforts can effectively respond to historic preservation issues in ways that will assure the continuity of the ward’s architectural and cultural history and the protection of those properties which contribute to the historic value of the area 2) Both the public sector (including the District government and the advisory neighborhood commissions) and private sector (including historical societies, business, and civic groups) should A) ensure the identification and designation, of Ward 3’s historic resources B) protect and enhance the architectural qualities and historic character of residential neighborhoods and designated commercial centers in Ward 3 C) foster broad community participation in historic preservation; increase awareness of the ward’s history and its historic resources; develop literature and activities to accomplish this; encourage organizations and individuals to undertake preservation by private means D) seek ways and means to provide regulatory, technical, and financial support and encouragement to owners of historic properties to ensure the retention and maintenance of such properties and sites; seek to make changes in regulations or public policies which may impede historic preservation efforts E) monitor new construction and alteration of structures and the use, modification, or proposed demolition of landmarks, to ensure preservation and compatibility with historic resources in Ward 3 F) evaluate development proposals within or adjacent to an historic landmark or district to ensure that design is compatible with, and that there are no adverse impacts upon, the affected historic landmark or district; development must respect the character of a landmark or district through the appropriate use of materials, building scale, architectural detail, and other design characteristics; and G) evaluate development proposals within or adjacent to an historic landmark or district to ensure compliance with the urban design policies of this ward plan (see, especially, sec¢ion 1200.307 (i 3) Development adjacent to parks which are designated landmarks must be low density and shall be further restricted where advisable to protect unstable soils, eliminate runoff potential, and promote a green buffer between the built environment and these natural settings; development must avoid any adverse effect (known or plausibly suspected) on these landmarks, including the water quality, flora, and fauna, and should minimize any intrusion on views from these parks 4) Many of the apartment buildings along Connecticut Avenue, such a Cathedral Mansions, the Kennedy-Warren, and the 175 ENROLLED ORIGINAL Broadmoor, were built with great swaths of green space in front or large interior open spaces as a response to building style and the zoning regulations in the 1920s; where these open spaces are recognized to contribute to the integrity of the site or structure, stringent protection from inappropriate infill shall be maintained 5) Development upon, or redevelopment of the historic estates in Ward 3 shall be discouraged; ensure that the future use of these sites is compatible with these landmarks, respects and protects their historic integrity, and is consistent with their designation as historic landmarks 6) The District government must maintain the ward’s historic bridges, including the special design features that characterize these structures (e.g statuary, original style of fences or rails, lights and lighting, iron, and masonry work Safety improvements should be strictly scrutinized for need, compatibility, and effect on the structure’s historic integrity d) PUBLIC ACTION OBJECTIVE AND POLICIES 1) Protection of Ward 3’s existing historic features, regardless of whether officially designated, from incompatible development is essential. The strengthening of protective measures must be explored 2) Enforcement of preservation laws must be improved through increased inspections, the imposition of fines and, where warranted, prosecution, and an increase in penalties 3) The Office of Planning must monitor development proposals and construction permits to ensure preservation of the integrity of the ward’s historic resources 4) The Zoning Commission and the Board of Zoning Adjustment shall consider the effects of a pending application on the ward’s historic landmarks and districts, and shall consider any negative effects to constitute an adverse or detrimental impact 5) The District government should develop and publicize assistance programs and techniques to help lower- and fixed-income residents (especially the ward’s significant elderly population) maintain their property in accordance with historic district guidelines and standards 6) The Main Street program should be promoted as a means to enhance Ward 3’s local- and multi-neighborhood commercial centers 7) A comprehensive survey of Ward 3 historic resources is needed as a basis on which to expand historic preservation efforts and initiate appropriate actions to strengthen the historic integrity of the ward 8) The District government and the National Capital Planning Commission should consider designating Dalecarlia Parkway and Nebraska Avenue as Special Streets. SEC. 1200.309 HUMAN SEP~VICES a) PREFACE. Historically, publicly-funded social services delivery programs have been targeted to the ward’s elderly population. Seventeen percent are age 65 or older a decline from the 1980 census and now the second highest proportion in any ward of the city. Special attention, therefore, must be focused on the needs of the elderly. The service delivery programs of the District’s Office on Aging are especially important in Ward 3. Providing efficient and affordable human services 176 ENROLLED ORIGINAL requires intense, sustained, and sharply focused actions by the public and private sectors working closely together Because of the ward’s socio-economic characteristics, many other human service programs are directed much more intensively in other wards than in Ward 3. For example, food stamp program recipients in Ward 3 account for less than one percent of the District total. The Ward also accounts for a very small proportion of the city’s Aid to Families with Dependent Children (AFDC) and General Public Assistance cases (approximately 3% and 6 respectively Only six percent of the ward’s households are classified as in poverty; citywide the figure is 15 According to the records of the CBRF database, the only community-based residential facilities in Ward 3 include six health care facilities and 21 community residential facilities. Residents and religious institutions in the ward have in recent years established a number of small shelters for the ward’s homeless population, and the ward’s Community Council for the Homeless has employed a social worker to identify and work with this needy population. Other CBRF categories, such as youth care homes, youth and adult rehabilitation homes, and homes for substance abuse are non-existent in Ward 3. There are no mental health facilities in Ward 3. Instead, the ward is served by the Area A Community Health Center located in Georgetown. The District’s Department of Human Services (DHS) is the primary human service delivery agency and has the primary responsibility for implementing the Human Services Element of the Comprehensive Plan. DHS works in conjunction with other District agencies and private organizations to provide social, economic, and health support for people who cannot otherwise secure them. DHS has a geriatric health clinic at Regency House, 5201 Connecticut Avenue. Iona Services, located in Ward 3, plays a major role for the ward’s elderly population. Sibley Memorial Hospital, the Psychiatric Institute of Washington, the Washington Clinic, the Wisconsin Avenue Nursing Home, the Washington ttome, the Methodist Home, the Lisner-Louise tIome, Knollwood (formerly Distaff Hall and Friendship Terrace are other primary private providers of human services. The active involvement of community leaders and agencies, providers, and consumers is necessary to ensure that high quality, efficient, and affordable human services are provided. It is essential that programs and actions continue to respond to identified community needs in Ward 3. The human services recommendations address the on-going need for the responsive and timely provision of health and social services to all those in need in Ward 3. The public and private sectors must continue to focus attention on and improve social service programs and assistance in the ward b) HUMAN SERVICES DELIVERY SYSTEM OBJECTIVES ’(1) To improve, as necessary, the overall human services delivery system in Ward 3, with particular attention to the elderly and the mentally and physically disabled 2) To foster self-sufficiency for all Ward 3 residents receiving public assistance c) POLICIES IN SUPPORT OF HUMAN SERVICES DELIVERY ’(1) Provide additional services for the elderly, including multi-purpose senior centers in areas with high elderly populations. 177 ENROLLED ORIGINAL 2) Improve transit service for the elderly and disabled populations to better enable their travel to and from senior centers and local retail stores 3) Expand and provide interactive, non-passive programs (such as hot lines) to deal with the problem of suicides off the high bridges located in or adjacent to the ward 4) Provide food and shelter to needy populations, but of a size or in settings that avoid adverse effects on surrounding property use. The ward can host numerous facilities without impact if those facilities are consistent with the area’s low density character d) PUBLIC ACTION OBJECTIVE AND POLICIES 1) Ensure that the facility or facilities providing employment services, food stamps, income maintenance, and other human services are located so as to be easily accessible to Ward 3 residents by public transit 2) Facilitate the acquisition of adequate space for possibly one multi-purpose senior center (in addition to the center being located at the former precinct station at Albemarle and 42nd streets Give priority for this with public facilities that are or become vacant. The site selected should be easily accessible by public and private transit 3) Aggressively assist the ward’s religious institutions to host small shelters to provide for the local homeless population. Assistance should include issues of liability, security, adequacy of facilities, etc SEC. 1200.310 LAND USE a) PREFACE. The overall protection and enhancement of established residential and commercial areas are the primary objectives of the District*s land use policy for Ward 3. The effects of nonresidential development on the ward’s residential neighborhoods, and of non-neighborhood-serving redevelopment on the ward’s commercial areas, must be carefully controlled and limited. The predominant land use in Ward 3 is residential, ranging from low-density large estates to moderate density row houses and garden apartments, to high-density multi-storied apartment buildings on several of the major avenues. The Generalized Land Use Map of the Land Use Element designates most of the ward in the low-density residential land use category. Ward 3 has the lowest population density in the city: 16 persons per acre for the ward as a whole and 28 persons per acre in residential areas. Parks, recreation, and open space comprise the second largest land use in Ward 3. About half of the ward’s 5,986 acres (excluding public rights-of-way) is park land (including Rock Creek Park (and tributary valleys Zoological Park, Glover Parkway and Children*s Playground (commonly known as Glover Archbold Park Whitehaven Parkway, Battery Kemble Park, and the C &amp;amp; O Canal This mostly wilderness, natural resource has a significant influence on quality of life in Ward 3. A distinctive feature of Ward 3 is the clustering of retail nodes at regular intervals along major arteries. Commercial land uses cover only some 183 acres, about 3 percent of the ward’s total land area (excluding public rights-of-way They are located mostly on the major arterials. Except for portions of Wisconsin Avenue, the commercial nodes are generally separated by long segments of residential development, primarily apartment buildings. All of the commercial areas (except 178 ENROLLED ORIGINAL perhaps, Friendship Heights) are neighborhood-serving, and the uses tend to be small businesses. The generalized commercial land use map of the Land Use Element designates 1 regional center (Friendship Heights at Wisconsin and Western Avenues 2 multi -neighborhood centers (Tenleytown at Wisconsin Avenue and Albemarle Street, and Forest Hills at Connecticut Avenue and Van Ness Street and 14 local neighborhood centers: 5 on Connecticut Avenue (Chevy Chase in the vicinity of Morrison Street, Forest Hills south of Nebraska Avenue, Cleveland Park in the vicinity of Ordway Street, Woodley Park opposite the Zoo, and Woodley Park north of Calvert Street 4 on Wisconsin Avenue (Friendship Heights south of Fessenden Street, North Cleveland Park in the vicinity of Van Ness Street, Cleveland Park/Cathedral Heights in the vicinity of Newark Street, and Glover Park south of Calvert Street 3 on MacArthur Boulevard (in the vicinities of Cathedral Avenue, Dana Place, and 49th Place 1 on New Mexico Avenue (in the vicinity of Lowell Street and 1 on Massachusetts Avenue (southeast of 49th Street Much of the land use activity over the last several decades has focused on attempts to redevelop these commercial nodes and intensify the nonresidential uses, usually with office space. Because of the ward’s attractiveness and stability such redevelopment pressures are likely to continue especially in the areas around the five Metrorail stations. The Comprehensive Plan and this ward plan recognize that Ward 3~s commercial areas are established, and that redevelopment pressures must be strictly limited and redirected to other areas of the city specified in the Comprehensive Plan for new economic development. There are a large number of institutional uses in Ward 3. These include religious, medical, educational, recreational, or public service uses as well as embassies and chanceries, museums, libraries, and galleries. Examples are the Washington National Cathedral, the National Presbyterian Center, Sibley Memorial Hospital, the Army Distaff Foundations (Knollwood The American University, the University of the District of Columbia, the Howard University Law School, Mount Vernon College, Wesley Theological Seminary, the Washington School of Ballet, Sidwell Friends School, St. Albans, and the National Cathedral School of the Cathedral close, St. John’s College High School, the International Center, INTELSAT, the chancery complex for ttussia, the National Zoo, and the Hillwood and Kreeger museums. Many of these facilities have structures that are an exception to the neighborhood~s land use or that do not conform to the underlying zoning. The comparability of these uses must be maintained, expansion carefully controlled, changes to neighborhood-related uses encouraged, and conversion to other nonconforming uses prevented. There is no industrial land (zoned or in use) in Ward 3. The former CSX rail right-of-way in the palisades has been discontinued and will be a hiker/biker trail under the jurisdiction of the National Park Service. The current land use character of the ward which is reflected in the Comprehensive Plan without change has created a value in the land and attracted an affluence in population that contributes substantially to the DistricCs tax base. This, in turn, enables the District to provide programs necessary for its entire population, and maintains the District as a preferred location for many tupes of organizations and business activities. 179 ENROLLED ORIGINAL b) RELATION OF WARD 3 TO THE DECLARATION OF MAJOR POLICIES IN THE LAND USE ELEMENT OF THE COMPREHENSIVE PLAN The objectives and policies for land use/zoning in Ward 3 are A) maintain the existing land use character of the ward B) protect existing residential n~ighborhoods and enhance their qualities C) maintain and improve the physical condition of the community through the provision of functional, efficient, and attractive residential, commercial, and open space environments D) eliminate existing and potential conflicts between land uses and transportation facilities and functions E) protect existing low-scale neighborhood commercial centers from office and non-neighborhood-serving redevelopment, and retain existing retail services F) encourage redevelopment only in accordance with the relevant sections (e.g economic development and housing) of this ward plan (which reflect and interpret the first eleven elements of the Comprehensive Plan G) correct or prevent inconsistencies between zoning and land uses designated in the Comprehensive Plan, and between building permit issuances and the Comprehensive Plan H) ensure that if development of institutional holdings and large estates or other parcels occurs it is compatible with the physical character of the ward, has no adverse effects on surrounding areas, and is consistent with the Comprehensive Plan I) maintain and improve viable residential areas and eliminate incompatible and nonconforming land uses in or proximate to residential areas J) maintain and enhance viable commercial areas at a scale appropriate to the surrounding areas K) maintain and expand the existing housing stock, where feasible and consistent with the Comprehensive Plan to ensure a greater variety of housing types, opportunities, and choices L) Ensure that land use does not exceed the capacity of the ward’s infrastructure (i.e public facilities and M) Increase the supply of child care facilities in commercial areas within the ward c) l~eserved d) RESIDENTIAL NEIGHBORHOOD OBJECTIVES, POLICIES, AND ACTIONS 1 The Land Use Element designates four housing opportunity areas in Ward 3 (Miller Tract in Spring Valley, Tenleytown Metro Station Area, Whitehaven Woods along Foxhall l~oad, and Friendship Heights at Wisconsin and Western avenues Infill development and future breakup of the few remaining large estates present the only other important potentials for residential development in the ward. Much of this is likely to be controversial a reason to i) encourage interest in and direct development to the housing opportunity areas ii) carefully control development elsewhere; and (iii) ensure stringent protection against infill at inappropriate locations A) Careful controls include ensuring consistency with policies in the Comprehensive Plan including the environment, 180 ENROLLED ORIGINAL transportation, urban design, and preservation and historic features sections of this ward plan avoiding adverse effects and promoting desirable amenities B) Examples of inappropriate infill locations include: the swaths of green space fronting many apartment buildings, particularly along Connecticut Avenue such as Cathedral Mansions, the Kennedy-Warren, and the Broadmoor the few large interior spaces of certain blocks, such as those behind some apartment buildings on Connecticut Avenue and on very large lots in single-family neighborhoods 2) Several areas in the ward, because of their existing low density and "park-like" setting, require land use controls in addition to the requirements of R-1 zoning (the most restrictive zone district ’W(A) The Woodland-Normanstone area has been mapped with the Tree &amp;amp; Slope 1)rotection overlay (11 DCMR 1511 this action should be monitored to ensure that the overlay, as drafted, accomplishes its stated purposes B) This Tree &amp;amp; Slope Protection overlay should be considered and adapted for other park-like, hilly areas such as the Potomac palisades and the portions of the Forest Hills and Barnaby Woods neighborhoods adjacent to Rock Creek Park C) An overlay or other land use controls should be considered and adopted for the Wesley Heights neighborhood to limit infill that is out of keeping with existing house sizes, traditional setbacks, and extensive mature greenery 3) Where the production of new housing is desirable per this plan, zoning flexibility should be considered, especially for the elderly and for low- and moderate-income populations A) Consider increased residential densities (consistent with design scale and infrastructure capacity) in exchange for incorporating low- and moderate-income or elderly housing in development projects. ’~(B) Consider the provision of elderly and low/moderate income housing, when it is a substantial portion of a project, as an important amenity in Planned Unit Developments, provided that such housing shall be on site (given the need for affordable housing in Ward 3, off-site housing shall be disfavored C) Restrict major commercial development in the Friendship Heights and Tenleytown housing opportunity areas D) Tie the provision of housing into commercial developments where rezoning or other zoning benefits are sought. Mixed use developments should be encouraged in commercial zone districts E) Give zoning preference to projects which include housing near each of the ward’s Metrorail stations 4) The conversion of existing housing stock (such as in moderate-rent multi-family buildings near or in commercial areas) should be aggressively discouraged. Transient uses do not meet the housing objectives of this plan e) COMMERCIAL AREAS OBJECTIVES, POLICIES, AND ACTIOblS 1) The ward’s commercial zoning is a legacy of 1950s population projections and the extensive freeway system then planned for the District, even though several map cases imposed overlays or downzoned portions along Wisconsin and Connecticut avenues between 181 ENROLLED ORIGINAL 1986 and 1992. There are still about 50 acres of C-3-A and C-3-B zoning, which allows medium density business and employment buildings from 65 to 90 feet high with a maximum FAR of 4.0 to 6.5, in Friendship Heights, at the Tenleytown Metrorail station, and on Connecticut Avenue in the vicinity of Van Ness Street. Given the policies and land use designations of the Comprehensive Plan, including this ward plan, much of this medium density zoning must be downzoned. T’(A) Tenleytown is designated as a housing opportunity area with mixed use medium density residential and moderate density commercial uses. Without rezoning, this area is likely to see redevelopment with primarily medium density office space threatening its multi-neighborhood retail services and the opportunity for significant new housing B) The Connecticut and Van Ness area is designated in the Land Use Element as moderate density commercial; C-3 zoning is inconsistent. This area also has overloaded, and therefore poorly functioning, intersections. Zoning review for plan consistency is essential 2) The remaining commercial areas of the ward are designated in the Land Use Element for low density. C-1 is a corresponding low density zone category. However, many of these areas remain zoned C-2-A or C-2-B. C-2-A may be appropriate in some places except where parcels could be large or deep and therefore capable of being developed with large buildings that will contain office space and little if any neighborhood-serving retail. Some of these areas have been rezoned to C-I, have a neighborhood commercial overlay (e.g 11 DCMI~ 1300 or have been designated historic landmarks (which somewhat inhibits redevelopment potential Given the policies and land use designations of the Comprehensive Plan, including this ward plan, much of the ward’s e×isting commercial zoning must be further refined A) In October 1986 the Mayor recommended that the Spring Valley Shopping Center (Massachusetts Avenue by 49th Street) be downzoned to C-1. The existing C-2-A zoning for this area would allow changes in height, density, and use that are inconsistent with the Comprehensive Plan and the area’s historic character, and that may be incompatible with the adjacent residential communities. This commercial district must be rezoned (C-1 and/or overlay) to ensure continued consistency between land use and the Comprehensive Plan B) Many of the other commercial nodes or strips remain zoned C-2-A (e.g Wisconsin Avenue in Glover Park and Wisconsin Avenue in the vicinity of Ellicott and Fessenden streets Because C-2-A allows greater commercial FAR than the 1.0 generally provided in local neighborhood serving retail areas, all of the ward’s C-2-A areas must be evaluated in terms of i) the heights, densities, and commercial uses that could occur ii) the likelihood of such redevelopment occurring in a healthy economy; and (iii) the resulting impacts from such redevelopment. Where warranted on the basis of these evaluations, further rezoning (C-1 and/or overlay) must be implemented 3) The Office of Planning should consider zoning techniques that might break up the generally continuous commercial appearance of Wisconsin Avenue and create a greater sense of the commercial areas being distinct nodes, as is the case on the other major avenues in Ward 3. 182 ENROLLED ORIGINAL 4) Zoning amendments adopted around 1979 strictly limit hotel expansion in residential districts. The two large hotel/convention facilities in Ward 3 the Sheraton-Washington and Omni-Shoreham hotels in Woodley Park must be carefully controlled to prevent adverse effects on the adjacent residential community 5) Where applicable, buffers must be provided with new construction to mitigate the sharp transition between some residential and commercial districts. Buffers may be landscaping, fences, or other barriers, or architectural techniques that attempt to eliminate conflicts and adverse impacts (including aesthetics, vistas, shadows, privacy, noise, odors, traffic, parking, and litter 6) Commercial uses should not be introduced to areas where none is now present, and commercial zone districts should not be enlarged in the ward 7) District government agencies and officials must develop better working relationships with Montgomery County and State of Maryland officials to coordinate commercial land use policies for both jurisdictions and to be sensitive to the residential neighborhoods of Ward 3 adjacent to the District’s border f) }reserved g) PUBLIC AND INSTITUTIONAL LAND USE OBJECTIVES, POLICIES, AND ACTIONS ]) Land use in Ward 3 must be sensitive to the retention of green space, compatible in use and scale, and respect the environmental qualities of public lands. In the decision-making to approve development proposals, there shall be a presumption that open space land should be provided. Existing park and recreational open space must be protected, and increased if possible. Park land that is unimproved should not be built upon, even for "public benefit" such as new roads, parking lots, or recreational buildings 2 A) The Office of Planning should prepare a comprehensive analysis of land use and development activities by educational institutions in Ward 3 to evaluate the adverse effects these institutions may have on surrounding neighborhoods. Such effects include excessive noise, light, traffic, parking, off- campus student housing, and so forth. The analysis should include recommendations for eliminating the adverse effects B) Because larger institutions in the ward have sought to remove uses that are substantial components of their approved campus plans, and because this then leaves a void in the campus plan, the Zoning Commission shall amend its regulations to the effect that: any substantial change to an approved campus plan, including but not limited to the relocation of a college, building, or major activity from on campus to off campus, shall be submitted to the Board of Zoning Adjustment together with revisions to the campus plan. Such change, including relocation, shall not be permitted until the Board has approved a revised campus plan (that may not include the relocation if off campus but shall provide for what use or structure is to take its place on campus even though the relocation may be to a district other than a residence district 3) The Zoning Commission must establish an open space zone district to include cemeteries, gardens, and parks. Although the ward is not characterized by the presence of cemeteries, there are at least two: Holy Rood Cemetery at Wisconsin Avenue and 35th Street, and Eldbrooke 183 ENROLLED ORIGINAL United Methodist Church on River l~oad near Wisconsin Avenue. In addition, the ward currently hosts a number of community gardens in areas including Glover Park (near 42nd Street and Tunlaw l~oad}, McLean Gardens (at 39th and Newark streets Tilden Gardens (on Sedgwick Street near Connecticut Avenue and 45th and Warren streets. Most of the ward’s open space gardens are on park land. The ward’s large parks, because they are federally owned, are not currently zoned. All of these uses cemeteries, community gardens, and parks are open spaces that should be zoned as such; for the cemeteries in particular this would discourage redevelopment interest h) ADDITIONAL LAND USE OBJECTIVES, POLICIES, AND ACTIONS 1) Actions by the Zoning Commission and Board of Zoning Adjustment must include consideration of the effects of light, heat, and security on one of Ward 3’s important occupants the U.S. Naval Observatory and Admiral’s House and must limit these effects where adverse. The establishment of the Naval Observatory Precinct District (11 DCMI~ 1531) should be monitored to ensure that the overlay, as drafted, accomplishes its stated purposes 2) The density of new development shall be consistent with the Comprehensive Plan, which for commercial and residential use are outlined in the l~eport of the Committee of the Whole of the Council of the District of Columbia accompanying Bill 8-2, the District of Columbia Comprehensive Plan Amendments Act of 1989 3) Discretionary zoning approvals, such as Planned Unit Developments, affecting Ward 3 shall A) Require traffic mitigation studies, and make recommendations for traffic management (consistent with the Comprehensive Plan including the transportation section of this ward plan) a condition of approval B) Require that an adequate municipal infrastructure (such as road, and public facilities) be in place; if the infrastructure is inadequate, the approval shall include a determination whether the improvements shall be publicly financed or be required of the development applicant as a condition for project approval C) Treat "amenities" such as tax revenue and first-source employment as requirements; and D) Conform to the goals, objectives, and policies of the Comprehensive Plan, including this ward plan. 184 ENROLLED ORIGINAL "SUBTITLE 4 "SEC. 1200.400 "SEC. 1200.400.1 "SEC, 1200.400.2 "SEC. 1200.400.3 "SEC. 1200.400.4 "SEC, 1200.400.5 "SEC. 1200.401 "SEC. 1200.402 "SEC. 1200.403 "SEC. 1200.404 "SEC, 1200.405 "SEC, 1200.406 "SEC. 1200.407 "SEC. 1200.408 "SEC. 1200.409 "SEC. 1200.410 "SEC. 1200.411 "SEC. 1200.412 "SEC. 1200.413 "SEC. 1200.414 "SEC. 1200.415 "SEC. 1200.416 "SEC. 1200.417 "SEC. 1200.418 "SEC. 1200.419 "SEC. 1200.420 "SEC. 1200.421 "SEC. 1200.422 "SEC. 1200.423 "SEC. 1200.424 "SEC. 1200.425 "SEC, 1200.426 "SEC. 1200.427 "WARD 4 PLAN "TABLE OF CONTENTS WARD 4 PLAN INTRODUCTION VISION FOR WARD 4 WARD 4 PLANNING FOCUS WARD 4 HISTORY WARD 4 TODAY WARD 4 ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT WARD 4 OBJECTIVES FOR ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT WARD 4 ACTIONS IN SUPPORT OF ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT WARD 4 HOUSING WARD 4 OBJECTIVES FOR HOUSING WARD 4 ACTIONS IN SUPPORT OF HOUSING WARD 4 ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION WARD 4 OBJECTIVES FOR ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION WARD 4 ACTIONS IN SUPPORT OF ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION WARD 4 TRANSPORTATION WARD 4 OBJECTIVES FOR TRANSPORTATION WARD 4 ACTIONS IN SUPPORT OF TRANSPORTATION WARD 4 PUBLIC FACILITIES WARD 4 OBJECTIVES FOR PUBLIC FACILITIES WARD 4 ACTIONS IN SUPPORT OF PUBLIC FACILITIES WARD 4 URBAN DESIGN WARD 4 OBJECTIVES FOR URBAN DESIGN WARD 4 ACTIONS IN SUPPORT OF URBAN DESIGN WARD 4 PRESERVATION AND HISTORIC FEATURES WARD 4 OBJECTIVES FOR PRESERVATION AND HISTORIC FEATURES WARD 4 ACTIONS IN SUPPORT OF PRESERVATION AND HISTORIC FEATURES WARD 4 HUMAN SERVICES WARD 4 OBJECTIVES FOR HUMAN SERVICES WARD 4 ACTIONS IN SUPPORT OF HUMAN SERVICES WARD 4 LAND USE/ZONING WARD 4 OBJECTIVES FOR LAND USE/ZONING WARD 4 ACTIONS IN SUPPORT OF LAND USE/ZONING "SEC. 1200.400.1 "SEC. 1200.400.2 WARD 4 PLAN INTRODUCTION VISION FOR WARD 4 185 ENROLLED ORIGINAL VV(a) This plan is based on a vision of the future of Ward 4 over the next five years. Because Ward 4 is primarily a stable, residential neighborhood, city officials and ward residents envision few major changes in the overall character of the ward. The vision underscores ensuring that the wardVs many existing qualities are protected and enhanced and that Ward 4 continues to be an attractive and secure place to work and raise a family b) People who live in the ward will want to stay because of its solid neighborhoods and park-like quality. Neighborhoods like Crestwood, Brightwood, Colonial Estates and Petworth have a strong since of community and visual identity. Overall, residential communities will be protected from noise, litter and congestion caused by nonresidential uses. Places of historical significance, gateways and parks and open spaces will continue to provide an attractive setting and quiet refuge for daily living c) The ward will have additional cultural, recreational and community outreach opportunities. Activities like the "Georgia Avenue Day" celebration and special programs for the youth and elderly residents will reinforce the Ward 4 community spirit d) The ward’s neighborhoods will be well-served by improved commercial and industrial centers, employment centers and a transportation network to meet the needs of its residents, businesses and property owners. Neighborhood-serving commercial areas already have a strong presence in the ward. Georgia Avenue and Kennedy Street, the primary commercial areas, contain a mix of retail, office and residential uses. These areas should be developed with strengthened nodes of commercial/retail services; sufficient parking to meet employment and customers~ needs; adequate lighting, facade and street improvements; and mini-parks and trees e) The transportation system should be designed to enable residents to travel to employment centers in the ward, the rest of the city and surrounding suburbs. Metrorail Green Line stations at Fort Torten and Georgia Avenue/Petworth will provide convenient transit services and improved bicycle routes will offer safe and convenient travel alternatives f) The vision also includes improving housing choices and making more efficient use of the existing housing. The increasing elderly population in Ward 4 will require housing options such as condominiums or senior citizens group housing. New and rehabilitated housing for low- and moderate-income persons should be developed. These housing options, along with the other features of the ward, will attract a diverse, productive population to Ward 4, ensuring that it remains a vital community SEC. 1200.400.3 WARD 4 PLANNING FOCUS ~The focus of the Ward 4 Plan is to 1) Give priority to the protection, rehabilitation and improvement of neighborhoods through code enforcement and neighborhood conservation programs 2) Emphasize those measures that contribute to an orderly process of neighborhood stabilization 3) Encourage the provision of new job opportunities and the effective use of the inventory of commercial land; 186 ENRf)LLEO ORIGtNAL 4) Capitalize on Metrorail station areas as focal points for retail services, office and community activities 5) Give priority to upgrading existing public services and facilities 6) Suggest ways of using public investments in the maintenance and location of capital improvement projects to stimulate privately funded renovation of existing residential, commercial and industrial properties 7) Discourage the extension of strip commercial areas through the designation of appropriate development sites and the location and design of commercial clusters; and 8) Encourage the development of new employment areas that are located and designed to avoid and minimize adverse impacts on adjoining land uses, particularly nearby residential areas SEC. 1200.400.4 WARD 4 HISTORY a) Early development of Ward 4 was influenced by two factors a water source called Crystal Springs and horse racing. Historians indicate that a tavern, farm or estate probably developed near Crystal Springs which was later called Brightwood. This area grew slowly until horse racing emerged as a major recreational activity in the mid-1800s. Patrons of the races traveled to the area along Brightwood Turnpike built in 1819. The turnpike, which today is Georgia Avenue, ran between the old city boundary (now Florida Avenue) and Eastern Avenue. It led to the development of permanent residences in the area b) Because of the topography, during the Civil War three military forts were established in the Crystal Springs area: Fort Torten, Fort Slocum and Fort Stevens. President Lincoln observed a skirmish between Union and Confederate forces at Fort Stevens. These sites are now part of the historic Fort Circle Park System. Development in the area increased after the Civil War, with new growth occurring along the Brightwood Turnpike (Georgia Avenue) to Maryland, and along Military Road which connected with streets leading to the docks in Georgetown c) Principally farms, estates and summer homes were developed in the territory from Silver Spring in Maryland, south to Rock Creek Church Road and west from Chillum to Rock Creek Park. Toward the end of the 19th century, Brightwood became a suburban village where affluent families lived on large estates. As further development occurred, Brightwood was subdivided into the neighborhoods that we know today as Petworth, Brightwood Park, Brightwood and Lamond d) Takoma Park, another historic neighborhood in Ward 4, was founded by Benjamin Gilbert in the early 1880s. It developed along the Brightwood Railroad Station, near Fourth Street and Blair Road. The Brightwood Railroad Station, renamed Takoma Park in the mid-1880s, is now the location of the Takoma Park Metro Station. The U.S. Soldier’s Home, built in 1851 near Rock Creek Church Road, and the Walter Reed Army Hospital, built in 1909 on Georgia Avenue, sparked residential and commercial development in surrounding areas. These early subdivisions and transportation routes shaped Ward 4’s land use patterns e) Sixteenth Street, Georgia Avenue and Military Road stimulated residential and related commercial development in the late 1800s and early 20th century. These streets remain significant today as major transportation routes, providing primary access to the neighborhoods in ENROLLED ORIGINAL Ward 4, between the ward and the rest of the city, and to the Maryland suburbs f) Until the 1950s, the area had a predominantly middle- to upper-income white population. Most of the white population moved to areas west of Rock Creek Park and to Maryland suburban communities in the 1950s and 1960s. They were replaced largely by middle-income professional black families and individuals. Between 1964 and 1980, the racial composition, remained fairly constant, with the ward maintaining a predominantly black population SEC. 1200.400.5 WARD 4 TODAY a) Ward 4 is in the northwest quadrant of the District of Columbia. The ward’s boundaries are Eastern Avenue to the north, extending to the northeast; Baltimore and Ohio Railroad (B&amp;amp;O) tracks and Harewood Road to the east; Michigan Avenue, Park Road, Spring Road and Piney Branch Parkway to the south; and Rock Creek Park to the west b) Existing Land Use Patterns 1) Ward 4 is largely residential, supported by shopping areas, churches, schools, recreational facilities, and a number of major institutions that serve the city, the region and, in some cases, the entire nation. The major institutions include the Walter Reed Army Medical Center, the U.S. Soldiers and Airmen’s Home, the Washington Hospital Center, Children’s Hospital, and Veterans Administration Hospital. These facilities, in addition to offering needed medical and educational services, also provide the bulk of the approximately 29,000 jobs located in the ward 2) Houses are mainly single-family detached and row units, with some apartments concentrated near the major streets. In most neighborhoods, the environment is good and houses are structurally sound. In addition, community spirit and cooperation are strong 3) Rock Creek Park is the ward’s western border and, to an extent, acts as a barrier between Ward 4 and Ward 3 further to the west. The park provides a massive buffer of green space as well as opportunities for both passive and active recreation. Outdoor concerts are held at the park’s Carter Barren Amphitheater 4) The Baltimore and Ohio Railroad right-of-way, which also serves as the alignment for the Metrorail Red Line, forms a portion of the ward’s eastern boundary. The railroad area is appropriate for some light industry, but is also a barrier between neighborhoods and poses environmental problems for nearby residential areas c) Neighborhoods 1) Ward 4 has many well-known, stable neighborhoods, such as Crestwood, Shepherd Park, Takoma, Lamond-Riggs, Manor Park, Brightwood, Colonial Village, Petworth, North Portal Estates and Brightwood Park. Each neighborhood is unique in demographic, social, economic and housing characteristics. They contain a diverse mix of housing types that will accommodate a variety of income ranges 2) Crestwood, Colonial Village and North Portal Estates are affluent neighborhoods bordering Rock Creek Park. They are developed with single-family detached homes on relatively large lots. These quiet neighborhoods are characterized by curving non-thru streets and cul-de-sacs. Because the park is a natural barrier, access to these 188 ENROLLED ORIGINAL neighborhoods is limited, traffic is restricted, and open space is abundant 3) Shepherd Park, Takoma Park, Brightwood, Manor Park and Lamond/P~iggs are dominated by middle income, single-family detached and semi-detached houses, l~ortions of Brightwood and Brightwood 1Park, primarily near Missouri Avenue and 14th Street, contain row houses and a concentration of apartments, which provide a greater range of housing choices 4) Takoma Park is one of the oldest neighborhoods in the ward, and some of its original wood-frame houses still exist. The Takoma Park Metrorail Station, one of two Metro stations in Ward 4, is also located in this neighborhood 5) The Brightwood Park and Petworth neighborhoods are developed primarily with row houses. Most of the homes are brick or stone, two-story structures with front porches and repetitious window patterns, and are set back the same distance from the street. These row houses generally extend from the U.S. Soldiers and Airmen~s Home to 15th Street d) Commercial Areas/Nodal Development f’(1) The Georgia Avenue commercial strip bisects the Brightwood, Brightwood Park and Petworth neighborhoods. This commercial district is the longest retail strip in the city, extending about 40 blocks for the full length of Ward 4 into the Shaw area in Ward 2. It is broken in only two areas--near the southern end of the ward between Allison and Decatur streets and near Walter Keed Army Hospital, which is primarily residential ’(2) The strip contains a variety of retail outlets, mostly convenience stores, with few comparison goods. Fast food shops, beauty/barber shops, grocery/delicatessen stores, gasoline stations and new and used car dealerships are typical. In addition, there are small, service-oriented offices within the area. It is estimated that about 85 percent of the commercial land is used for retail and the remaining 15 percent for offices 3) Major businesses that attract people to the area are interspersed along Georgia Avenue. These include the C&amp;amp;P Telephone Company at Hamilton Street and Georgia Avenue; three Safeway grocery stores; Morton’s department store at Longfellow Street; and the Posin’s Bakery and Delicatessen. The physical condition of businesses along the strip vary, but overall the structures need to be improved 4) The Kennedy Street commercial area extends from Georgia Avenue east to New Hampshire Avenue. Commercial activities along Kennedy Street are similar to those along Georgia Avenue. However, there are more homes and fewer stores. Many stores are in the first level of row houses with residential uses above. Other significant commercial activity in the ward is at the Riggs l~oad Shopping Center at Riggs l~oad and Third Street, N.W along 14th Street N.W. between Allison and Decatur streets; and adjacent to the Takoma Park Metro Station e) Current Development Activity 1) The National Council of Senior Citizens’ Johnson Towers Senior Citizens Apartment complex was completed in the Fall of 1991. The structure consist of five stories in height and will have 55 apartment units. It is located at 13th and Upshur Streets, N.W. 189 ENROLLED ORIGINAL 2) Park Place Townhouse has been expanded at Trinity Walk North Capitol Street and Michigan Avenue, N.E with 97 additional units. Approximately 20 units have been reserved for moderate-income families 3) The National Baptist Convention Board is constructing a three story housing unit under Section 202 for the handicapped at 13th and Upshur streets N.W near ]~oosevelt High School. ttenters are expected to pay only 28 percent of their income for the units 4) The Colony Theatre an old neighborhood movie theater at Georgia Avenue and Farragut Street has been acquired by the People’s Involvement Corporation for redevelopment as an apartment building. The project will provide 50 units for the elderly and handicapped and a 45,656-square-foot ground floor retail space. Approximately 10,500 square feet of space will be provided for parking on a vacant lot in the interior of the square 5) The Washington Metropolitan Area Transit Authority (WMATA) has received full funding to construct the Green Line Metro route from the U Street/Cardozo Metro Station to the Fort Torten Station. It will include two new stations in the District: the Columbia Heights Station (in Ward 1) and the Georgia Avenue/Petworth Station in Ward 4. The Green Line will extend from Fort Torten to Maryland and will include four new Metrorail stations: West ttyattsville, Prince Georges Plaza, College Park and Greenbelt. A new lower-level will be built at Fort Torten, the only station on this segment within the District. Service is scheduled to begin in 1993 6) The Washington Metropolitan Area Transit Authority (WMATA) has remodeled the Northern Bus Garage to improve administration, bus service and maintenance. The modification will include a 288-space parking deck and space for community use. This facility is at 14th and Decatur streets, N.W 7) The District has recently installed a Computerized Traffic Control System throughout the city. Among the traffic signalization efforts undertaken in Ward 4 is an electronic left turn signal at the intersection of Georgia and Missouri avenues, N.W 8) The Shepherd Park Public Library, at Georgia Avenue and Geranium Street, N.W was completed in March 1990. It is a brick, two-story, 20,419-square-foot facility, with rear parking 9) The Department of ttecreation and Parks has improved the Keene Playground at the intersection of Fort Torten Drive and Riggs Koad, N.E. Improvements included a safety turf, a color-coded play area, tennis and basketball courts, a picnic area, lights, and a separate preschool play area 10) The Petworth l~ecreation Center at Taylor and Eighth streets, N.W has been rehabilitated. A 500-square-foot addition has been added to the 922-square-foot fieldhouse, and the grounds are being rehabilitated 11) Kehabilitation of the Fort Stevens Fieldhouse (recreation center) was completed in 1989. It now has additional multi-purpose rooms, restrooms with showers, office space and handicap access 12) The Office on Aging, in a joint effort with the Department of Kecreation and Parks, has constructed a Senior Citizens Wellness Center at Fort Stevens. The center provides a variety of services for the elderly. 190 ENROLLED ORIGINAL 13) The District of Columbia Public Schools is in the process of renovating Coolidge High School located at Fifth and Tuckerman streets 14) The Sharpe Health School at 13th and Allison streets, N.W. is being renovated to accommodate handicapped students 15) The Department of Human Services is improving the 83,900-square-foot North Mental Health Facility at 1125 Spring Road 16) The Department of Public Works, Office of Bicycle Transportation, with the assistance of the Bicycle Advisory Council (BAC has produced a bicycle transportation plan which includes a number of new routes in Ward 4. The proposed routes include: Park Road, Gallatin Street, Irving Street, Michigan Avenue, Aspen Street, 14th Street, Harewood Road, Kansas Avenue, Taylor Street, Eighth Street and 16th Street 17) Other planned bicycle routes include the Fort Circle Trail (from Fort Torten north to Sligo Mill Road, then west along the Missouri Avenue corridor to Rock Creek and the Metropolitan Branch Trail (from Fort Torten along the Fort Circle Trail to Sligo Mill Road, then north along the B&amp;amp;O railroad corridor into Maryland 18) The new developer for the Gateway Project at Georgia and Eastern Avenues, N.W. proposes to renovate the existing structure through facade treatment and remodeling of the interior. The developer plans to attract eight (8) businesses to the site and increase employment opportunities within the community 19) The Department of Human Services is requesting over $1.4 million in new capital authority for the acquisition of the property at 6045 16th Street, N.W. to be used as an adult day program facility. The property is presently owned by the Hebrew Academy of Greater Washington 20) The Department of Public Works is in the process of improving the Fort Torten transfer station on Brookland Avenue and Bates Street, N.E. Renovations include installing a dust control system and renovating the trash compactor operating booths 21) The Water and Sewer Enterprise Fund is constructing a 20 million gallon water storage reservoir and a booster pumping station at Georgia and Missouri avenues, N.W. This project is expected to be completed in 1996 22) The Office of Business and Economic Development, in cooperation with the Department of Recreation and Parks, has begun landscape improvements at the corner of Second and Kennedy streets, N.W. and Missouri Avenue. Improvements include 24 raised planter boxes and matching trash receptacles 23) Exxon Gas Company is rebuilding a gasoline station at 5215 North Capitol Street, N.E. The service station will include a car wash, gasoline pumps and a convenience grocery store 24) Trinity Housing has renovated a three story building at the corner of Georgia and Illinois Avenues, N.W. This housing unit will be used for transitional housing for homeless families. It consist of 14 units and families are expected to pay 1/3 (one-third) of their monthly income. The project is funded through Manna, Inc f) Demographic Characteristics 1) Population 191 &amp;amp; ROLLED OR;’ iiiAL A) Ward 4 had an estimated population of 78,400 in 1990, a decrease of 3,600 (or three percent) from the 1980 figure of 82,000. The ward’s population is predominantly black, with black and other races making up 85 percent of the population in 1988. Citywide, the figure was 66 percent. In the 1980 census Others" comprised 2 percent of the Ward 4 population and 3 percent of the District’s population. A separate estimate for "Others" is available for 1990 B) Looking at the population by age, there is a higher proportion of middle-aged and elderly residents in the ward, compared with the city. In 1988, 28 percent of the ward’s population was 45 years of age or older, and 15 percent was 65 or over. The corresponding citywide figures were 20 percent and 13 percent, respectively. The age distribution for 1980 was relatively unchanged in 1990. For example, there was a four percent decrease from the 1980 figures for the number of persons 45 years of age or older, and a 3 percent increase for those 65 or over 2) Housing A) The number of households in the ward in 1990 was 28,900 A household is equivalent to an occupied housing unit This was a decrease of 300, or 3 percent, from the 1980 figure of 29,200. It equalled the city’s percentage increase in households during the same period. The mean household size in Ward 4 decreased from 2.7 to 2.5 between 1980 and 1990. For the city, it decreased from 2.4 to 2.3 B) Fifty-three percent of the households in the ward in 1990 owned their homes, compared with the citywide figure of 39 percent. This home ownership is the highest for all wards in the city. High home ownership rates typically occur where housing consists of mainly one-unit structures (single-family dwellings Therefore, it is not surprising that 59 percent of the ward’s housing units are in one-unit structures, compared with 38 percent for the city. Only five percent of the housing units were in structures with five or more units, compared with 22 percent for the city C) The median value of owner-occupied housing units, in Ward 4, was $118,600 in 1990 as opposed to $68,500 in 1980. There was an increase of $50,100 or six percent in the median value of owner-occupied housing units 3) Income A) In 1989 the median household income for Ward 4 was $33,100, eight percent higher than the citywide figure of $30,700. According to the 1980 census, the 1979 median household income for Ward 4 was $19,000, or 17 percent higher than the citywide figure of $16,200. This indicates that while the ward’s income continued to exceed the city’s in 1985 the substantial gap that existed in 1979 had narrowed B) An examination of the proportion of households in various income ranges is also useful for comparing Ward 4 to the city. In 1990, ii percent of the ward’s households had incomes under $10,000, compared with 17 percent for the city C) The ward continued to have a lower percentage of households in poverty than the city, although the difference narrowed from 1979 to 1985. The Census Bureau defines poverty as an annual income of $7,200 or less for a family of four. In 1984, approximately 2,700 (or 9 percent) of the households in Ward 4 were below the poverty level. This was three percentage points lower than the citywide rate of 192 15 percent. The 1979 poverty rate for the ward was 11 percent, 6 percentage points lower than the citywide rate of 17 percent D) The ward also had a lower rate of persons receiving food stamps and Aid to Families with Dependent Children than the city. In 1990, 8 percent of the city population received food stamps compared with only 4 percent in Ward 4. Four percent of the persons living in the ward received Aid to Families with Dependent Children compared with 7 percent at the city level 4) Employment A) According to the 1980 census, 42,100 persons in Ward 4 were eligible for the workforce with 39,400 actually employed. The unemployment rate for the ward was 6.3 perco~nt, which was one percent less than the city average of 7.3 percent B) Based on 1988 estimates for the ward, the total number of persons eligible for the work force was 43,000, with 41,400 actually employed. The unemployment rate for the ward was 4.1 percent, and for the city 5.0 percent. A majority of the persons employed within the ward were in professional and managerial occupations 5) Education Status A) Educational attainment is usually an indicator of the general social and economic conditions within a community. A higher level of education is usually associated with a higher level of income B) Nine percent of those in Ward 4 had completed only an eighth grade education. Twenty-five percent completed high school, but did not continue their education further. Twenty-five percent completed four or more years of college. This rate of college completion is below the citywide rate of 33 percent SEC. 1200.401 WARD 4 ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT a) Economic development means lobs, increased revenues to the city, new businesses and additional services to ward and city residents b) l~etail areas in Ward 4 serve basically local neighborhoods. Most of the areas have declined over the past 25 years, resulting in limited neighborhood consumer goods and services. Georgia Avenue, Kennedy Street and the Takoma neighborhood, the major commercial areas in the ward, demonstrate this decline. The Georgia Avenue and Kennedy Street areas are primarily developed with 1- and 2-story retail structures and office buildings that rarely exceed 4 stories. Approximately 500 businesses are located along the Georgia Avenue and Kennedy Street corridors. Georgia Avenue also contains some private homes c) The city has established a number of programs to stimulate economic development and revitalize the ward’s commercial corridor. The Georgia Avenue Neighborhood Commercial Revitalization Program, for example, offers area businesses general business loans and technical assistance through the Business Purchases Assistance Program, the Facade Loan Program and others. It establishes a cooperative spirit between business owners, banking institutions and the city to revitalize this corridor d) New neighborhood-serving retail centers, additional space in existing centers and rehabilitation of existing facilities are underway in the ward. The Heights residential development contains adjunct commercial services at Taylor Street and Hawaii Avenue. A neighborhood commercial area is adjacent to the Cloisters residential project on Michigan 193 ENROLLED ORIGINAL Avenue. The Riggs Road shopping area, a multi-neighborhood center, has added new commercial space and is improving the quality of services, facilities and the physical environment. Improvements to the Northern Metrobus Garage, at 14th and Decatur streets, may encourage nearby merchants to improve their stores. Efforts to improve conditions at other neighborhood commercial areas should stimulate additional economic activity in the ward e) In Takoma, retail services are centered around the Takoma Metro Station and part of the historic district. The area extends approximately seven blocks on Blair Road N.W between Fourth and Chestnut streets, N.W. It is expected to benefit economically from Metro station activity. The Takoma Economic Revitalization Plan, prepared by the Office of Business and Economic Development, identifies projects with development potential S EC. 1200.402 WARD 4 OBJECTIVES FOR ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT "The objectives for economic development are 1) Create and expand retail activity focused primarily on designated nodes and on Georgia Avenue, Kennedy Street and the Georgia Avenue/Petworth and Fort Torten Metro Station areas 2) Increase job opportunities for Ward 4 residents, especially for the unemployed, the underemployed and youth preparing to enter the labor force 3) Establish a joint public and private economic development entity with development expertise and the resources to facilitate the implementation of the ward’s economic development objectives and policies SEC. 1200.403 WARD 4 ACTIONS IN SUPPORT OF ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT "The policies in support of economic development are as follows 1) Develop an action plan for vacant commercial properties at designated commercial nodes along Georgia Avenue and Kennedy Street and at North Capitol Street and Riggs Road A) Commercial properties that are underused do not contribute to the economic activity in the ward or District. They afford an opportunity to upgrade existing neighborhood commercial centers and to eliminate blighted sites from the ward B) Recommended actions i) Provide technical and financial assistance to businesses that have been displaced, are proposed to be displaced or are in danger of closing ii Encourage businesses that provide neighborhood-serving retail support to the surrounding neighborhoods to participate in the OBED commercial revitalization program iii) Identify additional areas with underused properties that have the potential for new and expanded residential and commercial development iv) Develop detailed plans for the above areas. Recommend to the Zoning Commission zoning changes to advance the improvement and stability of the specialized areas. 194 ENROLLED ORIGINAL v) Initiate small area studies for the following areas: Kennedy Street Corridor, 14th Street Corridor, Petworth Neighborhood and the Georgia Avenue Corridor vi) Coordinate efforts of the public and private sectors to accelerate the revitalization of the Georgia Avenue corridor vii) Identify appropriate public programs that can assist in the revitalization of the Georgia Avenue corridor, including industrial revenue bonds, tax increment financing, tax abatement, and any implementing legislation required 2) To assure that new commercial development does not produce negative impacts, such as traffic, parking, litter and noise, on surrounding residential areas A) l~esidential areas adjoining new and existing commercial development should be protected from potential negative physical impacts of development through the use of landscape buffers; restricted use and intensity between residential and nonresidential areas; and improved traffic circulation and parking management. Neighborhoods of particular concern include those areas along Georgia Avenue and Kennedy Street, and adjacent to Metro stations B) l~ecommended actions i) Modify existing land use controls, including traffic and parking regulations it) Design and implement measures to control adverse impacts on adjacent residential areas, including traffic, parking, litter, noise and others iii) Give serious consideration to citizen-generated plans, such as the Shepherd Park Plan, to ensure that development is responsive to community needs and concerns 3) To assist minority and small businesses to be viable and to provide essential retail and other services at the ward level A) It is essential to support minority business development and retention within the ward. This will stimulate economic activity throughout the ward as well as the city, and provide economic opportunities in terms of availability of jobs and private business ownership B) l~ecommended actions i) Assess the minority composition of the ward to determine the mix of minority and other businesses, then establish a mechanism to work toward achieving identified objectives ii) Establish an incentive program to encourage minority entrepreneurs to establish, expand and diversify operations to meet the consumer needs of the ward or market area iii) Establish, as necessary, a new assistance program to address the needs of minority firms iv) Assist minority business enterprises to meet requirements for certification that will enable them to take advantage of contracting opportunities in the sheltered market program, established under D.C. Law 1-95 4) Upgrade local neighborhood centers to better serve and support the community A) Local neighborhood business centers, similar to those at Kennedy Street, 14th Street and Colorado Avenue, show a decline of small business operations. These centers need to be upgraded to provide 195 ENROLLED ORIGINAL a better mix of retail and convenience goods and service to support nearby residential communities B) Recommended actions i) Expand the use of the city’s Neighborhood Commercial Revitalization Program, Finance Assistance Program, Capital Improvement and Economic Development Program and the Commercial Facade Improvement Program (or any combination of them) to assist business operations ii) Improve the de sign of building frontages, related streetscape and other design considerations iii) Provide other business support assistance. ’SEC. 1200.~I04 WARD 4 HOUSING a) Housing is the primary land use in Ward 4. The continued well-being of the ward depends, in part, on maintaining, conserving and expanding the housing stock, particularly affordable housing for low- and moderate-income persons. Meeting this need requires the involvement of the public and private sectors working as partners b) Ward 4 has a variety of housing types that will accommodate a wide range of income groups. The Crestwood neighborhood, for example, contains some of the District’s most prestigious owner-occupied, middle to high income residences. In the Petworth neighborhood, affordable housing for the elderly, blue-collar workers and first time home buyers predominates. In 1986, Ward 4 had a net increase of 600 (or 2 percent) housing units. The majority of new housing constructed within the last 15 years has been multi-family units and town houses. The recent expansion of the Park Place town houses, at Trinity Walk, will increase the ward’s housing supply by 97 units c) Providing affordable housing in the vicinity of Georgia and Eastern avenues; Georgia and Missouri avenues the Georgia Avenue/Petworth Metrorail Stations; and on Kennedy Street is a priority. If proposed mixed-use development projects are realized, the cost of housing in these areas is likely to rise. In addition, many of the ripple effects that often accompany development (increased land value, real estate speculation) must be carefully examined. Specific government programs, financing, tax policies and development controls must be established to provide practical approaches to maintaining housing that is affordably priced d) Housing to accommodate older residents, in particular, requires immediate attention. The former Upshur Street Clinic site, designated in the Comprehensive Plan as a Housing Opportunity Area, is presently being developed with 55 housing units for senior citizens e) Housing Opportunity Areas are sites where the District expects and encourages major new housing developments and rehabilitated housing. Most Metrorail stations outside the Central Employment Area, and some within, will support additional housing units. The conversion of existing nonresidential buildings for housing and the return of vacant units to the housing supply are two additional means of producing more housing units. ’(f) The Department of Housing and Community Development, the Department of Public and Assisted Housing and the D.C. Housing Finance Agency are the District of Columbia agencies primarily responsible for providing assistance for home ownership for District 196 ENROLLED ORIGINAL residents. Affordable housing programs, such as the Home Purchase Assistance Program, provide home ownership opportunities for Ward 4 residents. The private sector will continue to play a pivotal role in providing housing opportunities and choices in the ward SEC. 1200.405 WARD 4 OBJECTIVES FOR HOUSING "The objectives for housing are 1) Provide for the housing needs of low- and moderate-income households, improve the District’s low-rent housing programs, encourage home ownership and reduce the overall cost of housing among low- and moderate-income households in the ward 2) Protect, preserve, maintain and rehabilitate the existing owned and rental housing stock 3) Encourage the private sector to provide new housing to meet the needs of present and future District residents at locations consistent with District land use policies and objectives 4) Develop additional public progra~ns to support the construction, preservation and maintenance of Ward 4’s rental housing stock 5) Stimulate the construction and expansion of housing for elderly households in the Fort Torten Metrorail Station and the Upshur Street Clinic Housing Opportunities Areas and on the proposed Georgia Avenue/Petworth Metro Station development site 6) Control the conversion of residential housing to nonresidential and transient use (boarding and rooming housing SEC. 1200.406 WARD 4 ACTIONS IN SUPPORT OF HOUSING 1) Encourage new and rehabilitated affordable housing for area residents A) Housing opportunities are limited, particularly for low- and moderate-income persons in Ward 4. It is important to stimulate new and rehabilitated housing to meet all levels of need and demand, and to provide incentives to produce the types of housing needed at desired locations. The following areas in Ward 4 have been designated as Housing Opportunity Areas: The Upshur Street Clinic site, bounded b}, Allison Street on the north, 13th Street on the east, Shepherd Street on the south and 14th Street on the west; and the Fort Torten Metrorail Station area, bounded by the B&amp;amp;O Railroad to the west, Gallatin Street to the north, South Dakota Avenue to the east and Buchannan Street to the south B) Recommended actions i) Include within plans for the Fort Torten Metrorail Station area a range of market rate and affordable housing units as major components for this important development area ii) Encourage housing for elderly and handicapped residents through local and federal programs and activities iii) Prepare comprehensive housing development plans for the Housing Opportunity Areas to meet a broad range of housing needs. Develop a capital leverage program to encourage potential home ownership iv) Work with the private sector and non-profit sponsors to develop a comprehensive program to provide housing within the ward, particularly in Housing Opportunity Areas. 197 ENROLLED ORIGINAL v) Coordinate the financing of multi-family/single-family project proposals through the issuance of tax exempt housing securities and solicit the help of private financial institutions to serve as the principle supplier of below market, fixed rate loans to home buyers who receive local government assistance 2) Develop a comprehensive housing development reporting procedure and housing inventory that monitor programs and development projects to provide a broad range of current housing information to development interests, community residents and others who may be interested in housing in the ward A) A comprehensive housing reporting procedure and housing inventory are important to the development of new housing and the rehabilitation of existing housing that will meet the District’s housing needs. This information could be used to track housing development for low- to moderate-income levels as well as market rate housing. ’~(B) Recommended actions i) Maintain and update a perpetual housing inventory ii) Identify sites for housing and mixed-use housing opportunities iii) Develop programs to encourage the construction, preservation and maintenance of rental housing units 3) To provide a wider range of housing opportunities for the elderly A) The production of various types of housing for elderly individuals and households should be a major priority of the District government. Particular emphasis should be given to low cost affordable housing for the elderly B) l~ecommended actions i) Expand housing opportunities for the elderly by using existing and new federal and local programs and activities. Use Community Development Block Grants to expand housing development ii) Expand outreach programs for senior citizens to inform them of vacancies in public housing facilities that have been designed for the elderly SEC. 1200.407 WARD 4 ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION a) The District has made substantial progress in the past decade in improving the city’s environment. Air and water quality have improved, along with sewer maintenance and repairs. Improved water management regulations and guidelines for conservation management by homeowners have been prepared. Programs such as the ~Clean It or Lien It" law are helping to improve the quality of the environment b) Most areas in Ward 4 have a good environmental quality. Environmental hazards caused by litter, trash and weeds are problems in the deteriorating commercial areas and on vacant lots. The Georgia Avenue and Kennedy Street corridors are major sites for litter, while trash accumulation is common at some apartment buildings. Truck traffic-related problems are of major concern in neighborhoods bordering ]Fort Torten and the B&amp;amp;O Railroad corridor. Bus traffic on residential streets is of particular concern in residential areas adjacent to the Northern Metrobus Garage. 198 ENROLLED ORIGINAL c) Environmental priorities that require immediate attention in Ward 4 include: the need for improved management of soil erosion (especially for new development control of litter, street maintenance, maintenance of private vacant properties, maintenance of the ward’s parks and open space, and enforcement of regulations on truck traffic on residential streets d) Improving environmental conditions in the ward’s neighborhoods will depend, in part, upon more active involvement of residents to help keep their communities clean and trash free. Citizens should inform the Department of Public Works, Division of Sanitation Services, of trash problems on public property. They may also call the Department of Consumer and Regulatory Affairs to report uncollected trash from businesses, institutions and apartment buildings. In addition, residents may take bulk trash or other waste that is not regularly picked up directly to the Fort Torten Transfer Station on Fort Torten Drive between the hours of 8:00 a.m. and 4:00 p.m. Advisory Neighborhood Commissions, community organizations and neighborhood newspapers can spread this information to households in the ward SEC. 1200.408 WARD 4 OBJECTIVES FOR ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION "The objectives for environmental protection are 1) Protect and improve the ward’s natural and man-made environment 2) Improve the air quality in the ward to meet public health standards 3) Protect the environment in ways that maintain and elevate the quality of life and the sense of well-being for ward residents, workers and visitors 4) Establish traffic management strategies to separate local traffic from commuter or through traffic that currently moves through residential neighborhoods, by ensuring that commuter, through and truck traffic use arterial streets 5) Promote the use of Metrorail, including completion of the Green Line through the ward, as a means of reducing commuter traffic from neighborhood streets 6) Ensure adequate protection of public health and safety by testing for and removing lead, radon, asbestos and other hazardous substances from the man-made environment 7) Encourage increased environmental planning throughout the ward 8) Encourage greater participation by Ward 4 residents and owners of businesses in maintaining adequate environmental standards by increasing public awareness and continuing and expanding enforcement of programs that protect the environment SEC. 1200. 409 WARD 4 ACTIONS IN SUPPORT O]? ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION "The policies in support of environmental protection are as follows 1) Ensure reliable and adequate refuse collection from residences, business establishments and other activities that generate waste. 199 ’V(A) Trash build-up around apartment buildings and business establishments is a serious public health problem. It contributes to rodent infestation, spread of disease and declining neighborhood quality B) Recommended actions i) Survey areas around apartment buildings on Kennedy Street, Georgia Avenue, Military Road and other areas for chronic trash build-up. Improve and expand code enforcement to ensure that businesses and apartment buildings remove their trash properly and on a timely basis ii) Provide information to the ward’s residents regarding the availability of the Fort Totten Transfer Station so that they can use the facility to dispose of waste materials at no cost iii) Sponsor and publicize neighborhood clean-up campaigns in con]unction with the city’s bulk trash removal schedule 2) Upgrade existing street lighting and install additional lighting where needed A) Poor lighting in some neighborhoods contributes to traffic safety problems, crime and other street hazards B) Recommended actions i) Survey ward neighborhoods to identify streets where inadequate lighting contributes to traffic problems and crime ii) Add new and improve existing lighting, where needed, in commercial areas along Georgia Avenue, the Fort Torten Metro area, and Kennedy Street 3) Regulate land development activities to protect and preserve natural features, where possible, prevent soil erosion, and prohibit construction practices that produce unstable soil and hillslide conditions A) Serious drainage problems exist in the areas between Rock Creek Church Road, North Capitol Street and Fort Torten Drive. It is important to develop land use control measures through coordinated community and government action programs and plans. This should include a systematic monitoring of neighborhood social and physical conditions and a continuing assessment of land use and regulatory actions to correct deficiencies B) Recommended actions i) Conduct a survey to identify existing soil erosion and drainage problems and to encourage property owners to take corrective action ii) Ensure that the District’s permitting and regulatory processes, such as building permit reviews, code enforcement and Large Tract Review (where applicable require that new development take appropriate measures to prevent soil erosion and drainage problems 4) Assure that abandoned automobiles are removed from streets and alleys A) Automobiles are abandoned along many streets in various neighborhoods in the ward. They become havens for rodents, reduce the number of available parking spaces for residents and blight the ward neighborhoods and shopping centers B) Recommended actions i) Investigate and identify abandoned automobiles. 200 ENROLLEO ORIGINAL ii) Expand enforcement of the Parking Enforcement Program The Parking Enforcement Program is designed to provide for pedestrian safety and motorists’ rights and to enhance the visual environment in the Downtown and neighborhood commercial areas 5) Remove lead feeder pipes that provide water for drinking and food preparation in residential units and commercial establishments A) The Department of Public Works has recently engaged a specialized engineering consultant to conduct an extensive Lead In Water Study in the District. The main purpose of the study is to identify the causes of lead in drinking water. The study will include a detailed review of the District’s water distribution network, treatment methods currently adopted by the Corps of Engineers at the city’s two water filtration plants--Dalacarlia and McMillan--and water quality analyses of several water samples from 400 homes located citywide. The study, when completed, will enable the District to assess the extent of the lead hazard in drinking water and develop ways to reduce the hazard. This will also contribute to meeting the lead testing objectives of the 1989 Comprehensive Plan amendments B) Recommended actions i) The District of Columbia should implement the requirement of Section 404, Paragraph 8, in D.C. Law 8-129 which states: Initiate a program of testing for lead in each residential property and in any facility that provides water for drink or food preparation and develop a program for the replacement of lead pipes ii) Continue the practice of testing for lead pipes when completing routine maintenance and repair iii) Expand outreach programs to inform residents of the lead pipe testing program and the health dangers of lead pipes iv) Encourage District residents to have their pipes tested, and replaced if necessary SEC. 1200.410 WARD 4 TRANSPORTATION a) The transportation network serving Ward 4 generally provides for the efficient movement of vehicles and goods and services. Traffic on major streets is heavy, particularly during the morning and evening peak rush hours. Georgia Avenue, North Capitol Street, 13th Street, Piney Branch Road, 14th Street, and 16th Street are the major north-south arterials and accommodate high traffic volume in the ward. Missouri Avenue, Riggs l~oad, Michigan Avenue and Kennedy Street are the primary east-west arterials with high traffic volume b) Private automobiles, buses and Metrorail are the primary means of transportation in and through the ward. Approximately 70 percent of the bus routes in the ward are along major north-south streets that converge in the city’s central business district. East-west bus service is along Upshur, Kennedy and Butternut streets, and largely feeds the Metro stations at Fort Torten and Takoma. Adjustments in transit bus service will be necessary when the Washington Metropolitan Area Transit Authority opens the Green Line’s U Street (in Ward 1) and Georgia Avenue/Petworth stations to Fort Totten in spring 1991 c) In most instances, public transportation is within reasonable walking distance to places of work, recreation and shopping. The Metro stations at Fort Torten and in Takoma provide a needed service, judging from increased ridership. With completion of the Green Line route 201 ENROLLED ORIGINAL through the ward, an additional increase in Metro ridership is expected. A feeder system to the new Green Line stations should be developed to improve transit service. Additional service, such as a jitney bus or publicly supported taxi service, may be necessary to provide adequate transit service to all ward residents, particularly the elderly and disabled d) Traffic management techniques and selected street modifications should be explored to better regulate traffic volume and flow, particularly where major development is proposed. The residential street system, however, has constraints that limit potential solutions to transportation problems. A reduction in local and commuter traffic from Ward 4 residential streets, with completion of the Metrorail Red and Green Lines, provides the best hope for the future. This effort is needed to maintain and improve public safety and to protect the environmental quality from the effects of noise, fumes, vibration and litter resulting from vehicular traffic e) Bicycling, a leisure and recreational activity, is also becoming an important mode of travel for some. The D.C. Bicycle Advisory Council and the Department of Public Works have made progress in updating the Transportation Bicycle Plan to promote bicycling as another link in the overall transportation system f) The city continues to monitor and evaluate traffic patterns and changes and their impact on adjacent areas. Sixteenth Street has been modified to include center islands as part of the plan to beautify the street and to channel traffic. Along i3th Street, the one-way rush hour directional flow was eliminated; curb parking on one side is permitted during rush hours. Continued improvement and better feeder service between neighborhoods and the Metro stations should encourage ridership on the Metro. The Residential Parking Permit program should continue to reduce commuter parking problems in neighborhoods. And, increases in parking rates in the downtown area are likely to discourage some use of the private automobile and encourage greater use of the Metrorail and bus systems SEC. 1200.411 WARD 4 OBJECTIVES FOR TRANSPORTATION "The objectives for transportation are 1) Support the living environment and commerce of the ward and the District and to support development objectives for expanded businesses, housing and job opportunities for ward residents 2) Support the construction of the complete Metrorail Green Line route in the District, especially in Ward 4, which includes the Georgia Avenue-Petworth and Fort Torten stations 3) Complete the entire Metrorail system in the District to reduce regional dependence on the private passenger automobile in order to improve air quality and reduce congestion 4) Encourage adequate short-term on- and off-street parking to meet the needs of increased retail development at designated locations 5) Provide for improved traffic flow in Ward 4, through appropriate traffic management techniques 6) Promote alternatives to the private passenger automobile including public transit and especially bicycling and walking, by providing additional pedestrian paths and bicycle routes and facilities. 202 ENROLLEO ORIGINAL "SEC. 1200. 412 WARD 4 ACTIONS IN SUPPORT OF TRANSPORTATION "The policies in support of transporation are as follows 1) Improve traffic flow and safety through improved lighting, signage, pavement markings, traffic islands, and other transportation system management measures for the following streets: Georgia Avenue, North Capitol Street, 14th Street, Missouri Avenue, New Hampshire Avenue, Kennedy Street A) Traffic management strategies should be used to separate local traffic from through traffic in residential neighborhoods. Through traffic should be routed around identified neighborhood enclaves, where possible, onto arterial streets. The highway and street system should be studied for overall improved traffic flow, particularly in and through the ward’s commercial areas and along arterial streets B) Recommended actions i) Increase enforcement to reduce and prevent vehicles from illegally parking and/or blocking street lanes (double parking ii) Evaluate the future transportation improvement needs in terms of additional bus routes, four-way stop signs, signalization of traffic lights, turn lanes and increased number of parking spaces iii) Improve the maintenance, repair, reconstruction and redesign of streets and alleys, as needed iv) Continue to require developers to provide appropriate traffic studies and mitigation measures prior to major development, as part of the city’s zoning, subdivision, Large Tract Review, and permit processes 2) Encourage increased citizen participation in the review process during the preparation of the final Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA) for the proposed Metrorail Green Line through Ward 4 A) The Washington Metropolitan Area Transit Authority (WMATA) has prepared a draft of the Environmental Impact Assessment on alternative future Metrorail subway routes from the U Street/Cardozo Metrorail Station to Columbia Heights (in Ward 1 and the Georgia Avenue-Petworth and Fort Torten Metro stations in Ward 4 to ensure the least amount of neighborhood disruption. The draft report is available from WMATA, and public hearings are set for February 1991 B) Recommended actions i) Encourage private citizens, civic organizations, and Advisory Neighborhood Commission (ANCs) to review and comment on the draft (EIA) prepared by WMATA ii) Continue to support financing and construction of the Metrorail Green Line from the U Street/Cardozo Station, including the Columbia Heights and Georgia Avenue/Petworth stations iii) Minimize disruption to ward neighborhoods from construction of the Metro Green Line, particularly from construction of the Metrorail stations 3) Discourage the use of long-term commuter parking in the vicinity of proposed commercial development areas, including the Georgia and Piney Branch Post Office/Medical Building, Shepherd Park Public 203 ENROLLED ORIGINAL pedestrian safety, needed. Library and the Georgia Avenue Safeway; also to give parking preference to those on business errands A) Traffic and parking mana{,~ement programs are needed for commercial development to improve the present parking situation in the ward’s commercial areas B) Recommended actions i) Continue to implement the District’s parking enforcement program to prevent commuter parking along commercial, arterial, and residential streets ii) Continue to provide adequate direction on parking issues as it relates to proposals for rezoning and development before the Zoning Commission and the Board of Zoning Adjustment 4) Eliminate visual obstructions near traffic signs, including hanging tree limbs and bushes, which may create hazardous traffic conditions A) A problem exists at a number of intersections in the ward where overhanging tree-limbs, bushes, utility poles and other visual obstructions block or obscure the view of traffic signals and signs by both drivers and pedestrians. This has been both the cause and indirect cause of a number of accidents in the ward that might otherwise have been avoided B) Recommended actions i) Continue implementation of the city’s tree and beautification program to trim trees and other landscaping on public land throughout the ward to eliminate hazardous conditions ii) Continue to encourage residents of the District to identify areas where hazardous conditions exist around traffic signs iii) Work with PEPCO, D.C. Cable and citizens to relocate utility poles that obstruct the view of traffic, traffic signals and signs 5) Prevent automobiles from speeding, creating hazardous conditions for other vehicles and pedestrians A) Speeding vehicles are a safety hazard, particularly around the Fort Torten Metro Station; near the Keene Elementary School and the Maurice D. Lee School for the handicapped; the corner of the 6400 block of North Capitol Street; and the intersections of Tuckerman Street and Kansas Avenue N.W. and Georgia Avenue and 16th Street, N.W B) l%ecommended actions i) Develop a comprehensive approach to pedestrian safety ii) Evaluate and monitor methods to increase especially the use of four-way stop signs where iii) Install the latest technological devices at key locations in the ward to monitor and curtail the violation of traffic laws, such as exceeding the speed limit and running red traffic lights SEC. 1200.413 WAleD 4 PUBLIC FACILITIES a) The District’s public facilities program is focused on improving and maintaining the city’s existing infrastructure, including public health facilities, recreation centers, schools, public libraries, senior citizens’ 204 ENROLLED ORIGINAL centers, facilities for persons with mental or physical impairments, and police and fire stations b) The District’s Department of Recreation and Parks and, in certain instances, federal programs and facilities (such as Rock Creek Park, Fort Stevens and Fort Totten) provide a broad range of physical, cultural and social activities, both indoor and outdoor, to Ward 4 residents. The ward has 13 recreation centers, 5 swimming pools, 14 tennis courts and a variety of playgrounds, ball fields and special programs such as a youth garden and day camps c) The principal recreation concerns in Ward 4 include the rehabilitation of all facilities and the expansion of recreational programs for all age groups. The Petworth Recreation Center, which has just been rehabilitated, will present programs for groups ranging from pre-schooI children to senior citizens. Programs for teenagers, however, should be emphasized. Community-oriented recreation programs that offer a variety of services year round are needed for children and young adults in the Takoma and Shepherd Park neighborhoods. ’~(d) The D.C. Public Schools currently have 14 elementary schools, 3 junior high schools, 2 high schools, 2 special education schools and 1 career development center in Ward 4. These schools provide a well-balanced education system for the ward’s students e) There are three public libraries in the ward offering a wide range of resources and services. They are Takoma Park, Petworth and the new branch library at Shepherd Park f) Three fire stations and the Fourth District Police Headquarters on Georgia Avenue provide public safety services g) Currently, there are no general public health facilities in the ward that provide a broad range of health services to ward residents, particularly to the needy. There are two specialized public health facilities in the ward, the Sharpe Health School, which provides services for only young people with disabilities, and the Upshur Street Dental Clinic SEC. 1200.414 WARD 4 OBJECTIVES FOR PUBLIC FACILITIES "The objectives for public facilities are 1) Develop and implement strategies to assure that future demand for services will be adequate and responsive to community needs 2) Ensure coordinated planning, construction, renovation and maintenance of public facilities for an adequate public service delivery system 3) Locate public facilities to provide optimum service to Ward 4 residents and support social development and neighborhood improvement objectives for the ward 4) Regularly review the need for new public facilities and the condition of existing facilities 5) Develop a District-wide public facilities plan that incorporates the development of programs and additional facilities to address social service and capital infrastructure needs SEC. 1200.415 WARD 4 ACTIONS IN SUPPORT OF PUBLIC FACILITIES "The policies in support of pub||c facilities are as follows: 205 ENROLLED ORIGINAL 1) Complete an assessment of all existing recreational facilities in the ward to determine if there is a need for improvement, upgrading, or expansion A) The District-wide public facilities plan should identify needs for new or replacement facilities, facilities to be retained, and facilities and sites no longer needed by the public B) Recommended actions i) Determine the condition of all ward recreational facilities and improve them as required ii) Implement the public facilities plan to meet current and future needs of ward residents, particularly in the more densely populated and expanding neighborhoods iii) Provide funding for a broad range of recreation facilities and programs for teenagers to encourage them to get off the streets 2) Establish an information system to provide data on the status and condition of all vacant District-owned properties A) An information system that details the condition and needs assessments of District-owned property could be used to develop the public facility master plan. The data could also assist in the preparation of proposals to dispose of or reuse surplus or underused District property B) l~ecommended actions i) Prepare a comprehensive inventory of all District-owned vacant land in the ward using the Municipal Automated Geographic Information System (MAGIS) and the Comprehensive Plan policy maps. The inventory should document current use, zoning, square footage, assessed value and potential for development ii) tteview and recommend appropriate uses for underused District land and facilities that could benefit city agencies or the surrounding community 3) Ensure that public facilities and accessory facilities throughout the ward are accessible to persons with disabilities A) All public facilities and facilities receiving public assistance should be handicapped accessible. This may include wheelchair ramps and handicapped-equipped restrooms and other accommodations for the disabled. The Architectural Barrier Free Law, D.C. Law 3-76, dated July 1, 1986, requires that architectural barriers to those with disabilities be eliminated from all public facilities B) Recommended action: New public and publicly assisted housing should be built without architectural barriers and existing facilities should be rehabilitated, where needed,to remove any physical barriers to those who are disabled SEC. 1200.416 WAleD 4 UI~BAN DESIGN a) A number of areas and neighborhoods in Ward 4 have noteworthy design qualities, including historic Takoma with its Victorian buildings, the Portal Estates with its modern houses, Crestwood with its elegant older houses, and recently enhanced 16th Street with its stately old homes. The ward also has the somewhat discordant group of buildings fronting the low density Georgia Avenue commercial strip and the shorter Kennedy Street commercial area. However, what gives Ward 4 its primary character is its very low density residential development. Much of the 206 ENROLl.El) ORIGINAL ward is developed with single-family houses, both detached and attached. This, coupled with the large institutional open spaces of the U.S. Soldiers and Airmen’s Home, Walter l~eed Army Medical Center, Gallaudet University West Campus and l~ock Creek Park, creates the perception of a ward that is truly park-like b) The District has established citywide goals to address urban design in its neighborhoods. These goals are 1) to promote the protection, enhancement and enjoyment of the natural environs and (2) to promote an environment that upgrades the District’s aesthetic qualities, emphasizes neighborhood identity and functions efficiently. Major objectives are to maintain and enhance the physical integrity and character of the District as the nation’s capital and to preserve and enhance the distinct physical qualities of each ward’s neighborhoods, commercial areas, and open space and parks c) The revitalization and development of Georgia Avenue and Kennedy Street and the appropriate development of the Takoma and Fort Torten Metrorail areas provide challenging opportunities for excellence in urban design. The opportunities in these Metro areas are particularly important because of the need to develop commercial design concepts that establish attractive, orderly environments with building signage, lighting, building materials and public space. The task of enhancing Georgia Avenue is of particular concern because of its "special street" designation in the Comprehensive Plan. Takoma is similarly an area of sensitive design due to its historic district designation in the Comprehensive Plan. Each area contains conditions that dictate special approaches to the resolution of urban design problems d) Further opportunities exist at the three gateways in the ward to provide urban design features that are symbolic and aesthetically pleasing and that imaginatively welcome visitors to the city. Gateways in Ward 4 are: 16th Street, Georgia Avenue, and New Hampshire Avenue. These entry points are important because they provide visitors their first contact with the city. In addition, well-designed places of entry give residents and commuters an immediate frame of reference and sense of arrival when entering the city and ward SEC. 1200.417 WARD 4 OBJECTIVES FOI~ URBAN DESIGN "The objectives for urban design are 1) Preserve and enhance the physical qualities and character of Ward 4’s neighborhoods through preservation and enhancement of its built and natural environment 2) Encourage well-designed developments in areas that are vacant, underused or deteriorated. Such areas include: Georgia Avenue, Kennedy Street and the Takoma and Fort Torten Metrorail Station planning areas. Developments in these locations should have a strong physical identity SEC. 1200.418 WARD 4 ACTIONS IN SUPPORT OF URBAN DESIGN "The policies in support of urban design are as follows i) Develop streetscape design guidelines to enhance the aesthetic and historic qualities of the ward’s special streets and historic sites and landmarks, as well as the ward’s gateways into the city A) High quality design for new developments must be encouraged throughout Ward 4 to provide a strong, positive physical 207 ENROLLED ORIGINAL identity that enhances the low scale of its neighborhoods and park-like qualities. Special attention should be given to special streets, gateways and Metro station areas B) Recommended actions i) Include appropriate urban design guidelines in small area plans prepared for Ward 4 communities ii) Explore and identify initiatives to protect and enhance the aesthetic and historic qualities of special streets, gateways and historic features iii) Include urban design guidelines as part of joint development plans around Metrorail stations where new development is proposed. ’T(iv) Develop visual identification devices and special design plans to define the DistricCs edges and to create strong characteristic gateways at the District’s borders 2) Encourage landscape and site improvements in Ward 4 to enhance public facilities, public sites and residential neighborhoods adjacent to commercial and industrial areas, including Metrorail lines A) New development must be encouraged, especially in areas with vacant or underused land, to provide a strong, positive physical identity that enhances the low scale, park-like qualities of the ward B) Recommended actions i) Develop a program for the improvement and maintenance of the city’s small parks in Ward 4 ii) Support the community in conducting an inventory and compiling a list of public sites that need major landscape and site improvements to enhance the adjacent communities iii) Develop landscape standards for public facilities and other nonpark public sites iv) Develop a text amendment to the Zoning Regulations that require landscape buffers between residential areas and Production and Technical Employment areas 3) Encourage buffers between commercial, industrial and residential uses, especially in the Petworth, Takoma and Lamond-Riggs neighborhoods A) Residential areas adjacent to commercial or industrial areas need to be protected from the potential adverse impact of new development B) Recommended action: Develop a text amendment to the Zoning Regulations that require landscape buffers between residential areas adjoining Production and Technical Employment areas. ’~SEC. 1200.419 WARD 4 PRESERVATION AND HISTORIC FEATURES a) Ward 4 has a number of important local and national historic features. During the Civil War, President Lincoln observed combat at Fort Stevens (13th Street and Piney Branch Road) between Union and Confederate forces during a southern invasion of the national capital. Fort Stevens, along with other parts of the Fort Circle Park System, is a designated landmark on the National l~egister of Historic places. The Battleground NationaI Cemetery, where those who died at Fort Stevens 208 ENROLLED ORIGINAL defending the Union are buried, is located on Georgia Avenue near Fort Stevens b) Other important historic features in the ward are the Takoma Historic District, Fort Torten, Fort Slocum and Rock Creek Park. In a spirit of cooperation, the city, ward residents and the federal government should upgrade the forts that were used to protect the capital city during the Civil War c) The District is considering a historic survey of the Georgia Avenue corridor, a particularly timely undertaking given the extensive redevelopment and revitalization efforts that are underway or being proposed. Urban design guidelines are also being considered to help improve the appearance of buildings along Georgia Avenue and Kennedy Street. Properties meriting designation as historic landmarks, historic districts or listing in the National Register of Historic Places should be identified through a comprehensive survey that covers every aspect of the prehistory and history of the ward and the national capital d) Potential historic properties, which could be modified or demolished inadvertently as a result of revitalization, need to be identified and protected. Historic preservation goals for the ward, as derived from the Comprehensive Plan, encourage the protection of irreplaceable historic and cultural resources. The District is providing sustained regulatory enforcement and relevant programs to protect and enhance historic resources. The Washington Metropolitan Area Transit Authority has suggested that a number of neighborhoods along the Green Line route be surveyed. They include the areas near the proposed Georgia Avenue/Petwortb Metrorail Station and the Petworth and Crestwood neighborhoods e) In Takoma, Metro has begun to stimulate revitalization of the commercial district. The proposed Takoma mini-park will also be a community benefit, offering benches, landscaping, informational kiosks, water fountains and a visually attractive setting. The issue of expanding the Takoma Historic District boundary also must be fully explored f) Every effort should be made to provide for the continued, appropriate use of all historic properties. If the original use or a reasonable intensification of the original use is no longer feasible, appropriate adaptive reuses consistent with applicable land use regulations should be encouraged SEC. 1200.420 WARD 4 OBJECTIVES FOR PRESERVATION AND HISTORIC FEATURES "The objectives for preservation and historic features are 1) Preserve important historic features while permitting new development that is compatible with those features 2) Increase public awareness of facilities and places of historic and archaeological significance in Ward 4 3) Enhance and protect historic resources through regulatory enforcement, and expand the public notification system to inform the Ward 4 community about pending District government actions that are historically related 4) Identify properties and neighborhoods in Ward 4 meriting designation as historic landmarks, historic districts or listing in the National Register of Historic Places through comprehensive surveys; and 209 ENROLLED ORIGINAL 5) Explore the use of the National Trust for Historic Preservation’s "Main Street" programs as a means of helping to revitalize ward neighborhood and multi-neighborhood commercial centers SEC. 1200.421 WARD 4 ACTIONS IN SUPPORT OF PRESERVATION AND HISTORIC FEATURES "The policies in support of preservation and historic features are as follows 1) Conduct a historical survey to identify potential historic buildings and areas in Ward 4 A) It is likely that there are a number of buildings or areas in Ward 4 that have not been identified and designated as historic. It is important to recognize and save the ward’s historic and valued heritage before significant buildings are destroyed or altered B) Recommended actions i) Undertake a comprehensive historic survey, with community participation, of Petworth, Crestwood, Brightwood, Shepherd Park North Portal Estates and Colonial Village ii) Develop methods to highlight historic landmarks in the ward, including the Fort Circle Parks, the Lucinda Caddy House, the Takoma Historic District, and the designated gateways into the city iii) Survey areas of potential historic significance in the Takoma neighborhood to expand the historic district to include appropriate structures and places SEC. 1200.422 WAItD 4 HUMAN SERVICES a) A full range of physical and mental health care and human services should be available to District residents who require assistance, including the elderly, dependent families, the homeless, the physically and mentally impaired, and others b) Human services focus on the prevention and control of disease; provision of medical and health care; provision of financial assistance and social services; vocational rehabilitation services; and veterans’ services. The involvement of community leaders, government agencies, service providers, private citizens and consumers is important to ensure that high quality human services are available and affordable c) Day care, income assistance, educational improvement, employment assistance, maternity and child care, counseling, transportation and housing assistance are just a few of the many human service needs of Ward 4 residents. Although the federal government provides some assistance, recent budget cuts have shifted a greater share of the burden of providing social assistance to the private sector and local governments. Infants, youths, adults and the elderly population, who are unable to secure basic services without assistance, are being adversely affected by the budget cuts d) The Ward 4 community has an increasingly large elderly population requiring additional services. Approximately 14 percent of the population is 65 years of age and above and about 37 percent was between 45 and 64 years of age during the 1980 census. The increase in the elderly population has serious implications for health service needs in general. For the elderly population, a major priority is the establishment of a comprehensive senior citizens center in Ward 4. 210 ENROLLED ORIGINAL e) Public Safety is a major concern among the residents in Ward 4, particularly from drug related criminal activity. The Metropolitan Police Department has the responsibility to protect and maintain the public safety of individual merchants and institutions in the District of Columbia SEC. 1200.423 WARD 4 OBJECTIVES FOR HUMAN SERVICES "The objectives for human services are 1) Improve public safety and security for all ward residents 2) Promote the accessibility of quality primary care services at reasonable cost in all neighborhoods of the ward 3) Provide information to the community on health and social services offered by the District 4) Provide social service information on a continuing basis through reports, displays, exhibits, presentations and meetings 5) Continue to enforce and monitor the community-based residential facilities program to ensure that the needs of residents and clients who require this service are met, and that community concerns and issues associated with the program are adequately addressed 6) Provide special programs for the youth, elderly, and persons with physical and mental impairments within the ward SEC. 1200.424 WARD 4 ACTIONS IN SUPPORT OF HUMAN SERVICES "The policies in support of human services are as follows I) Focus public attention on crime infested areas A) Activities such as prostitution and drug trafficking exist along 14th Street and Kennedy Street N.W. and near some public schools. Citizens have expressed concerns about the proliferation of drug trafficking in the ward and its associated violence and litter. Decreased property values also result from these activities B) l~ecommended actions i) Encourage neighborhood patrols to address the drug and crime problems throughout the ward ii) Increase public awareness and public information, including fact sheets on public safety services, to assist Ward 4 residents and businesses iii) Initiate new programs and means to more effectively combat crime, particularly drug related violence and prostitution 2) Increase the availability and accessibility of public health services for the youth who are mentally and physically disabled, the homeless, and the elderly A) Quality primary care services should be promoted in parts of the ward at reasonable cost, especially in medically underserved and critical staff-shortage areas B) Recommended actions i) Evaluate existing services and the need for additional health services in the ward ii) Distribute information in the community regarding health and social services offered by the District to residents at little or no cost. 211 ENROLLED ORIGINAL iii) Implement services for the handicapped, mentally and physically impaired youth, the homeless and the elderly population 3) Provide increased information on city services to ward residents A) Ward residents need better access to information about city services. Information on various programs should be routinely provided through reports, dis plays, exhibits, presentations and meetings B) Recommended action: Improve community outreach programs and accessibility of information to Advisory Neighborhood Commissions, churches and community groups 4) Monitor new and existing community-based residential facilities (CBRFs) in the ward to ensure their compliance with zoning regulations A) Ward 4 has a large number of community-based residential facilities. The District government needs to coordinate with the community to improve communications regarding the establishment of these facilities to ensure that they are compatible with the neighborhoods in which they are located and that they do not exceed an appropriate number for the ward, compared to the number throughout the city B) Recommended actions i) Establish strategies and procedures for conducting a community outreach program to enhance community awareness and understanding of CBRFs ii) Consider establishment of a community advisory board to facilitate more community involvement in the CBRF process, including Advisory Neighborhood Commissioners, civic groups, church representatives and other concerned citizens iii) Review and improve the system that is used to inform the community of the potential location of a CBRF in their neighborhood 5) Increase dissemination of information to persons with disabilities to better inform them of their human and legal rights and of available services A) Many District residents with physical or mental disabilities are not aware of the services they are available or where that can go to receive assistance B) Recommended actions i) Provide additional information to community groups and Advisory Neighborhood Commissions regarding services offered by the District to persons with disabilities ii) Develop a comprehensive statement of human and legal rights and services available for persons with disabilities in the areas of housing, transportation, employment, public facilities, recreation and human services in Ward 4 iii) Establish a Ward 4 committee to coordinate with the Mayor’s Committee on Handicapped Individuals, the Office of Community-Based Residential Facilities, the D.C. Association for Retarded Citizens, Inc. and private institutions to promote the rights of and increased services to persons with disabilities. 212 ENROLLED ORIGINAL 6) Design and coordinate services and policies in health care, housing, transportation and recreation to make it possible for senior citizens and persons with disabilities to remain independent A) The increasing number of senior citizens in Ward 4 will require services and facilities to address their needs B) l~ecommended actions i) Identify elderly citizens without adequate income/assets or family, and plan for their needs and services ii) Increase coordination of services and activities among District agencies so that the elderly can continue to contribute to their communities iii) Increase the dissemination of information in the community regarding health and social services offered by the District for the elderly SEC. 1200.425 WARD 4 LAND USE/ZONING ’~(a) Ward 4 has approximately 3,720 acres of land, excluding public rights-of-way, and ranks fifth in total land area among the city’s eight wards. The basic land uses in Ward 4 are residential, commercial, institutional, open space and industrial b) Residential uses cover 1,650 acres, or 44 percent, of the ward’s land, the second largest amount of residential land in the city. Ward 3 has the largest amount; 95 percent of its land is in residential use. Most of the residential land in Ward 4 (1,450 acres) is developed in low density, single-family detached, semi-detached and row houses. Moderate density, multi-family uses occupy relatively few acres of land but make up about 40 percent of all the housing units in the ward. Detached and semi-detached units are located primarily in the northern and western sections, and row houses are predominant in the southern residential areas c) Ward 4 has a much lower residential density (about 49 persons per residential acre) than most other wards. Ward 3 has the lowest density, 27 persons per acre. Residential densities vary among the neighborhoods within Ward 4 d) Commercial uses cover 110 acres of the land area in Ward 4. Generally, a combination of low density, neighborhood and multi-neighborhood centers are the main commercial development. The bulk of commercial uses is concentrated along Georgia Avenue which extends the north-south length of the ward. Additional commercial activity is located along Kennedy Street, Riggs l~oad and in the Takoma neighborhood. Neighborhood-serving commercial facilities need to be upgraded and expanded throughout the ward e) Major institutional uses, such as the U.S. Soldiers and Airmen’s Home, Washington Hospital Center, Children’s Hospital and the Veterans Administration Hospital, are located in the southeastern section of the ward f) Residents of Ward 4 have expressed concerns about the recent increase in the number of churches in residential areas. They are particularly concerned about some church-related functions, such as day care centers, church-operated schools, recreation facilities and social service centers. Adverse effects such as noise, parking, traffic and litter are often by-products of these facilities and often disrupt quiet, stable neighborhoods. 213 ENROLLED ORIGINAL g) Vacant and recreation land occupy 1,050 acres, or 28 percent, of the ward’s land. This includes several parks--Rock Creek Park, Fort Torten, Fort Slocum and Fort Stevens--as well as the Carter Barton Amphitheater, Rock Creek Cemetery and open recreational space at Roosevelt and Coolidge high schools h) Only 6 acres of the ward’s land is used for industrial uses. Industrial development next to the predominantly low density residential neighborhoods in Ward 4 is a major concern, particularly in the Takoma, Petworth and Lamond-Riggs neighborhoods. This land use is cited most frequently as a problem, at the same time it is recognized that industrial development helps to provide needed employment opportunities and essential business services, as well as municipal tax revenues i) To preserve the stable qualities of the neighborhoods in Ward 4, appropriate buffering and screening techniques must be used to separate industrial development from nearby residential land uses. The expansion and location of industrial establishments should be limited to Production and Technical Employment (PTE) areas, as defined on the District of Columbia Generalized Land Use Map j) The Ward 4 Plan recognizes that the ward is largely developed and that changes will result from reuse and in-fill development on the few remaining vacant lots. Land use planning for the ward must protect and enhance the low density character, open spaces and stable neighborhoods for which the ward is known. This is the major objective of the ward plan k) The key land use concerns in Ward 4 include 1) Preserving, protecting, and stabilizing the ward’s residential neighborhoods 2) Controlling the encroachment of commercial and other nonresidential uses into residential areas, a problem particularly disturbing in the residential areas abutting 16th Street, Georgia Avenue and Kennedy Street 3) Increased numbers of nonresidential uses in residential neighborhoods causing negative impacts such as parking, traffic, noise, inadequate screening, and inadequate off-street parking 4) Revitalizing Georgia Avenue and other major commercial areas in the ward; and 5) Reducing the adverse affects of industrial development, such as noise, truck traffic, litter and lack of visual compatibility, on nearby residential neighborhoods 1) The development of the areas surrounding the Fort Torten Metro Station, the proposed Georgia Avenue-Petworth Metro Station and the Takoma Metro Station are critical to the ward’s future. Other important land use priorities are the development of commercial nodes along Georgia Avenue, Riggs Road, and Kennedy Street, and the appropriate reuse of the industrial area in the vicinity of Upshur and Taylor streets m) Zoning 1) About 36 percent of the Ward 4 area is unzoned. This land, which totals 1,300 acres, is owned by the federal government and is primarily used for open space and institutional uses. The uses include: Rock Creek Park, Walter Reed Army Medical Center, U.S. Soldiers and Airmen’s Home and the Veterans Administration Hospital. 214 ENROLLED ORIGINAL 2) The remaining land in Ward 4 is zoned for residential, commercial or industrial uses. Following is a general description of zoning in the area n) l~esidential Zoning 1) The predominant zoning in Ward 4 is the single-family detached dwelling categories I~-I-A and I~-I-B, which comprise about 970 acres or 41 percent of the ward’s total land area. These zoning classifications reflect the low density, single-family detached housing scale and character of the ward. R-1-A and I~-I-B areas are primarily located west of 16th Street in Colonial Village, North Portal Estates and Crestwood, and in the Takoma and Shepherd Park neighborhoods 2) Single-family, low density semi-detached (R-2) and moderate density row dwellings (1~-3 and R-4) make up the second largest residentially zoned land (35 percent These zones are mapped primarily in the central and southern sections of the ward. A significant portion of this low and moderate density housing is located in the Manor Park, Petworth and Brightwood neighborhoods 3) Low, medium and high density apartment house zones (l~-5-A, R-5-B and 1~-5-C, respectively) total about 330 acres. They are primarily located in the eastern and central sections of the ward: east of North Capitol Street in the Fort Torten neighborhood, in the vicinity of Missouri Avenue, along l~iggs ]~oad and near 14th Street o) Industrial Zoning 1) Areas zoned for industrial uses are located primarily along the B&amp;amp;O Railroad right-of-way, which extends through the ward from the Fort Torten neighborhood to Takoma. There are also pockets of industrially zoned land in the Petwortb neighborhood at Taylor and Upshur streets and Decatur and Buchannan streets 2) In Ward 4, industrial zones (C-M-1 and M) make up five percent of the zoned land area. Land uses in these zones include warehouses, automotive uses and service/distribution businesses 3) Although the C-M-1 and M industrial zones represent the smallest land use category in the ward, they are a source of major land use conflicts. Many industrial parcels are adjacent to low and moderate density residential neighborhoods. The activities associated with industrial uses, in many instances, are incompatible or have adverse impacts on the residential areas. These impacts include heavy truck traffic, commuter parking, litter, noise, visual blight and open storage p) Commercial Zoning 1) The community business district (C-2-A) is primarily located along Georgia Avenue and Kennedy Street. The Georgia Avenue strip extends from Shepherd Park at the D.C. Maryland boundary through Brightwood Park and Petworth. The Kennedy Street strip is adjacent to the southern edge of Brightwood and Manor Park and extends along the northern edge of Brightwood Park. The eastern extension of the Kennedy Street (C-2-A) strip is interrupted by residential and industrial uses and the Metrorail and B&amp;amp;O railroad tracks. It ends in the neighborhood shopping area (C-l) at South Dakota Avenue and Riggs Road (Lamond-l~iggs Park neighborhood 2) A substantial concentration of C-2-A zoning is also mapped in Takoma adjacent to the Metro station. Other lesser C-2-A and C-1 areas that are mapped in the ward include 14th Street at Spring l~oad; Decatur Street and Colorado Avenue; Third and Upshur streets; Taylor 215 £NROLLED ORIGINAL Street and Hawaii Avenue; and Farragut Street and New Hampshire Avenue. Both C-2-A and C-1 zoning classifications make up only six percent, or approximately 130 acres, of the ward’s zoned land area SEC. 1200.426 WARD 4 OBJECTIVES FOR LAND USE/ZONING "The objectives for ]and use/zoning are 1) Protect and enhance existing residential neighborhoods 2) Protect the ward’s residential areas from incompatible land uses and from activities generating excessive traffic, parking, noise, litter and other damaging environmental impacts 3) Protect residential neighborhoods from concentrations of nonresidential facilities through code enforcement and appropriate District regulations that would guide development 4) Encourage development of adequate neighborhood shopping and support services 5) Promote the vitality of the ward’s commercial areas and to increase employment and economic growth 6) Encourage the appropriate and compatible development of land adjacent to the Fort Torten and Takoma Metrorail stations 7) Encourage mixed-use development with expanded employment opportunities in the Fort Torten Metrorail Station Special Treatment Area, as identified in the Comprehensive Plan 8) Continue to enforce the strict application of housing, building and zoning codes in Ward 4 9) Increase the supply of child care facilities in each residential and commercial area within the ward 10) Coordinate land use decisions applicable to Ward 4 with Comprehensive Plan provisions, to revise land use regulations to incorporate appropriate changes in the ward and to establish procedures for monitoring public and private land use actions for consistency with the Comprehensive Plan Land Use Elements and accompanying Plan Maps SEC. 1200. 427 WARD 4 ACTIONS IN SUPPORT OF LAND USE/ZONING "The policies in support of land use/zoning are as follows 1) Determine the appropriate mix, scale, intensity and design of development in the Fort Torten Metrorai] Special Treatment Area. The Fort Totten Metrorail Special Treatment Area is bounded by Baltimore &amp;amp; Ohio Railroad tracks on the west, Gallatin Street N.W. on the north, South Dakota Avenue to the east and Buchanan Street N.W. on the south A) Construction of the new MetroraiI Green Line route from U Street to the Fort Torten Metrorail Station will provide development potential for areas surrounding the station. However, the type of development that would be appropriate for this area remains an issue. Possible uses include commercial offices, retail goods, services and/or affordable market rate housing. Potential adverse impacts of any new development on the surrounding communities may include increased traffic, noise and litter. Customer and commuter parking spaces are also a major concern B) l~ecommended actions i) Prepare a small area study of the area to determine the appropriate mix, scale, intensity and design of development. 216 ENROLLED ORIGINAL ii) Provide assistance to private developers, as resources permit, that will facilitate commercial and retail development to support the residential population in the area iii) Work with the Washington Metropolitan Area Transit Authority (WMATA through the joint development review process, to ensure that development on WMATA-owned property contributes to and is compatible with the existing character of the surrounding neighborhood 2) Provide for the stability and maintenance of residential neighborhoods, like 16th Street Heights, Brightwood, Crestwood, Petworth and Shepherd Park, by assuring adequate controls to protect against adverse impacts from nonresidential uses such as churches, day care centers, and other institutional uses A) The Office of Planning (OP) completed a preliminary study of the Brightwood Park/16th Street Heights neighborhood based on concerns of the 16th Street Heights Civic Association about the increasing number of nonresidential uses in their residentially zoned neighborhood. A preliminary analysis reveals a number of adverse impacts, including parking, noise, litter and loss of residential character, that should be mitigated. There is the need for code compliance investigations of questionable or illegal uses such as boarding and rooming houses B) l~ecommended actions i) A zoning overlay district that places enhanced restrictions on off-street parking, concentrations per block and/or blockface, and screening should be enacted by the Zoning Commission. Mitigate any traffic, parking and related safety problems on local residential streets that are the consequence of nonresidential uses, such as churches in residential neighborhoods, through strict enforcement of the zoning and other municipal regulations ii) Develop a citywide zoning text amendment including provisions dealing with bulk, density and height permitted in residential zones, to more effectively control nonresidential uses, and to provide greater stability and protection for nearby residential development iii) Increase code enforcement and inspection of all nonresidential uses in residential zones to ensure compliance with the existing regulations, l~esponsible Agency(s Department of Consumer and ttegulatory Affairs (DCI~A 3) Complete a Takoma Metrorail Station Area Study to determine the appropriate mix, scale, intensity and design of development A) The area near the intersection of Blair l~oad and Cedar Street, N.W has been the subject of a number of land use proposals. Any development in this area may adversely impact existing nearby residential development and the Takoma historic district B) l~ecommended actions i) Conduct a study and prepare an action plan to determine the appropriate mix of uses, scale and intensity of development at the Takoma Metrorail Station to ensure compatibility with existing development. 217 ENROLLED ORIGINAL I~(ii) Provide land use and zoning actions that encourage new and accommodate existing town houses and garden apartment development iii) Coordinate new commercial development activities around the Takoma Metrorail Station area through the Joint Development Review Process iv) Develop design criteria that will protect and preserve the historic character of the area v) Develop control mechanisms to protect and preserve the existing low scale residential uses in the vicinity of the station vi) Enhance citizen participation in the development review process to assist the District agencies and WMATA to respond to community concerns 4) Conduct an analysis of nodal versus strip commercial development for Georgia Avenue and Kennedy Street, and Georgia and New Hampshire avenues to assess development alternatives A) The Georgia Avenue corridor, the longest commercial strip in the ward, needs revitalizing. Studies should focus on nodal commercial development along Georgia, Eastern and Alaska avenues; Georgia and Missouri avenues; Georgia Avenue and Upshur Street; Georgia and New Hampshire avenues; and other potential sites. W(B) Recommended actions i) Initiate small area studies for Georgia and Missouri avenues; Georgia Avenue and Upshur Street; Georgia and Eastern avenues; Georgia and New Hampshire avenues; and Georgia and Alaska avenues to determine commercial uses that would be more beneficial to the residents in the area ii) Improve streets, sidewalks and lighting in commercial areas iii) Support proposals and projects specifically geared toward nodal or cluster development on Georgia Avenue and Kennedy Street iv) Up grade deficient neighborhood and multi-neighborhood shopping and service areas on Georgia Avenue, between Eastern and Alaska avenues, and other identified areas v) Use economic, regulatory and capital improvement programs to spur improvements in existing community and neighborhood shopping areas vi) Renovate and upgrade commercial areas in designated locations, like Georgia and Missouri avenues and the corner of 14th Street and Colorado Avenue, to ensure that all neighborhoods have access to a suitable range of services vii) Monitor commercial areas where adverse conditions (traffic, noise, safety, parking, crime and litter) are being experienced and provide appropriate regulatory action to alleviate the problems 5) Revitalize the wardts commercial areas and maintain the multi-use character of major commercial strips and nodes, while preserving the essential qualities of the ward’s many stable residential neighborhoods that are in close proximity to commercial areas A) Commercial uses in Ward 4 are encroaching on residential areas, particularly residential neighborhoods that abut Georgia 218 ENROLLED ORIGINAL Avenue and Kennedy Street and the t~iggs P~oad commercial area; along 14th Street and Colorado Avenue; and in the Takoma neighborhood. The revitalization of the ward’s commercial areas without infringement on nearby residential areas is crucial. ’ (B) l~ecommended actions i) 1)romote a nodal commercial concept on Georgia, Missouri and Eastern avenues and Piney Branch Road ii) Maintain and encourage the multi-use character and vitality of residential and commercial uses on Georgia Avenue, Kennedy Street, 14th Street and in Takoma; and discourage the extension of commercial activity into the abutting residential neighborhoods 6) Examine the negative impacts on residential areas resulting from locating fast food restaurants and 24-hour convenience stores in neighborhood commercial areas and on major arterials A) The growing number of fast food and 24-hour convenience stores in neighborhood commercial areas often cause negative physical impacts, such as traffic, noise, litter and parking on nearby residential streets. In addition, parking on major arterials, especially Georgia Avenue, often blocks or impedes the flow of traffic B) Recommended actions i) Identify areas where negative impacts (traffic, noise, parking, litter, safety, etc are being experienced ii) Encourage increased parking enforcement in current problem areas such as Georgia Avenue between Geranium and Hemlock streets and between Fifth and Kennedy streets iii) Continue to vigorously enforce the citywide regulations on food delivery service establishments 7) To eliminate and mitigate negative impacts that existing industrial development has on nearby residential areas, primarily in the Takoma, Petworth, Lamond-l~iggs and Fort Torten neighborhoods A) Residential neighborhoods must be protected from nearby industrial uses and activities that generate excessive traffic, noise, litter and other damaging environmental impacts. Such uses are near the Takoma, Petworth, and Lamonds-l~iggs neighborhoods. In the Takoma neighborhood, for example, along Blair Road N.W a gas station and commercial garage is on the corner of Fourth and Blair ttoad N.W. in a C-M-1 (low bulk) industrial zone. It is surrounded by an l~-5-A (low density) residential zone, between Cedar and Whittier streets. The gas station is the source of heavy traffic, noise and fumes emitted into the air from automobiles B) ]~ecommended actions i) Initiate studies of industrial areas in the Takoma and Lamond-l~iggs neighborhoods and complete the study of the Upshur/Taylor Street industrial area. The studies should deal with an appropriate level of industrial and commercial development while ensuring compatibility with and buffering of surrounding residential uses ii) Direct major new industrial development, as well as existing uses that adversely affect residential neighborhoods, to the city’s industrial parks and areas that are designated for industrial uses, such as the New York Avenue corridor 8) Evaluate and recommend appropriate changes to the District of Columbia Zoning Regulations and Map to make them consistent with the Comprehensive Plan, as amended by D.C. Law 8-129. 219 ENROLLED ORIGINAL 11(A) l~evise and update the D.C. Zoning l~egulations and Map to conform them with the densities and uses indicated in the Comprehensive Plan, as amended. D.C. Law 8-129, the Comprehensive Plan Amendments Act of 1989, identifies areas in the ward where zoning and land use may be inconsistent with the Comprehensive Plan as amended by the act. The law recommends change to a number of land use designations in the ward from those that were previously approved. Where the new land use designations will not be consistent with existing zoning, the zoning, particularly on major ward commercial and residential streets, should be changed in accordance with the Comprehensive Plan B) l~ecommended actions i) Conduct a further survey and analysis of land uses and zoning in Ward 4 to identify locations where zoning and land uses are not consistent and submit findings and recommendations to the Zoning Commission for action ii) Prepare reports to the Zoning Commission recommending appropriate rezoning actions to make ward zoning not inconsistent with the Comprehensive Plan. w~(iii) Monitor the update of the Comprehensive Plan Land Use Map, in accordance with D.C. Law 8-129, as follows The mixed-use moderate density commercial and moderate density residential area on Georgia Avenue N.W between the south side of Alaska Avenue N.W and Fern Street N.W is included in the mixed-use low density commercial and low density residential land use category Focus the commercial usage in the moderate density mixed use area bounded generally by Georgia Avenue N.W Eastern Avenue N.W Alaska Avenue N.W and Kalmia Avenue N.W with retail use being the only commercial use to focus on Eastern Avenue N.W Georgia Avenue N.W between Decatur Street N.W and Allison Street N.W is included in the moderate density residential land use category The area bounded by Upshur Street N.W Shepherd Street N.W Georgia Avenue N.W and 13th Street N.W. is included in the mixed-use moderate density residential and low density commercial land use category The intersection of Georgia Avenue N.W. and Upshur Street N.W. is a new and upgraded local neighborhood center symbol The area bounded by Park Place N.W the Soldiers and AirmenTs Home, the Washington Hospital Center and the McMillan t~eservoir is included in the federal land use category The northwest corner of the intersection of Taylor Street N.W. and Hawaii Avenue N.W is included in the low density commercial land use category The area bounded by Eastern Avenue N.W Laurel Avenue N.W Aspen Street N.W Fourth Street N.W Blair Road N.W. and Chestnut Street N.W is included in the mixed-use low density residential and low density commercial land category Kennedy Street N.W between 13th Street N.W. and North Capitol Street N.W is included in the mixed-use moderate density residential and low density commercial land use category Georgia Avenue N.W, between Gallatin Street and Madison Street N.W is included in the mixed-use moderate density residential and low density commercial land use category. 220 ENROLLED ORIGINAL 16th Street N.W between Kennedy Street N.W. and Jefferson Street N.W is included in the low density residential land use category The area bounded by the west side of Sandy Spring Road N.W Whittier Street N.W Van Buren Street N.W and the railroad tracks is included in the low density commercial land use category A small area action plan shall be prepared for: The square bounded by Upshur Street N.W Shepherd Street N.W 13th Street N.W and Georgia Avenue N.W. to implement an upgrade local neighborhood centers for the area 9) Commercial zoning in the following areas needs to be re-evaluated to determine viability, needs and potential options for redevelopment: Ninth Street, between Upshur and Taylor streets; Colorado Avenue, between Longfellow and Jefferson streets; 14th Street, between Decatur and Allison streets A) A number of commercial areas are not specifically dealt with in D.C. law 8-129. Many of these areas have suffered for a number of years from declining commercial activities and blight. Specific planning attention is needed to determine their future viability and potential options for development.

In addition, the problems of crime and drugs will be reduced, and commercial and industrial centers will offer expanded job opportunities and retail services to residents of the ward and city. Ward 5 will increasingly be an attractive and secure place in which to live, work and raise a family c) Neighborhoods like Michigan Park, North Michigan Park, Woodridge, Lamond-Riggs, Brook]and, Queens Chapel, Arboretum, Fort Lincoln and Gateway have a strong sense of community and visual identity. Few major changes are envisaged here. These neighborhoods will be protected from excessive traffic, commuter parking, noise and litter and be buffered from the negative impacts of new commercial, industrial and other non-residential development. Places of historic significance, gateways, parks and open space, and special streets and places will be enhanced to provide a more attractive setting and quiet refuge from daily living d) Other neighborhoods like Brentwood, Ivy City, Trinidad, Eckington, Bloomingdale, Truxton Circle and Hanover Place will benefit from new and rehabilitated housing, increased retail and public services, and expanded employment opportunities. Major new commercial and industrial development will begin to provide the services and jobs long promised e) At the same time, these neighborhoods will be protected from air, water and soil pollution; excessive traffic; commuter parking; and 222 ENROLLED ORIGINAL other negative impacts from commercial and industrial development. People will increasingly take pride in their neighborhoods. wv(f) The Fort Torten Green Line Metrorail Station (lower level) will open in 1993, with the potential for new and much needed mixed commercial/residential uses in the area. Mixed commercial/residential development will also begin to occur at the l~hode Island Metrorail Station, where the Washington Metropolitan Area Transit Authority and the District of Columbia, in consultation with the Ward 5 community, will cooperate in the joint development of their combined properties. W~(g) Neighborhood retail shopping centers will also show renewed life. The 12th and Monroe Streets small business/retail center will thrive, providing residents of the neighborhood and Catholic University with expanded retail services. Similarly, a local center with a wide range of services will flourish in Ivy City. The Hechinger Mall II at Bladensburg and Benning Roads will be under development. It will house existing businesses in the neighborhood as well as new businesses that complement Hechinger Mall I. Also, the 25-acre McMillan Sand Filter Site will be developed with mixed uses (retail/office/housing/recreation/open space/historic uses h) After years of decline, the New York Avenue rail corridor will again be a thriving industrial and commercial center. New businesses, with jobs and services for community residents, will complement recently established business ventures such as the Federal Express complex, the 26-acre Capital Commerce Center and the 27-acre Capital City Business and Industrial Park that includes the Black Entertainment Television Company. These industrial and commercial centers will be carefully designed, in consultation with Ward 5 residents, to ensure that they are compatible in overall design and scale with the neighborhood. ’(i) The cityWs anti-drug efforts, including enforcement, treatment and prevention programs, will be instrumental in reducing the crime rate, particularly illicit drug trafficking and homicides. In addition, a number of community service and religious groups, in cooperation with the District, will offer comprehensive adult remedial education and vocational training programs and special rehabilitation facilities for under skilled former drug pushers, drug users and exoffenders j) Improvements in the availability of housing, retail services, employment, transportation, public services and community facilities will also have a significant impact on the problems of drug abuse and drug-related crimes in the ward as well as reducing the numbers of ward residents on public assistance k) These opportunities, along with the physical transformation of the ward, will convince many ward residents (young and old) that there are viable alternatives to teenage pregnancy, drug-culture entrepreneurship and other self and community-destroying activities. Ward 5 will continue to become an ideal environment in which to live. VISEC. 1200.500.3 WARD 5 PLANNING FOCUS VIThe focus of the Ward 5 Plan is to 1) Give priority to the protection, rehabilitation and improvement of neighborhoods through code enforcement and neighborhood preservation programs 2) Emphasize development and rehabilitation measures that contribute to an orderly process of neighborhood stabilization. 223 EHROLLED ORIGINAL 3) Encourage the creation of new job opportunities and the effective use of the inventory of commercial land 4) Capitalize on Metrorail station areas as focal points of commercial, retail and community services and activities 5) Give priority to the upgrading of existing public services and facilities 6) Suggest ways of using public investments in the location of new capital improvements to stimulate private renovation of existing residential, commercial and industrial properties 7) Discourage the extension of strip commercial areas by providing appropriate sites and height and design limits on commercial clusters 8) Encourage the development of new employment areas that are compatible in design with and buffer adjoining residential uses SEC. 1200.500.4 WARD 5 HISTOKY a) Settlement of Ward 5 occurred as early as 1688 in what is known today as Brookland. The area was largely open countryside, forest, meadows and farmland. The earliest roads for the ward were Lincoln, Old Bladensburg, Brentwood and Bunker ttill. During the late 19th century, Brookland and Bladensburg experienced rapid growth as trolley lines extended outward from Washington City (what is now Downtown Around the turn of the century, many colleges and universities were established i.e Catholic University of America; the Paulists; the Marists; and Holy Cross Fathers, to name a few b) Brooks Mansion was built around 1840 on 10th and Monroe streets and is one of the oldest buildings in the ward. It was situated on a 134 acre tract known as the Brooks estate, where in 1887 the land was sold for housing c) Another neighborhood, Ivy City, was developed around 1872 and thrived during this period, as it was a brick manufacturing center and contributed significantly to Washington’s construction boom d) Extensive growth occurred during the first decade of this century in the ward. Eckington and Brookland grew along l~hode Island Avenue, a major trolley line and commuter route between the District and Maryland. Other street car lines and newly built streets served other communities in the ward e) Ward 5 continued to grow between the two World Wars. Major industrial and commercial enterprises, along with religious institutions, developed during this period. Brentwood Village and P~iggs Park were also completed during this period f) Few large open tracts of developable land remained after World War II in the ward. Smaller scaled residential development occurred from the mid 1940s to late 1950s in the Lamond and Fort Totten areas g) Major industrial development took place in the ward in the 1950s along the B&amp;amp;O and Pennsylvania l~ailroad tracks, particularly along the New York Avenue corridor. During the 1960s growth slowed. More recently, retail businesses have suffered from the competition of nearby suburban shopping centers. Commerce has shifted away from Ivy City: industrial firms have sought to expand in cheaper outlying areas in the suburbs. 224 ENROLLED ORIGINAL h) The population of the ward increased from 1950 to 1970, from predominantly White to Black. From 1960 through the 1970s, the Black composition of the ward increased from 40 to 80 percent SEC. 1200.500.5 WA]%D 5 TODAY a) Ward 5 is in the northeast section of the District of Columbia. The ward’s general boundaries are Kennedy Street on the north; the District line (Eastern Avenue) on the east; the Anacostia River, Benning l%oad, Florida Avenue, and New York Avenue on the south; and New Jersey Avenue, Second Street, Michigan Avenue, Harewood Road and the Baltimore and Ohio l{ailroad right-of-way on the west b) Existing Land Use Patterns 1) Ward 5 is predominantly residential although it includes the District’s major industrial corridor. The ward’s neighborhoods are, for the most part, well-maintained with structurally sound housing. The neighborhoods include Lamond-l%iggs, MichiganPark, Queens Chapel, Brookland and Woodridge to the north; Fort Lincoln, Gateway and Arboretum to the east; Trinidad and Ivy City to the south; Truxton Circle, Bloomingdale, Eckington and Edgewood to the west; and Brentwood and Langdon in the central portion of the ward. The ward has the region’s only "new town" Fort Lincoln, a designated urban renewal area 2) The major industrial area is located in the New York Avenue corridor along the Pennsylvania Railroad tracks. New York Avenue and W Street remain the primary focus of efforts to expand and attract light industry in the District. As the District’s largest industrial corridor, New York Avenue is key to the city’s efforts to promote growth and employment opportunities in the technologies of the future 3) In the commercial areas, the Hechinger Mall, built in 1982, draws customers from all areas of the city and parts of nearby Maryland; the t{hode Island Avenue Shopping Center includes the first Ames (formerly Zayres) in the District; and the wholesale/retail food shops of the Capital City Market are thriving 4) There are several local and multi-neighborhood retail centers located throughout the ward. They are found along Rhode Island Avenue, along ]2th Street in the neighborhood of Brookland and on Michigan Avenue near the Eastern Avenue boundary in the Michigan Park neighborhood. There is a new convenience center on West Virginia Avenue in Ivy City 5) Many middle class neighborhoods including Brookland, Lamond-l%iggs, Woodridge and Michigan Park, remain stable and active. Some areas of the ward, however, require some measure of assistance to achieve comparable stability and vitality. Unemployment remains high in neighborhoods such as Ivy City, Trinidad, Carver and Montana Terraces, and Langston Dwellings. At the same time, the housing stock in these neighborhoods needs upgrading. Neigh.borhoods adjacent to industrial and commercial areas, such as Ivy City and Brentwood, are often affected by traffic, noise, dust and other side-effects of these uses 6) Ward 5 has several social service providers. They comprise the Woodridge Senior Wellness Center, the Washington Center for Aging Services, the Woodridge Neighborhood Health Center and similar out-patient clinical facilities. The providers range from intermediate to certified nursing complexes to walk-in neighborhood 225 ENROLLED ORIGINAL health, pediatric and dental clinics that serve the general public. The Aid to Families with Dependent Children (AFDC) and Food Stamp Program serve a small but not insignificant number of the ward’s citizens. In order to deal with the social ills of drug and criminal activity, neighborhoods are actively cooperating with the Metropolitan Police Department and other District of Columbia agencies. A number of community oriented programs have been established such as the Take Back Our Streets program c) Demographic Characteristics I) Population A) Ward 5 had a population of 75,100 in 1990. Its population decreased by 7,500 persons or 9 percent during the period of 1980-1990. During the same period, the citywide population decreased by 4 percent B) The racial composition of the ward remained constant from 1980 through 1990. During this period, Blacks and other races made up 90 percent of the ward’s population, while Whites made up 10 percent. This compared with 68 and 30 percent, respectively, citywide. The population aged 15-44 represented 47 percent of the ward residents in 1990, an increase of 1 percent, compared to 52 percent for the city, also a one percent increase between 1980 and 1990. The elderly (65 and over) and the young population (under 15) were about 13 and 16 percent, respectively, in 1990, compared with the citywide figures of 16 and 17 percent 2) Housing. The number of households in the ward remained substantially the same from 1980 to 1990. A household is equivalent to an occupied housing unit. The mean household size in the ward decreased from 2.7 in 1980 to 2.5 in 1990. In 1990 48 percent of the households were owner-occupied, compared with 47 percent in 1980. The city wide figures were 39 percent in 1990 and 35 percent in 1980 3) Income A) The median household income of Ward 5 residents in 1989 was approximately $26,900, compared with $30,700 citywide, a difference of 12 percent. According to 1980 census data, the median household income in 1979 for Ward 5 was $15,300, compared with $16,200 citywide. The ward’s figure was 6 percent below the median household income for the city B) Twenty percent of the households in the ward had incomes less than $10,0000 in 1990, compared with 17 percent citywide. In 1979, 34 percent of the households in the ward had incomes less than $10,000 compared with 30 percent of the city C) In 1979, 19 percent of the households (about 5,400 households) were below the poverty level. It decreased to 16 percent or 4,600 households in poverty in 1989. The Census Bureau defines the poverty level as a family of four with an annual income of $7,200 or less. The city’s households below the poverty level in both years were 17 and 15 percent for 1979 and 1989, respectively D) In 1990, 9 percent if the ward’s population received food stamps, and 8 percent received Aid to Families with Dependent Children (AFDC These figures are proximate to the citywide figures of 7 and 8 percent, respectively 4) Educational Status. In 1990, 65 percent of persons 25 years and over had completed high school and college compared to 73 226 ENROLLED ORIGINAL percent citywide. While over 26 percent graduated from high school, only 19 percent went on to graduate from college. Citywide, persons in these categories showed a 2 percent decrease between completion of high school and college. Statistics indicate that the ward lagged behind the city in completing college in 1990, 19 and 23 percent, respectivel But the ward kept pace with the city in that 20 and 19 percent, respectively, completed at least 1 to 3 years of college. Similarly, the ward had 26 percent and the city had 21 percent of its population completing 4 years of high school d) Current Development Activity t~(1) Capital Commerce Center (planned This project will cover some 26 acres in the Eckington Yards complex located north of l~lorida Avenue at Eckington Place, N.E.

The ward’s three Metrorail 230 ENROLLED ORIGINAL stations, l~hode Island Avenue, Brookland/CUA and Fort Torten, also provide major development opportunities, particularly for mixed commercial/residential development oriented to surrounding communities as well as to the city. Ward 5 citizens want more than just jobs and new businesses. They seek development that will enhance and expand existing businesses, create new ownership opportunities, increase retail services and opportunities for ward residents, and promote the vitality of ward neighborhoods b) The Ward 5 Plan addresses development issues affecting all levels of the ward’s economy. The plan calls for instituting new economic development entities, through joint public and private efforts, that can undertake specific projects in accordance with the city’s economic development priorities. The opportunity exists for new development to attract visitors, businesses and organizations from other parts of the countr and possibly abroad. It seeks meaningful citizen involvement through community development organizations, Advisory Neighborhood Commissions, colleges, universities and the private sector. Of significance is the need for services and programs that strengthen the occupational skills of the ward’s labor force, particularly persons with disabilities and/or who are unemployed. ’V(c) Many minority-owned and small businesses in the ward are suffering from the effects of new development or revitalization pressures along business corridors. Ward 5 could benefit from the establishment of business incubator facilities in selected areas, that are having difficulties competing in the market place, such facilities could assist merchants with lower rents and support services to offset marginal operations SEC. 1200. 502 WARD 5 OBJECTIVES FOK ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT "The objectives for economic development are 1) Enhance and expand the ward’s economic activity and employment centers, particularly in the underused industrial and commercial areas 2) Encourage and promote the Ward 5 Community Development Corporations (CDCs) and similar neighborhood-based economic development groups and to integrate these groups into the DistricCs overall planning for and implementation of economic development activities 3) Encourage and promote equity investment opportunities for Ward 5 residents and business persons in projects such as the Capital Commerce Center, development around Metro Stations, the McMillan site and in the New York Avenue corridor 4) Enhance commercial concentrations such as Hechinger Mall, 12th Street and the Fourth Street and Rhode Island Avenue Shopping Center in order to provide a broad range of goods and services to ward residents 5) Better identify community desired uses in commercial/industrial areas of the ward 6) Increase nonprofit child care facilities in new commercial and residential developments 7) Conduct an intensive study to determine the needs of small businesses in order to arrest their decline. 231 "SEC. 1200.503 WARD 5 ACTIONS IN SUPPORT OF ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT "The policies in support of economic development area as follows 1) l~romote economic development projects in the Eckington Yards and Ivy City industrial and commercial tracts A) An opportunity exists to locate flexible office and retail services in these areas. With careful planning and design, adverse impacts on abutting residential neighborhoods can be satisfactorily mitigated. Care must be taken in the development of the Crummel School property on Ga]]audet Street. The site is zoned industrial but abuts the Ivy City residential core B) Recommended actions i) Identify an appropriate mix of uses, scale and density limitations for development prelects ii Identify potential adverse impacts from development prelects on abutting neighborhoods iii) Develop urban design guidelines to buffer and screen the different incompatible uses in these areas iv) Work with the local community development corporations to help create the appropriate economic development climate and activity v) Coordinate efforts of the public and private sectors to spur economic development in the Eckington Yards and Ivy City commercial and industrial areas vi) Identify appropriate public programs that can facilitate economic development, including industrial revenue bonds, tax increment financing and tax abatement vii) Consider establishing an Ivy City/Trinidad economic development zone through the legislative process viii) Assess the potential impacts on existing transportation networks and promote the development of public transportation systems to all developed sites ix) Discourage the proliferation of junk yard type commercial activity in the Ivy City area since these activities do not enhance the quality of life in the adjoining residential areas 2) Complete a small area planning study for the New York Avenue industrial corridor to determine the appropriate mix, scale, density and design of development A) The New York Avenue corridor, bounded by North Capitol Street on the west and the District’s boundary on the east, has the potential for production and technical employment uses, flex office/space uses and limited general office uses. Design of new development should focus on the aesthetics of New York Avenue as a major gateway into the District. Without a prescribed land use and development plan, many available properties will be haphazardly improved. It is important that a blueprint be prepared to guide and direct preferred land uses B) Recommended actions i) Conduct a study and prepare a small area plan to determine the type and design of future industrial development in the corridor. 232 ENROLLED ORIGINAL ,l(ii) Conduct a market feasibility analysis to ascertain the cost and timing of potential development iii Identify physical improvements or site preparations which will accommodate future development iv) Assess the potential impacts on existing transportation networks and promote the development of public transportation systems to all developed sites v) Incorporate the entire New York Avenue Corridor as a "Special Treatment Area" or "Enterprise Zone 3) Capitalize on economic development opportunities along the North Capitol Street corridor A) The corridor is the focus of competing interests. The community needs to secure businesses which will provide a high quality and diverse mix of goods and services to the residents of adjacent neighborhoods in particular and the city wide community in general. There is a potential for the development of major retail and office facilities on currently available vacant land and buildings on the corridor and adjacent streets. The District of Columbia has completed a transportation impact study which includes this area B) Retail and service facilities in the area are woefully inadequate to respond to the needs and demands of the resident population and other potential patrons and clients. The Eastern sector, along North Capitol Street, Florida Avenue, N.E and First Street, N.E can readily accommodate major large tract development activity. Other sites adjacent to the area (i.e. McMillan Sand Filter Site) can be developed in conjunction with the North Capitol Street commercial area in order to provide a regional economic development activity. In addition, North Capitol Street, New York Avenue and ~’irst Street, N.E. are recognized by the Office of Planning as "Priority economic development 11areas C) Recommended actions i) Study and evaluate the impact of the current multi-use character (including residential and commercial) on the vitality of the economic revitalization and development of the North Capitol Street commercial corridor and immediate adjoining areas ii) Develop criteria for commercial upgrading iii) Promote appropriate commercial development, including centers for retail and office uses, to provide for continued growth and vitality, particularly along North Capitol Street and Florida Avenue, between First Street, N.W New York Avenue, and First Street, N.E iv) Upgrade/expand the infrastructure in designated neighborhoods and in other locations along the corridor. Specific areas are A) Streetscaping along North Capitol Street, to include 1) l~edesigning the median strip between Florida and New York avenues to include shrubbery, trees and lighting 2) Redesigning the intersection of North Capitol Street and Florida Avenue to include a) Potential of a "round about b) O Street--North East and North West c) Relocation of bus stops d) Relocation of cross walks e) Redesign of traffic pattern and ancillary access ways B) Sidewalk-scaping and resurfacing along North Capitol Street, between Florida and New York Avenues; P Street Northeast between North Capitol Street and Florida Avenues, Northeast; and Florida Avenue, between O Street Northwest, 233 ENROLLED ORIGINAL and New York Avenue, Northeast to include 1) l~esurface sidewalk with brick; 2) Install new curbs 3) Sidewalk scaping, including the redesign and placement of tree boxes, grating and terracing sidewalks, installing planters and lighting, planting trees and shrubbery, and adding trash receptacles v) Include the North Capitol Street area between New York and Florida avenues in the Neighborhood Development Assistance Program (NDAP vi) l~eview development projects proposed in the North Capitol Street/New York Avenue/Florida Avenue area in terms of the Urban l~enewal Plan for the Northeast Number One Area located nearby in Ward 6, D.C. Law 8-129 and the city’s development objectives 4) l~evitalize and expand existing neighborhood serving retail centers, where appropriate A) There are a number of neighborhood serving retail centers in the ward that are in need of revitalization to better serve nearby neighborhoods. Such centers are located at 12th Street, between Irving Street and l~hode Island Avenue; Michigan Avenue and Allison Street; 18th and Monroe streets; South Dakota Avenue and Decatur Street; l~iggs l~oad near Kennedy Street; 12th Street between Perry and Michigan; l~hode Island between 18th and 14th; and Mount Olivet ttoad and West Virginia Avenue N.E. Another location which has the potential to become a neighborhood service center is at Michigan Avenue and P~hode Island at 1st Street N.W however, a clear direction has not been given to facilitate the development of this area by the community or area merchants B) l~ecommended actions i) Complete an inventory of business establishments and recommend ways to improve marginal store operations. Emphasis should also be placed on the physical appearance of store frontages ii) Leverage funds to provide the city and community with business loans and financial aid to bring in preferred businesses which support these areas iii) Revitalize existing commercial areas to ensure that the ward’s neighborhoods have access to an adequate and suitable range of services iv) Investigate the feasibility of acquiring the D.C. Technical P~esearch and Development facility on 10th Street and Michigan Avenue together with the Community Development Corporation and the community for its possible use as a community business venture v) Target public policy mechanisms which provide incentives for entrepreneurial investment designed to provide essential services and create employment 5) Develop strategies to create additional community equity investment opportunities in economic development projects proposed for the ward A) Equity investment opportunities for ward residents and businesses may be included as part of development proposals where major public actions are required to make projects feasible and successful. This would be particularly apt at the McMillan Sand Filter site; the Hechinger Mall II site; the North Capitol Street corridor; Eckington Yards; along the New York Avenue Corridor and around the ward’s Metrorail station areas. Developers should commit and provide public 234 ENROLLED ORIGINAL benefits or amenities to a neighborhood in exchange for community support and public actions needed for the development project. wt (B) Recommended actions i) Identify, for a specific area, the types of investment activities that will benefit the community or increase employment opportunities for the ward residents w(ii) Revitalization actions should include significant measures and projects that create employment for youths, semi-skilled and skilled adults and senior citizens. w~(|ii) Review and evaluate development projects to determine if community equity investment opportunities are being or should be incorporated into development proposals iv) Promote and, where applicable, identify methods of business financing that will afford Ward 5 residents equity opportunities in economic development projects T(6) Encourage revitalized and expanded commercial centers along the Rhode Island Avenue corridor A) The corridor needs a larger and better balance of retail goods and services. Khode Island Avenue is a designated special street in the Comprehensive Plan and has the potential for upgrading to boulevard status. Plans for development along the avenue should provide for a mix of shops, restaurants, arts and entertainment centers, novelty stores, and boutiques as well as essential neighborhood oriented retail and services B) Recommended actions i) Study the feasibility of making the Rhode Island Avenue Metrorail Station a major mixed commercial/retail/housing center for the ward. ’(ii) Provide financial assistance to existing local merchants for commercial improvements, including facade improvements and new and expanded commercial operations iii) Assist in the establishment of new retail service areas to ensure that all neighborhoods have access to a convenient and wide range of services along the corridor. T iv) Use regulatory and capital improvement programs to enhance private improvements in existing and new community and neighborhood shopping areas v) Monitor areas where adverse effects (traffic, noise, safety, parking, litter) which result from commercial development are being experienced, and provide appropriate action to alleviate the problems 7) Promote upgraded and expanded commercial development in the Bladensburg ttoad/Benning P~oad commercial business center area A) This area has the potential to become a larger regional serving commercial center supporting nearby residential neighborhoods as well as attracting consumers from other District neighborhoods and suburban neighborhoods B l~ecommended actions i) Prepare a planing and zoning analysis report to make land use patterns and zoning consistent with the Comprehensive Plan. Provide traffic analyses, identifying redevelopment and revitalization opportunities to ensure future development is appropriate 235 in design, scale, uses, and accessibility and provides surrounding neighborhoods with a wide range of goods and services ii) Conduct a market analysis for the Bladensburg Road area to determine the feasibility for expanded retail uses, particularly for the Hechinger Mall II site and nearby businesses and other commercial properties, as a multi-neighborhood or regional-serving center. Jointly promote appropriate commercial development, in cooperation with the community iii) Work with the local and regional business firms and associations, chain retail stores and others to explore new business ventures in the area 8) Encourage an increase in the number of minority-owned and small businesses within the ward and assist existing businesses A) Many minority businesses are suffering from decreased patronage. They are also experiencing difficulty in attracting outlying, pass-through and/or new clientele. Stores and shops in Truxton Circle, Eckington Yards and Edgewood, as well as along portions of the New York Avenue and Rhode Island Avenue corridors, are experiencing particularly difficult business conditions B) Recommended actions i) Conduct a market study in these areas to determine the demand and feasibility of expanded and new business ventures in these neighborhoods and recommend appropriate public and private actions to assist minority entrepreneurs to fully participate in development opportunities ii) Survey minority business ownership to identify special problems facing them in the ward iii) Establish an incentive program to encourage small and minority entrepreneurs to establish, expand or diversify operations to meet business and consumer needs of the ward or market area iv) Assist small and minority businesses to obtain certification which will enable them to pursue contracting opportunities in the Sheltered Market program established under D.C. Law 1-95 v) Establish a Business Incubator System designed to provide constant technical support to new and small businesses SEC. 1200.504 WARD 5 HOUSING a) In 1985, the ward had about 30,900 housing units, representing 11 percent of the city’s total housing stock. The predominant housing types are single-family units and multi-family units of five or more apartments. Ward 5 contains the third highest percentage of owner-occupied homes in the city, 47 percent b) There are several neighborhoods that suffer from deteriorated housing stock, including a number of public, assisted and other housing complexes. They include Ivy City, Carver Terrace, the Bates Street and Truxton Circle areas, Montana Terrace and Hanover Place. Much of the deterioration is due to neglect and dwindling financial resources for repairs c) Housing for the elderly and persons with disabilities is a key issue facing the ward. The Fort Lincoln New Town development has provided significant new housing opportunities, including housing for the elderly as well as affordable housing for low- and moderate-income 236 ENROLLED ORIGINAL households. An opportunity also exists to provide additional housing for the elderly through the use of appropriate single room occupancy (sEe) housing development. While increasing housing opportunities for special groups like the elderly and disabled, the ward and city must ensure that community-based residential facilities are well managed and integrated into the ward’s neighborhoods but are not overly concentrated in any given neighborhood d) Another housing-related concern is the compliance of universities and colleges in the ward with campus master plans and zoning that ensure compatibility of future development with adjacent residential communities. There has been increased concern about the potential adverse effects caused by inappropriate campus development. Such effects include personal safety, neighborhood parking, noise and litter, and loss of the sense of community e) In-fill housing and housing rehabilitation are a pressing concern in Ivy City, Trinidad, Hanover Place, Bloomingdale, Brentwood and Eckington. Additionally, market pressures have not made available enough affordable housing units in these communities. Public housing units in Montana Terrace, Edgewood Terrace and other housing in developments such as Carver Terrace also suffer from lack of rehabilitation measures SEC. 1200.505 WARD 5 OBJECTIVES FOR HOUSING "The objectives for housing are 1) Protect and preserve the wardts stable neighborhoods and its sound housing stock 2) Stimulate the production of new housing, such as in Fort Lincoln, and rehabilitate and improve housing in areas such as Ivy City to meet the needs of all the ward’s residents, including the elderly and persons with disabilities 3) Provide incentives for housing at desired locations such as the Fort Torten Metrorail Station Special Treatment Area and the Rhode Island Avenue Metrorail area 4) Improve the cityls low rent housing program--especially through improved maintenance efforts--and to encourage homeownership 5) Reduce the overall cost of housing for low- and moderate-income Ward 5 residents 6) Appropriately address the issues and concerns associated with nonresidential uses in residential zones SEC. 1200.506 WARD 5 ACTIONS IN SUPPORT Ot~ HOUSING "The policies in support of housing are as follows 1) Encourage new and rehabilitated affordable housing for area residents A) While much of the wardls housing stock is sound and well maintained, opportunities to acquire this housing at affordable prices are few. Housing Opportunity Areas designated in the Comprehensive Plan should provide expanded opportunities for the production of affordable housing and its rental or purchase by low and moderate income families and persons B) The following areas are designated as Housing Opportunity Areas in the Comprehensive Plan: 237 ENROLLED ORIGINAL i) The Fort Lincoln New Town, bounded by Bladensburg Road on the north, Eastern Avenue on the east, New York Avenue on the south and South Dakota Avenue on the west ii) The Fort Torten Metrorail Station area, bounded by the B&amp;amp;O Railroad to the west, Riggs Road to the north, South Dakota Avenue to the east and Buchanan Street to the south C) Recommended actions i) Monitor housing development for the Fort Torten and Fort Lincoln Housing Opportunity Areas ii) Monitor housing production goals identified under the updated urban renewal plan for Fort Lincoln New Town iii Identify additional potential housing opportunities areas iv) Provide expanded assistance programs to help low and moderate income families and individuals acquire affordable housing 2) Reincorporate useable vacant and boarded-up dwelling units into the ward’s housing stock A) Particular attention should be directed to areas in the Hanover, Ivy City, Trinidad and Eckington neighborhoods. A few units, previously under the Department of Housing and Community Developments’ Homestead Program, have been renovated and are now occupied in these communities. Acquisition of these properties has been slow and tedious. Additional properties exist in the ward and should be identified. Absentee owners of vacant property must participate in making these structures available for occupancy, in the near term B) Recommended actions i) Identify and compile an inventory of vacant and boarded-up housing units and develop strategies to return the units to the housing stock ii) Increase public awareness of housing programs that provide funding to restore/rehabilitate properties in the targeted areas iii) Create a loan pool, including Community Development Block Grant funds and private lending institution funds, available to home owners, non-profit organizations and landlords for the rehabilitation of vacant and boarded-up units 3) Provide affordable new or rehabilitated housing for low- and moderate-income residents A) Housing providers, both public and private, need to increase the public’s awareness of available low- and moderate-income housing set-aside programs. Attention should be targeted in Ivy City and Hanover Place as housing development and renovation projects get underway B) Recommended actions i) Evaluate development proposals to ensure that a suitable amount of affordable housing units are offered ii) Compile an inventory of housing units suitable for rehabilitation and take appropriate steps to acquire financing to restore the units to the housing stock iii) Review and recommend suitable financing and tax incentives and other regulatory means to stimulate the production and rehabilitation of low- and moderate-income housing. 238 ENROLLED ORIGINAL 4) Rehabilitate and maintain public and assisted and other housing units at Montana Terrace, Edgewood Terrace, Carver Terrace, Langston Terrace and Western Mews A) Many of these units are in need of substantial repair, rehabilitation and replacement, due to inadequate funding and changing priorities for work to be scheduled B) Recommended actions i) Continue evaluating public, subsidized and other housing units for necessary rehabilitation and maintenance. w~(ii) Obtain expanded capital funding necessary to maintain and restore these properties iii) Coordinate city efforts addressing drug and crime problems with public and assisted housing residents iv) Provide increased funding to rehabilitate potential residential properties through the planned unit development (PUD) process public benefits package of the Zoning Regulations, in return for new commercial development, in Downtown and other areas of the ward attractive to commercial development v) Determine alternative courses of action for Public Housing units, such as Langston Terrace, including rehabilitation for home ownership 5) Provide a wider range of housing opportunities and services to the elderly and special populations A) The senior citizen population has increased in the ward but not at the same rate as housing designed to meet the needs of that population. The production of housing for elderly individuals and others should be a major priority of the District government. The city and private housing providers should produce units which are affordable and accessible to the elderly and to persons with disabilities B) l~ecommended actions i) Identify ways to produce additional housing for the elderly through various programs and outreach activities. Regulatory changes, Community Development Block Grants and other methods should be explored ii) Consider the reuse of unused and surplus publicly owned properties for senior citizen housing and service centers SEC. 1200.507 WARD 5 ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION r,(a) The Environmental Protection section of the ward plan encompasses the protection of the natural environment and the regulation of the human environment in ways that protect, preserve, maintain and elevate the total human environment and the well-being of ward residents, workers and visitors b) Areas of environmental concern to Ward 5 residents include soil erosion; street and sidewalk cleaning and maintenance; air and noise quality; vibrations from heavy trucks and construction activities especially in areas adjacent to residential neighborhoods; and the lack of trees or tree maintenance in certain sections of the ward c) A challenge facing the ward and city is to continue efforts to increase the development of the significant amount of industrial land in Ward 5, while controlling side-effects that could cause environmental hazards. Heavy truck traffic, noise, excessive air pollution and 239 ENROLLED ORIGINAL vibrations in residential neighborhoods are frequent by-products of industrial land use d) These issues, among others, are most noticeable in the Eighth and 10th streets areas of the Brookland neighborhood, the New York Avenue corridor parallel to the B&amp;amp;O railroad right-of-way, the Fort Torten Metro Station area and the Eckington and Brentwood neighborhoods. These areas, therefore, must be constantly monitored to maintain and improve the quality of the ward’s environment for present and future generations e) The city and ward must also ensure that its concern to increase economic development does not compromise the equal concern to enhance and improve the total environment of the ward. There is also a need to increase the supply of natural open space in areas where there is a serious parkland deficit SEC. 1200.508 WARD 5 OBJECTIVES FOR ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION "The objectives for environmental protection are 1) Protect the natural environment and regulate the built environment in ways that maintain and enhance the quality of life and the sense of well-being of residents 2) Address soil erosion and water/sewer problems and prohibit illegal dumping in Ward 5 3) Improve street, sidewalk and yard cleaning and maintenance through improving and maintaining public awareness of home and business ownership responsibilities 4) Monitor and resolve problems of air pollution, noise and vibrations caused by vehicular traffic, construction activities and industrial uses especially in areas adjacent to residential neighborhoods 5) Plant and maintain street trees in sections of the ward, where needed 6) Ensure adequate protection of the public health and safety by testing for and removing lead, radon gas, asbestos and other hazardous substances from the manmade environment SEC. 1200. 509 WARD 5 ACTIONS IN SUPPORT OF ENVII~ONMENTAL PROTECTION "The policies in support of environmental protection are as follows 1) Plant, maintain or replace trees and shrubbery where needed in the ward, and prevent soil erosions which produce unstable environmental conditions A) Where the soil has a predominant character of clay composition, such as in the Carver Terrace neighborhood, water absorption is very slow and produces mud streams. These soils are not fertile and plant life, such as trees and other greenery, is difficult to maintain and does not flourish, since much of the top silt layer has washed away due to the slope and soil instability of the area B) }recommended actions i) Conduct a survey, in coordination with the community, to determine where there are soil erosion problems, and encourage property owners and tenants to take corrective action ii) Provide improved street tree replacement and maintenance in the unit block of O Street N.W West Virginia Avenue 240 ENROLLED ORIGINAL N.E Florida Avenue N.W./N.E and other specific locations inventoried and identified by the Department of Public Works and the Advisory Neighborhood Commissions as requiring such service iii) Survey public space areas with poor landscaping to determine the need for additional planting and upgrade those areas with the greatest deficiencies iv) Promote and encourage private planting and maintenance of public spaces within the ward by citizens of the ward 2) Complete a study of alternative route alignments to construct a storm water relief sewer in Ivy City to control flooding that has disrupted the environmental stability of the neighborhood A) In the vicinity of Mr. Olivet Road and West Virginia Avenue, flooding has caused delays in construction and damage or loss to a number of housing units at Western Mews on Capitol Avenue. About 5 acres in this area is prone to flooding and has hindered neighborhood revitalization activities and business ventures. The existing amount of impervious surfaces and soil conditions in the area increase potential and actual flood damage from heavy rains B) Recommended actions i) Work with the community organizations to inform residents of the alternative locations of the proposed relief sewer ii) Provide funds in the Capital Improvements Program to construct the storm water relief sewer along the alignment determined and recommended by the storm water relief sewer study 3) Protect residential communities, including Brentwood, Eckington, North Michigan Park, Michigan Park and Lamond Riggs from the potential adverse impacts resulting from the construction of new commercial and industrial projects A) Development occurring in the New York Avenue corridor is impacting the neighborhood with truck traffic, dust and debris from construction activities. New York and Rhode Island avenues are the main roads used to truck supplies and materials to construction sites. Vibrations from these trucks is experienced on abutting residential streets. Negative environmental impacts can last 18 months or longer, depending on the length of time it takes to complete a development project B) Recommended actions i) Monitor new development projects to ensure adequate buffering between the construction site and adjacent residential communities ii) t~evise, as necessary, and enforce applicable construction, trucking and environmental review regulations to reduce potential adverse impacts such as noise, air quality, dust, and inappropriate use of the city’s water/sewer system resulting from construction activities iii) Required Environmental Impact Statements are to be prepared and distributed, in a simplified, understandable form, to appropriate ANCs and to all property owners within 500 feet of the proposed development prior to approval of the development plans 4) Improve the environmental quality of the ward’s commercial and residential neighborhoods by promoting self-help clean-up programs, prompt trash removal, appropriate disposal of abandoned automobiles, and litter removal in ward parks. 241 ENROLLED ORIGINAL A) Numerous sites throughout the ward show signs of environmental neglect. The concerns include trash removal, green space enhancement, discarded vehicles and neighborhood visual appearance B) Recommended actions i) Encourage Advisory Neighborhood Commissions to develop and announce neighborhood clean-up campaigns in conjunction with special city trash removal schedules ii) Increase private and public trash pick-ups in commercial and residential areas along North Capitol Street and Hanover Place, N.W iii) Improve the maintenance of Ward 5’s green spaces, including Brentwood Park on Mr. Olivet Road, N.E iv) Work with ward residents to identify abandoned automobiles, especially in the Ivy City and Edgewood neighborhoods v) Enhance and expand the Parking Enforcement Program to improve pedestrian safety and parking conditions and to enhance the visual environment in neighborhood commercial areas, particularly on Brentwood Road between W Street and Rhode Island Avenue, N.E vi) Encourage community groups, businesses and others in the ward to adopt parks and playgrounds under the District’s Adopt-A-Park/Adopt-A-Playground program and encourage thorough and systematic publicity of the program through signage, advertisements, etc vii) Promote the development and maintenance, in conjunction with the National Park Service, of recreational facilities within the ward’s existing green spaces viii) l~equire all compostable materials, such as grass clippings and leaves, to be separated from household and other forms of trash for collection and composting. Residents should be properly notified of collection schedules and of areas within the ward where eompostable materials can be dumped ix) Inform residents of the dangers of household hazardous wastes such as motor oil, paints, detergents, and cleansers, and establish collection areas and schedules, convenient to all residents, for disposal of these wastes x) Require all businesses that distribute or sell hazardous wastes such as auto parts stores, gas stations, etc to establish collection facilities in conformance with environmental standards SEC. 1200.510 WAF~D 5 TRANSPORTATION a) Transportation issues in Ward 5 center around the impact of traffic from industrial areas on surrounding residential neighborhoods; appropriate access to Metrorai] stations; upgrading and improving streets and roadways; and providing off- street parking for commercial establishments b) The transportation system in Ward 5 is prompt and convenient for neighborhood residents. It encompasses major and minor arterial streets, distributor and collector neighborhood streets, bike trails and the Metrobus and Metrorail systems of the Washington Metropolitan Area Transit Authority (WMATA c) Public transportation in the Ward, consists of the Metrobus network with approximately 45 routes and the Metrorail system with three stations on two routes the Red Line and (soon) the Green Line. The 242 ENROLLED ORIGINAL Metrorail stations are located at Rhode Island Avenue, Brookland and Fort Torten (a future transfer station to the Green Line To enhance this system, efforts are being made by WMATA, the Department of Public Works (DPW) and other entities to improve bus and automobile access and to address the special transportation needs of special groups, including the elderly and persons with physical impairments. DPW’s program to cut curbs throughout the city will also improve access for the disabled d) Bicycling, a leisure and recreational activity for some, is also becoming an important mode of transportation. The D.C. Bicycle Advisory Council (BAC) and DPW have made progress in updating a D.C. Transportation Bicycle Plan. The effort promotes bicycling as another link in the city’s overall transportation system e) Parking around the ward’s colleges and universities, Metrorail stations, churches and business centers continues to be a major concern. The use of neighborhood streets by commuters, shoppers and employees of nearby retail centers impacts the safety and quality of life of residents. Churches that do not have adequate on-site parking for their members often create parking problems and congestion on and near the residential streets on which they are located. Although the ward has experienced a great deal of positive development, the problems associated with the construction of new projects creates problems that must be addressed. Noise, congestion, air pollution and safety are often undesirable side-effects of development SEC. 1200.511 WARD 5 OBJECTIVES FOR TRANSPORTATION "The objectives of Transportation are 1) Increase the use of mass transit while minimizing problems associated with parking around Metrorail stations and commercial areas 2) Reduce nonresidential traffic in neighborhoods adjacent to heavily-used commercial and/or industrial corridors, and in the vicinity of ward Metrorail stations 3) Accelerate the upgrading of sections of major streets such as North Capitol Street, Florida Avenue, Bladensburg Road and New York and Rhode Island avenues 4) Use the transportation system to support economic development 5) Improve the pedestrian environment on major streets and roadways 6) Promote alternatives to private passenger vehicles such as Metrorail, Metrobus, bicycling along bike routes and walking along pedestrian paths 7) Modify existing zoning through increasing off-street parking requirements for uses such as churches, community retail centers, and other uses of these types SEC. 1200. 512 WARD 5 ACTIONS IN SUPPORT OF TRANSPORTATION "The policies in support of transportation are as follows 1) Improve the movement and management of vehicular and pedestrian traffic to ensure public safety and mitigate adverse effects of traffic and parking on residential streets around the Fort Torten, Brookland/CUA and Rhode Island Avenue Metrorail stations. 243 ENROLLED ORIGINAL 11{A) Development within l~letrorail Station areas can be expected to generate more traffic congestion and contribute to an increase in through-traffic onto residential streets. This occurs frequently on South Dakota Avenue and on Gallatin and Galloway streets as a result of the construction of the Green Line Metrorail route in the ward. The community has consistently voiced its concerns about this in the neighborhoods that surround the Fort Torten Metrorail station. I B) Recommended actions i) All proposed projects should include an analysis of potential traffic impacts on the surrounding streets and especially on adjacent residential neighborhoods ii) Resolve traffic and pedestrian circulation problems associated with construction activity around the Metrorail stations iii Provide off- street parking for Metro construction vehicles at appropriate sites at Metrorail stations where development is underway iv) Identify traffic control and mitigation measures to improve the safe flow of traffic around Metrorail construction sites v) Increase enforcement of regulations dealing with vehicles illegally parked or blocking streets adjacent to the ward’s Metrorail stations vi) Investigate parking and traffic congestion on McCormick Road and install, if necessary, a traffic signal at the intersection of Michigan Avenue 2) Improve and better maintain the ward’s streets, alleys and roadways, including curbs, gutters and sidewalks I(A) The District program to improve existing public streets, alleys and bridges should be improved and expanded. It installs curb ramps to make pedestrian-ways accessible to persons in wheelchairs and repairs or replaces gutters and sidewalks where necessary. Progress in carrying out this program lags considerably behind the demonstrated need in the ward B) Recommended actions i) Inventory streets, alleys and public spaces that need repair and provide specific application procedures by which the public can notify responsible agencies ii) Increase capital improvement funding for the repair, reconstruction, resurface and redesign of streets, alleys and roadways, including streets in critical need of repairs such as Taylor Street, Sixth, Girard and Franklin streets and parts of Rhode Island Avenue. 1~(iii) Study the need to resurface the alleyways on both sides of the 2700 block and behind the 2800 block of Fourth Street 3) Study other ways to improve traffic movement on ward streets and to provide for the safe and convenient movement of pedestrians across ward streets, particularly ward arterial streets A) A number of ward street intersections suffer from excessive congestion that contributes to unsafe pedestrian crossings. Neighborhood intersections, such as at Fourth and Franklin streets, need to be studied. In many instances, the length of the existing walk cycle on traffic lights does not allow enough time for the safe crossing of streets, especially by seniors or others with disabilities. 244 ENROLLED ORIGINAL B) Recommended actions i) Study and modify, as appropriate and necessary, the timing of signalized traffic intersections for safer pedestrian and vehicular movement. Investigate adjusting the traffic lights at Fourth and Franklin streets ii) Continue to construct public improvements, such as curb inclines aimed at increasing pedestrian mobility, particularly for the elderly and the handicapped iii) Study the need for traffic light signalization of Eastern Avenue and Monroe Street iv) Study the need to implement appropriate vehicular controls at Thirteenth and Brentwood Road 4) Control traffic congestion and parking problems caused by nonresidential uses in residential neighborhoods A) Churches, day care centers and professional offices related to institutional uses often create problems on neighborhood residential streets. Residents complain about non-residents parking in front of their homes, double parking, and unusually high unintended levels of congestion, on occasion, on neighborhood streets B) Recommended actions i) Work with church establishments to determine alternatives for off-street parking, such as shared parking facilities at shopping centers or other neighborhood parking lots ii) Determine if nonresidential uses in residential neighborhoods are contributing to traffic, parking and safety concerns on neighborhood residential streets iii Increase enforcement and inspection of nonresidential uses in residential zones to ensure compliance with the existing regulations 5) To assess the circulation layout of vehicular access to neighborhood commercial and warehouse centers to mitigate adverse effects of traffic, noise and pollution, especially along Nest Virginia Avenue, W Street and Eighth Street A) The community has worked with the Office of Business and Economic Development and Department of Public Works in the past to resolve traffic problems along W Street. Apparently the limited capacity of these roads, coupled with an average daily volume of 12,000 vehicles using West Virginia Avenue, has significantly reduced the level of traffic service on the avenue and to merchants and shoppers there B) l~ecommended actions i) Continue to work with the community at these locations to eliminate heavy truck traffic on residential streets ii) Work with area businesses and industrial firms, using the Business l~elocation Program, to relocate operations to more suitable sites within the New York Avenue industrial corridor such as the Capital City Business and Industrial Park. Relocating businesses would be those for which major expansions of current operations cannot satisfactorily occur because of space limitations or the likelihood of creating serious traffic problems in nearby residential neighborhoods iii) Monitor commercial areas where signs of adverse effects from traffic, noise, safety hazards, parking, and litter 245 ENROLLED ORIGINAL are being experienced by the community, and provide appropriate regulatory or other action necessary to alleviate the problems iv) Develop alternate through routes, in conjunction with ward residents, through imposing and enforcing weight and length limitations for heavy truck traffic passing through residential neighborhoods such as the existing Taylor Street route 6) To assess and diminish the adverse effect of the heavy truck traffic, noise, vibration and pollution on the residential community along the Taylor Street corridor from South Dakota Avenue to 7th Street A) The community has worked with the Department of Public Works (DPW) and other government officials in an attempt to alleviate the problems referenced above. The Department of Public Works has initiated discussions with the National Park Service to explore the possibility of acquiring park land on the east and west sides of the CSX railroad tracks for designated heavy truck usage. The National Park Service suggests that appropriate agencies and staff continue to work with the Fort Torten community and the industrial users of the road system for a solution to the heavy truck traffic. The National Park Service suggests that correction of discontinuous, obstructed, or unbuilt segments of both Puerto Rico Avenue and John McCormick Place be addressed as alternatives to any proposed use of parkland for industrial or access purposes B) Recommended actions i) Continue to work with the community to eliminate heavy truck traffic along this corridor ii) Developing an alternative route for the heavy truck traffic and working with the companies for acceptance of this route for their trucks. Also posting "No Thru Truck" signs on Taylor Street iii) Monitor commercial areas where adverse effects from truck traffic, noise and pollution are being experienced by the nearby residents, and provide regulatory action to alleviate these problems SEC. 1200.513 WARD 5 PUBLIC FACILITIES a) The public facilities goal of the District government is to provide adequate public facilities to support the cost-effective delivery of municipal programs and services and to support economic development and neighborhood improvement objectives. Public facilities throughout Ward 5 provide essential services to all members of the community. These facilities include schools, parks and recreation centers, libraries, fire and police stations, community service centers and general public works such as streets, sewers and water lines b) The District government agencies that are primarily responsible for carrying out the policies related to public facilities are the departments of Public Works, Human Services, Housing and Community Development, Public and Assisted Housing, Administrative Services and Recreation and Parks and the Board of Education. In addition, the D.C. Fire and Police departments, D.C. Public Schools and D.C. Library provide community services c) The D.C. Fire Department has four engine companies and an ambulance unit in the ward. The Fifth District Police Headquarters is also located in the ward and uses community-based programs to deter 246 ENROLLED ORIGINAL criminal and drug activities. Three libraries serve the ward: the Woodridge Kegional Library, Lamond-R|ggs Branch Library and Langston Community Library. A full service library is proposed for the McMillan Sand Filter site d) The ward has 16 recreation centers, 36 tennis courts, 6 swimming pools and neighborhood-based service centers interspersed throughout for use and enjoyment by all age groups of ward residents and others e) To educate ward youth, there are 15 elementary, 5 junior and 4 senior high schools, as well as career development centers, system-wide schools and special learning facilities f) The District emphasizes improving, upgrading and maintaining its infrastructure (i.e water and sewer mains, roadways and bridges, and building facilities Most of it was built from 50 to 100 years ago. Many public buildings have suffered from deferred maintenance. In the 1990s, the District will focus the city’s Capital Improvements Program on improving maintenance, public facility improvements and modernization. The degree to which this can be quickly accomplished is constrained by the city’s current limited fiscal resources SEC. 1200.514 WAKD 5 OBJECTIVES FOIt PUBLIC FACILITIES "The objectives for public facilities are 1) Provide for adequate delivery of municipal programs and services 2) Ensure the construction, rehabilitation and maintenance of facilities essential for public service delivery to all citizens 3) Provide adequate planning for public facilities such as public schools, recreation centers, police substations and libraries 4) Locate public facilities to provide optimum service and to support the land use, transportation, economic and social development, and neighborhood improvement objectives SEC. 1200.515 WARD 5 ACTIONS IN SUPPORT OF PUBLIC FACILITIES "The policies in support of public facilities are as follows i) Expand, up grade, landscape and, or renovate the recreation centers in the Edgewood and Eckington communities A) The community, in conjunction with the Advisory Neighborhood Commission, has asked the District to renovate these centers. Other centers are being identified by ward residents which are needed to operate various programs for the welfare of the ward residents B) Kecommended actions i) Evaluate use changes of existing recreational facilities to target improvements and provide landscaping through the regular budget cycle and the Capital Improvements Program ii) Continue to maintain and upgrade athletic fields, playground equipment and recreational green space, where necessary iii) Investigate additional funding sources for near-term improvements to include some cosmetic landscaping activity for area centers; and apply for future (long-term) capital improvement expenditures for renovation and, or expansion of the centers. 247 ENROLLEO ORIGINAL 2) To renovate and expand the uses of the Crispus Attucks Museum and Park of the Arts (CAMPA) facility and expand its use as a community service, with the possibility of becoming a site for a new police boys and girls club A) CAMPA is located in the Crispus Attucks Court at l~irst and V streets, N.W. It is one of few recreational facilities that is situated in the interior of an entire residential square. As a result, it provides a superior safety feature for neighborhood children playing there B) Recommended actions i) Explore, in cooperation with the community, obtaining capital funding to upgrade the facility,including landscaping at the facility ii) Investigate expanding neighborhood-serving programs at CAMPA 3) Study potential reuse of unused public and private facilities for use as neighborhood community service centers to be used by the community for civic, educational, social, and other services, including after school programs, especially in Ivy City, Truxton Circle, Eckington and Bloomingdale communities, but in all communities as well A) Residents of these communities have searched and found a number of sites that have reuse potential for neighborhood based community centers. They have not had any significant success in acquiring properties from the public and/or private sector. The sites may require city and private sector funding or other measures to make them habitable and productive B) Recommended actions i) Discuss with the D.C. Public Schools possible use of the old Emery School on Lincoln Road N.E by the community for civic, educational, social or other activities ii) Plan for the development of new public facilities and rehabilitate the existing facilities to accommodate special groups including the elderly, youth and the physically impaired iii) Expand the Roving Leader Program to additional public facilities in the Ivy City, Edgewood, Trinidad and other communities, including those not currently used but which are usable. The order in which the communities will be assisted will directly correlate to the amount of crime in that particular community iv) Identify and allocate funds for the acquisition of the old vacant carriage house at Third and Randolph streets. This facility is an excellent location for extensive youth development v) Study the potential for providing playground facilities for small and pre-school children at the Crummell School in Ivy City and elsewhere in the neighborhood 4) Reassess the use of underused public and private facilities and provide physical improvements for expanded and better joint-uses by non-profit organizations, local development corporations and others A) The community has long identified a need and desire to upgrade local facilities in order to provide needed social and educational programs or services in their immediate neighborhoods. Some of these local organizations have expressed an interest to operate in the facilities and continue providing service in the area. 248 ENROLLED ORIGINAL ~’(B) Recommended actions: ’I(i) Investigate the reuse of the old Emery School on Lincoln Road by both public and/or private groups for joint use activities. t1(ii) Encourage private non-profit organizations and local businesses to work with the District to improve the site 5) Reassess publicly used facilities for the use of civic and other community organizations. These facilities could house conference meetings and other community gatherings. ’I(A) It is necessary to work closely with the local schools. Cooperative efforts to allow organizations to use the facilities. Prior usage plans have facilitated their objective. W(B) Recommended action: Investigate the possible use of public schools and private facilities, including Catholic University of America and other universities and colleges in the community for no charge 6) Establish a full complement of police personnel in the Fifth District and a full complement of police vehicles and other equipment in the Fifth District A) The Fifth District Metropolitan Police Headquarters is presently understaffed and there is an insufficient number of police vehicles. Many of the police vehicles are currently in the repair shop and are serving no purpose to the community. The Fifth District is known to have one of the highest rate of crime. It is imperative that the police are awarded a sufficient amount of vehicles as well as officers in order to fully protect out community. Not only does this lack of resources effect the public, but it also terribly decreases the level of safety for the officers themselves. Todayls criminals have the state-of-the-art gunnery and our officers need the same gunnery. The police force needs to match or better the sophistication of the criminals weaponry. We need to establish a feeling of safety in our society B) Recommended actions i) l~esearch both public and private sources for possible funding for the purchasing of additional police resources ii) Allocate a portion of the budget to support manpower facilities for the Fifth District iii) Establish a plan to increase manpower over the same time table in which crime escalates 7) Expand the use of the Police Empowerment Plan A) There is a great need for better services and relations. This program has indicated successful results in different communities around the country. This Plan should be expanded. Police officers not only provide immediate safety, but they also provide visual aid to other immediate public needs such as sewer, electrical, telephone problems, etc B) Recommended action: Begin sensitivity training for better relations between officers and the public 8) Develop a drug and crime-free zone around all public schools to insure safety for the youths in the community, and to reduce the problems of drug abuse and crime in all Ward 5 communities. Where possible, re-zone sites that have a potential adverse effect on schools such as small stores and other misused type businesses. 249 ENROLLED ORIGINAL A) In some communities, sites are within or adjacent to neighborhood based schools and community centers that breed potential problems of drug abuse and crime. These sites will require the city to re-zone to reduce the possibility of drug abuse and crime B) Recommended actions i) Discuss with the D.C. Public Schools and the Zoning Commission and study the possibility of re-zoning or re-use of certain sites in the community that lend themselves to drug abuse and crime ii) Schools should develop drug and crime-free zones around the school areas. Distribute information to the community, Police, and neighborhood watch groups regarding the drug and crime free zones 9) Strategically place sub- stations through Ward 5 and coordinate efforts with private developers and other businesses A) With a better utilization of the police force in the area, we can lessen the crime rate B) Recommended actions i) Investigate locations and establish good relations with the private sector who will in turn donate the land which will be used for the placement of the sub-stations ii) Establish relationship between the Police Department and the private sector iii) Expand the use of the Auxiliary Police officers in conjunction with the business sector and provide better utilization of the Fifth District Citizens Advisory Council iv) Involve the youth in some way to ascertain better relations 10) Reassess the library facilities in Ward 5 to assure that the equipment is state-of-the-art, and emphasize Afro-centric education A) A movement in the community is necessary to assure the schools in Ward 5 are sufficiently exposed to an Afro-centric education, and approach to learning. It is also imperative that the school libraries are properly stocked with Afro-centric materials, and that the equipment is state-of-the-art as well B) Recommended actions i) Re search currently available re sources in comparison to other communities ii) Research Afro-centric materials and provide a broad understanding of the literature available in the area SEC. 1200.516 WARD 5 URBAN DESIGN a) The Urban Design Element focuses on shaping the pattern of development and protecting and enhancing existing physical features of the ward, both natural and manmade. Ward 5 is predominantly residential but includes major industrial, commercial and institutional uses. Many of these uses possess significant urban design characteristics b) The New York Avenue corridor, for example, serves as one of the major gateways into the city from the Baltimore/Washington Parkway. It provides an opportunity to enhance this important entrance way into the city. In close proximity to this gateway is one of the District’s major visitor attractions, the National Arboretum, a beautiful park-like research center of the U.S. Department of Agriculture, 250 ENROLLED ORIGINAL consisting of about 444 acres of floral, arboreal and shrub arrangements. The National Shrine of the Immaculate Conception, located in the Brookland/CUA area, also attracts many tourists each year. The Franciscan Monastery and Catholic University of America also reinforce the historic and visual image of the ward and city c) Most of the issues related to urban design in the ward focus on factors or conditions that afflict neighborhoods. These include commercial and/or industrial uses generating or having negative impacts on adjacent residential communities. Generally, they are not properly buffered or screened. The lack of basic amenities in certain areas of the ward (i.e sidewalks, street lights, and trees along with rutted streets, and blighted housing, constitute major visual as well as physical problems in a number of ward neighborhoods including Ivy City, Trinidad and Eckington SEC. 1200.517 WAItD 5 OBJECTIVES FOR URBAN DESIGN "The objectives for urban design are 1) Promote a physical environment that upgrades the ward’s aesthetic qualities, enhances neighborhood stability, emphasizes neighborhood identity and function, and physically enhances the gateways and entrance ways into the city 2) Give special design attention to those areas within the ward that have a poor physical image, where new development can improve the neighborhood’s visual qualities while providing needed services 3) Ensure that both existing and new industrial development in the ward is designed to be made compatible with nearby residential neighborhoods including necessary landscaping and buffering 4) Strengthen the design and visual character of commercial nodes and corridors that serve ward neighborhoods 5) Through the design of new structures, decrease the potential for illegal activity by eliminating sites or locations that would attract and harbor the criminal element SEC. 1200.518 WARD 5 ACTIONS IN SUPPORT OF URBAN DESIGN "The policies in support of urban design are as follows 1) Develop design standards for shielding and buffering residential zones and established neighborhoods from adjacent and nearby commercial centers and industrial areas A) Greater emphasis needs to be given to the design and buffering of industrial and commercial activities adjacent and near to residential communities to protect residents from negative impacts of incompatible design, height, scale, traffic circulation, noise, litter, employee and patron parking, and other impacts of nonresidential activities. The Langdon community petitioned the city to study and develop specific solutions to the problems associated with industrial uses operating next to stable residential homes. As a result, an overlay zone district was created which spelled out prohibited and allowed uses and provided screening B) Recommended actions i) Identify industrial and commercial centers in and near residential areas that need buffering to protect residential neighborhoods from potential negative impacts. 251 ENROLLED ORIGINAL ii) Develop design standards that protect the residential districts from adverse impacts of industrial and commercial land uses under the PUD regulations of the Zoning Commission and the Board of Zoning Adjustment and Large Tract Review procedures iii) Develop a text amendment to the Zoning Regulations which would minimize the impacts from incompatible uses and negative impacts where residential communities adjoin commercial/industrial uses iv) Develop urban design guidelines for small and medium sized commercial development adjacent to residential neighborhoods. Areas under discussion include: Twelfth Street, N.E. between Rhode Island and Michigan Avenues; Monroe Street from Seventh Street, N.E. to Twelfth Street, N.E and the Brookland Metro Station area. Also, a guideline to maintain three basic building prototypes in these areas: Rowhouses, detached houses, and neighborhood storefronts v) Commercial uses in residential zones historically take one of these three forms. The first two nearly grow out of conversion of residential uses to commercial uses. All may be compatible with the primary residential character of the areas under discussion. These prototypes are to be promoted. Strip shopping centers and other automobile primary building patterns are to be discouraged in these zone s Maintain the sidewalk as a wall, except where the less dense rowhouses or detached house forms dominate Prohibit parking between the curb and building front Maintain a Parking Area Ratio (PAR) of 1.0 in these areas under discussion Establish a PAR of .25 to .5 Limit off-street PAR per street block to .1 maximum. A street block is defined as the total square footage of commercial property along the given street between two cross streets. The intent is to provide needed parking in small pockets while maintaining the predominantly pedestrian scale, density, and patterns of the neighborhoods under discussion 2) Develop streetscape and other design guidelines to enhance the aesthetic and historic qualities of the ward’s special streets, historic districts and landmarks, as well as the gateways into the city A) Ward 5 special streets include North Capitol Street, Rhode Island Avenue, Florida Avenue, Maryland Avenue, Eastern Avenue and New York Avenue. New York Avenue also is a major gateway into the city. Other important entrances into the city include Michigan Avenue and Bladensburg l~oad. At least 22,000 average journeys are made daily by motorists on some of these routes and there are few, if any, significant markings to highlight these special streets and gateways of the ward and city B) Recommended actions i) Encourage developers and others to provide appropriate project design, landscaping, public infrastructure improvements and appropriate signage along special streets, at gateways and entrances and locations next to historic structures and districts ii) Prepare urban design guidelines for special streets, gateways, and historic landmarks. 252 ENROLLED ORIGINAL iii) Include urban design guidelines as part of new and joint development projects around Metrorail stations 3) Develop guidelines for the development of physical boundaries between commercial, industrial, and residential areas to enhance the character and integrity of all areas within the ward A) All areas, districts, and neighborhoods within the ward possess a distinct character, or identity that should be recognized as an asset and exploited to give the residents a sense of community B) Recommended actions i) Identify locations and develop urban and environmental design guidelines for the design and implementation of buffer zones in areas where conflicting adjacent land uses occur ii) Develop comprehensive urban design guidelines for individual districts or areas, in conjunction with the residents of that area, to reflect the features, qualities, or characteristics unique to that specific area. Within these guidelines, indicate appropriate locations, and signage for indication of the specific area or neighborhood iv) Encourage new development (that may act as a physical boundary adjacent to areas of strong architectural character, which complements the adjacent area by providing an aesthetically pleasing physical transition through the appropriate use of materials, scale, height, bulk, and architectural design SEC. 1200.519 WARD 5 PRESERVATION AND HISTORIC FEATURES a) The overall objective of the Historic Preservation section of the Ward 5 Plan is to preserve the important historic features in the ward while permitting new development that is responsive, sensitive and compatible with those features. Historic sites in Ward 5 include Gallaudet University, the Brooks Mansion, the homes of Ralph Bunche and Samuel Gompers, the Franciscan Monastery, the National Arboretum, Langston Terrace, and the Fort Circle Parks System, including Fort Torten, Fort Bunker Hill and Fort Lincoln b) Many residents of Ward 5 are extremely interested in historic preservation. A detailed study and inventory should be conducted to identify areas that may have historic significance. Most recently, the Hospital for Sick Children and the Glenwood Cemetery Chapel were accorded historic landmark status c) Initiatives to recognize and protect significant historic features in the ward have been successful over the last few years. Private organizations, the District and federal governments and citizens have worked together to accomplish the goal of protecting the ward’s historic heritage and enhancing the community’s identity SEC. 1200.520 WARD 5 OBJECTIVES FOR PRESERVATION AND HISTORIC FEATUI~ES "The objectives for preservation and historic features are 1) Identify, designate, protect and enhance the ward’s historic resources through sustained regulatory, enforcement and community leadership 2) Inform and educate ward residents about the ward’s historic resources and ways to protect and enhance them; and make 253 ENROLLED ORIGINAL available information about available loans and grants for historic preservation purposes to residents 3) Increase awareness of and access to historic facilities, places and activities essential to residents and visitors 4) Increase awareness and use of the National Trust for Historic Preservation resources for revitalizing historical residential, commercial, and other areas in the ward SEC. 1200.521 WARD 5 ACTIONS IN SUPPOI~T OF PRESEI~VATION AND HISTOI~IC FEATURES "The policies in support of preservation and historic features are as follows i) Protect and preserve important historic resources at the old McMillan Sand Filter site as part of future development at the site A) The MeMillan Sand Filter site was previously the major water purification facility of the National Capital water purification system. The system provided clean drinking water, from a slow sand filtering process to the District’s consumers. In 1985, the facility was abandoned and replaced with a new technology process and structure. The old facility was then declared surplus and the District acquired it for community development. Today it is one of the largest parcels owned by the city and holds significant future development potential. However, care should be taken to protect the present important historic elements of the site as part of future development before that development proceeds B) l~ecommended action i) Ensure that plans for the future development of the site adequately preserve and protect important elements of the old filtration plant as an integral part of the total development scheme for~the site ii) Preserve important historic structures, identified by the final historic resources report and pursue appropriate landmark status for preserved parts of the site 2) Conduct an historic survey in order to identify historic buildings or areas in Ward 5 A) The community has identified some initial sites, including the Langston Golf Course, Woodridge Elementary School and a carriage house in Eckington as possible historic resources. It needs to obtain technical assistance on the procedures to be followed for applying for historic status B) Recommended actions i Provide information to the Advisory Neighborhood Commissions (ANCs) and the community on the city’s procedures for making application for specific properties and sites for historic designation ii) Undertake a comprehensive historic survey of the ward with the ANCs and the community. Information should be provided about the benefits of historic preservation. Specialattention should be given to Ivy City iii) Develop methods to highlight historic landmarks in the ward, including the Fort Circle Parks and Brooks Mansion. Appropriate visual form and other methods should be identified. 254 ENROLLED ORIGINAL iv) Collaborate with the ANCs and the community to survey areas of potential historic significance in the Michigan Park, Eckington and Woodridge neighborhoods. Include appropriate structures and places to be considered for placement on the local register of historic places SEC. 1200.522 WARD 5 HUMAN SERVICES a) The human services provided within the ward include: police and fire protection, education, recreational services; medical and health care; care of persons with disabilities, children and the elderly; financial assistance and social services; and vocational rehabilitation services b) The major issues in Ward 5 regarding human services include problems of drug abuse and crime in the Bates Street, Truxton Circle, Brentwood, Langston and Trinidad/Ivy City areas; prostitution along Rhode Island and New York avenues; and the special needs of youths, the elderly and persons with disabilities c) The D.C. Department of Human Services (DHS) is the primary human service agency responsible for implementing the Human Services Element of the Comprehensive Plan. Despite limited resources, a comprehensive system is in place for the delivery of services in a coordinated, timely, efficient and humane manner. Services include pre-natal care, employment referrals, treatment for drug abuse, Aid to Families with Dependent Children, counseling and many others. Ward 5 residents have access to programs and assistance to gain and maintain independence and live full, productive lives SEC. 1200.523 WARD 5 OBJECTIVE FOR HUMAN SERVICES "The objectives for human services are 1) Offer a comprehensive range of community-based social services for those in need and to provide rehabilitative services in appropriate settings for neglected and delinquent youths 2) Promote conditions to enable persons with handicaps to participate as fully as possible in the life of the ward 3) Assist the mentally ill and mentally retarded to live and obtain needed services 4) Promote programs of health, social services and support levels for older adults to enable them to maintain themselves with a sense of security, dignity, respect and independence 5) Provide programs and activities that will facilitate the elimination of substance abuse and drug-related criminal activity SEC. 1200.524 WAI~D 5 ACTIONS IN SUPPORT OF HUMAN SERVICES "The policies in support of human services are as follows 1) Give priority attention to crime in the whole Ward 5 community. Problems of crime and drug activities in the whole Ward 5 must be addressed A) Crime, including homicides, illicit drug activity and prostitution are major problems in the ward. Drug activity has superseded prostitution as the major criminal problem in these distressed communities B) Recommended actions 255 ENROLLED ORIGINAL i) The District should develop a system in which the city officials and the Advisory Neighborhood Commissions meet to develop new programs to combat drug and crime problems throughout the Ward. At these monthly meetings an assessment of the current programs should take place ii) Distribute public information and fact sheets on public safety services to residents and businesses iii) Work with ANCs, community groups and private citizens to continue to establish more Neighborhood Watch programs, the Not on My Block program, and similar programs in crime troubled areas to reduce crime and other anti-social activities iv) Increase police presence in the whole Ward 5 Community, especially in high crime areas and areas of public housing, especially with foot patrols 2) Increase the availability and the accessibility of public health and social services for the young, the homeless, the elderly and persons with disabilities A) The District has located seven health and social service facilities, in the ward. However, the Ivy City, Truxton Circle, Edgewood and other neighborhoods are in need of the full range of services offered by District social services agencies. The Boys and Girls Clubs of Greater Washington established a social service facility in the Brentwood community that provides needed youth services to the Montana Terrace housing complex. They intend to expand program services to the larger community B) l~ecommended actions i) Evaluate the existing services and the need for additional health and social services for those in need and provide training and other rehabilitative services ii) Continue to distribute information in the community regarding the availability of health and social services offered by the District iii) Expand, coordinate and implement services for youths, the homeless, the elderly and persons with disabilities 3) Provide training for youth, tailored as so that the youth will have input in the design of projects that address crime, drug abuse, and other major areas which affect their well being A) The youth in the community should be trained in the area of "input" into the design of programs that will best serve their interest and concerns, such as nutrition, drug abuse, developing self-esteem, etc, in order to explore new ideas and methods to improve the service delivery system to this segment of the community B) Recommended actions i) Provide programs and activities that will foster Afro-centric identity and develop self-esteem and self-worth ii) Implement stronger policies against not only the drug distributors, but the drug users as well, by depleting the market for illegal drug sales iii) Continue to enforce stringent laws against prostitution, and continue to explore new methods in which to deter partaking in the illegal act of prostitution 4) Initiate a study to locate all of the shelters for the homeless in the ward, and to assess their use to the community. 256 ENROLLED ORIGINAL A) It is necessary to find out the impact of these shelters on both the ward and the city. First it is imperative that the shelters be located and assessed. The whereabouts of the shelters is not widely known. It is necessary to determine what share of homeless live in Ward 5 in comparison to the rest of D.C. Ward 5’s share of homeless shelters. In this economy it is necessary for the city to care for its homeless. It is appropriate to assure that facilities are located throughout the city for a balanced system B) Recommended actions i) Determine a formula for the distribution of homeless shelters throughout the city ii) Determine the level of services and contribution each shelter holds, and the impact on which they have on the city and Ward 5 5) Encourage the use of more volunteer services. Not only more participation, but also more use of the current non -profit organizations A) By adding more volunteer service organizations, Ward 5 could expand the services available to the community, provide additional outreach to the community and obtain much needed funds to carry out programs B) Recommended actions i) Add all known volunteer and non-profit organizations to Ward 5 organizations ii) Invite volunteer and non-profit organizations to participate in all meetings and discussions 6) Increase the availability and accessibility of public and private health and social services for the young, the homeless, the elderly and persons with disabilities. The threshold for private facilities should be where 8 or more persons will be housed A) The District has located 7 health and social service facilities in the ward. However, the Ivy City, Truxton Circle, Edgewood and other neighborhoods are in need of the full range of services offered by District social service agencies. In order to provide a full range of services to the Ward 5 neighborhoods, the plan should be expanded to include both public and private social service facilities that come under the supervision and direction of the D.C. Department of Human Services (DHS Those private and public facilities that provide social services for 8 or more people should be added to the plan as available and accessible health and social service organizations B) Recommended action: In order to provide all service facilities available to Ward 5 residents, add private facilities that presently provide services for youth, elderly, homeless and persons with disabilities to an "Information Distribution List" and present this list to the Ward 5 community 7) Increase the emphasis and training on nutritional education as a deterrent to aberrant behavior and juvenile delinquency and recidivism A) Studies indicate that by reducing sugar, salt and fats in the diet, aberrant behavior among adults and children is lessened. Studies also show that children have a higher intelligence level that take vitamins daily B) l~ecommended actions: 257 E OLLEO ORIGINAL i) Coordinate the work of the Superintendent’s Task Force on Nutrition to expand ways to bring healthier foods to Ward 5 schools in the breakfast and lunch programs and ways to educate youth more about the harmful effects of "junk foods ii) Explore areas in which nutritional education can support other human resources’ programs and, or activities, e.g, AFDC, infant mortality, etc iii) Explore ways to implement nutritional services in various institutions in Ward 5 that support the elderly, homeless, handicapped as well as youth 8) Increase the emphasis and training on AIDS prevention and sexuality A) Pregnancy and AIDS among teenagers has risen to the level that it demands priority consideration. Children are raising children, and our youth are threatened in their existence with AIDS and drugs B) Recommended actions i) Expand programs to educate youth on teen pregnancy (sexuality) and AIDS ii) Establish Center with D.C. Public Schools to coordinate activities dealing with nutrition, AIDS prevention and sexuality training SEC. 1200.525 WARD 5 LAND USE/ZONING a) Ward 5 has the second largest land area of the city’s eight wards; only Ward 3 is larger. About 4,553 acres of land, excluding public rights-of-way, or 15 percent of the city’s acreage is in Ward 5 b) About 1,400 acres are devoted to residential uses. Detached houses occupy 43 percent, or 600 acres of land. Another 36 percent, or 500 acres, is occupied by row and semi-detached houses. Detached and semi-detached houses are primarily found in the ward’s northeastern neighborhoods, such as Lamond-Riggs, Queens Chapel, Brookland and Michigan Park c) Townhouses, apartments and flats are found primarily in Langston, Trinidad, Edgewood and Truxton Circle. Fort Lincoln has a combination of these housing types. Most of the mid- and high-rise multi-family apartment buildings are in Edgewood, Fort Lincoln and Trinidad d) Institutional uses cover about 470 acres, or ten percent, of the ward’s acreage. Under this category are religious, medical and educational uses, including Catholic University of America, Trinity College, Holy Name College, the Franciscan Monastery and Gallaudet University e) Glenwood, Prospect Hill and Mount Olivet cemeteries, and open space uses cover about 1,400 acres in the ward. Other significant open spaces in the ward are the Langston Golf Course, the National Arboretum and the Fort Circle Parks including Fort Torten, Fort Lincoln and Fort Bunker Hill f) Despite the ward’s large land area, only 320 acres or seven percent of it is in commercial use. Most of the commercial acreage is along Rhode Island Avenue, Bladensburg and Benning roads, and 12th Street between Otis and Franklin streets. Smaller retail centers are along Michigan Avenue; Fourth Street; North Capitol Street, between New York 258 ENROLLED ORIGINAL and Florida Avenues; First Street N.E and Florida Avenue, N.E and Florida Avenue, between First Street, N.W. and First Street, N.E. Hechinger Mall, on Benning Road, is the only regional-serving center in the ward g) Most of the ward’s 300 acres of industrial land is located in the New York Avenue corridor, extending from Eckington Place to Eastern Avenue. Other industrial areas are along the B&amp;amp;O Railroad right-of-way, along Bladensburg Road and at the Fort Torten and Rhode Island Avenue Metrorail station areas h) The three Metrorail stations within the ward’s boundaries, the stability of many of its neighborhoods and the extensive development potential of existing industrial land provide a base for future development in the ward i) Zoning. Privately owned land in the ward is zoned residential, commercial or industrial. A major portion of the land in the ward, about 1,300 acres or 28 percent, is owned by the federal government. It is mainly parkland. By federal law, it is unzoned and not subject to the District zoning regulations j) Residential Zoning 1) The major residential zoning categories in Ward 5 are single-family detached dwellings (R-l-B row dwellings (K-3 rowhouse conversions (R-4 and multi-family, low density apartment dwellings (R-5-A They make up over 50 percent of the ward’s zoned land area (about 1,700 acres out of 3,300 acres The predominant zone is I~-I-B. It is mapped over 24 percent of the ward’s zoned land (800 acres mostly in the northern and eastern sections of the ward, which includes the Brookland, Michigan Park, Woodridge, Queens Chapel and Langdon neighborhoods 2) The southern section of the ward, below New York Avenue, has a few pockets of residential zoning in the Gateway and Arboretum communities. They consist single-family semi-detached dwellings (R-2) and row dwellings (1%-3 and R-4 These categories are mapped over 26 percent of the ward’s zoned land area (about 860 acres) and are distributed throughout the ward. The R-3 and R-4 zone categories are also found west of the B&amp;amp;O rail line with concentrations in the Eckington, Bloomingdale, Edgewood, Trinidad and Truxton Circle neighborhoods k) Commercial Zoning 1) The major commercial zone districts in the ward include neighborhood shopping centers or nodes (C-l moderate density community retail business centers (C-2-A) and medium density major business and employment centers (C-3-A They make up only about 110 acres, or three percent, of the ward’s zoned land area 2) These commercial zones are concentrated along three major transportation corridors: Rhode Island Avenue, 12th Street and the northern portion of Florida Avenue. The smallest (C-l) commercial zone is mapped along 12th and Monroe streets; Michigan and Eastern avenues; and at South Dakota Avenue and Emerson Street. The more extensive commercial zone districts are located along Rhode Island Avenue; 12th and Monroe streets; and Florida Avenue-Benning Road. The Maryland Avenue and Bladensburg Road Triangle, where the Hechinger Mall forms the major shopping component, is zoned C-3-A 1) Industrial Zoning 259 ENROLLED ORIGINAL 1) Forty percent of the city’s industrial zoned land is in Ward 5 and located along the two rail corridors. The major industrial zone districts in the ward provide for low bulk commercial/light manufacturing (C-M-l medium bulk commercial/light manufacturing (C-M-2) and general industry (M They make up 720 acres, or 22 percent, of the zoned land in Ward 5. The light manufacturing zones are principally along the New York Avenue corridor, paralleling the Amtrak rail line, and north along the B&amp;amp;O rail line up to the Fort Totten Metrorail Station and beyond into Ward 4. Other sites are in the vicinity of Florida Avenue and Benning Road, and the W Street, and Brentwood Road Industrial Park. Some non-conforming residential uses are interspersed throughout the industrial areas. They were built before 1958 when the present zoning ordinance went into effect and prohibited mixing such incompatible uses 2) The ward has about 68 percent of the city’s general industrial (M) zoned land, concentrated along New York Avenue, north of the Arboretum and also near the Fort Torten Metrorail Station SEC. 1200.526 WAI~D 5 OBJECTIVES FOR LAND USE/ZONING "The objectives for land use/zoning are 1 Protect and enhance the stability of re sidentia] neighborhoods 2) Promote economic development in the ward’s industrial corridors and commercial areas 3) Encourage and support an appropriate mix of uses in all economic development, where appropriate, including uses such as housing, parks and open space 4) Promote employment opportunities and equity investment opportunities for ward residents 5) Meet various citizens’ needs with educational, recreational and cultural facilities 6) Ensure that industrial and commercial development does not adversely impact adjacent and nearby neighborhoods, particularly with inappropriate design, traffic, parking, noise, litter, and other hazardous by-products of industry and commerce 7) Ensure that inconsistencies between the Comprehensive Plan and zoning in the ward are identified and corrected SEC. 1200.527 WARD 5 ACTIONS IN SUPPORT OF LAND USE/ZONING "The policies in support of ]and use/zoning are as follows i) Determine the appropriate mix of uses, scale and density of development for the McMil]an Sand Filter site to ensure compatibility with adjacent neighborhoods A) The McMillan site is presently unzoned, with federal and institutional ]and uses to the west and north and moderate density residential uses to the east and south. D.C. Law 8-129 designates the land for moderate density commercial, medium density residential and parks, recreation and open space.

Evaluate land use and zoning in the ward to identify changes due to current conditions. Update land use and zoning maps and documents to reflect current activity iv) Provide for citizen participation, including the surrounding Advisory Neighborhood Commissions (ANCs) in Wards 5, 4 and 1, in the development review process, to assist the District in responding to community concerns and in refining the final design 2) Determine the appropriate mix of uses, scale, density and design of development in the Fort Torten Metrorail Special Treatment Area to fully realize the site’s potential for development, to serve the Ward 5 community and city, and to protect and preserve the surrounding residential areas A) The Fort Torten Metrorail Special Treatment Area straddles the CSX Railroad tracks and extends from Riggs Road on the north to Buchanan Street N.W. on the south. The area is bordered on the north by an auto dealership, auto paint shop, radio station and cabinet craftsman shop and on the south and west by established warehouse, petroleum storage and industrial uses. Further to the north there is a shopping center. A stable residential community lies to the east. Much of the industrially zoned parcels located adjacent to the residential community in the east portion of the area are buffered from residential uses by residentially zoned property that is owned by the commercial and industrial companies but unused. Development on the industrially zoned parcels and the available three acres, owned by the Washington Area Transit Authority (WMATA proposed for joint development, must be sensitive to the surrounding communities and established land uses B) Recommended actions i) Prepare an updated small area study of the area to determine the appropriate mix of residential, commercial and industrial uses and the scale, density and design of future development ii) Provide assistance to private developers, as resources permit, that will facilitate commercial and retail development intended to support the residential population in the surrounding areas iii) Provide for the improvement of the land-use mix and urban design qualities of new development in the area through regulatory processes. 1’(iv) Ensure that development of WMATA property proposed for joint development review contributes to and is compatible with the existing character of the surrounding neighborhood.

Traffic approaching from McCormack Road onto Michigan Avenue n.eeds to be safely directed by use of traffic light signalization. Few parcels remain in the area which may be developed B) Recommended actions i) Include in development plans for the station area provisions to protect the existing low scale residential uses in the area from cut through commuter, employee uses, and other destination traffic and parking. 1~(ii) Ensure that WMATA property proposed for joint development contributes to and is compatible with the existing character of the surrounding neighborhoods iii) Improve the land use mix and urban design qualities of new development in the Brookland/CUA Metrorail Station area through the DistricCs regulatory and development review processes iv) Include Advisory Neighborhood Commissions and residents of nearby communities in the review of development projects to assist the District and WMATA in responding to community concerns 4) Determine the appropriate mix of uses, scale, density and design of development in the Rhode Island Avenue Metrorail Station area to fully realize the site’s potential for development from Metro accessibility, to serve the Ward 5 community and city, and to protect and enhance the surrounding residential areas A) The Rhode Island Avenue Metrorail Station area is bounded by Brentwood Road on the east, Rhode Island Avenue on the north, W Street on the south and Fourth Street on the west. The market has yet to facilitate development interest to a significant degree. The District’s land use priorities and budget constraints indicate comprehensive development will likely occur only in the long term B) Recommended actions i) Ensure that the Washington Metropolitan Area Transit Authority (WMATA) property proposed for joint development contributes to and is compatible with the existing character of the surrounding neighborhoods ii) Improve the land use mix and urban design qualities of new development in the Rhode Island Avenue Metrorail Station area through the DistricCs regulatory and development review processes. 262 ENROLLEO ORIGINAL iii) Coordinate development of both WMATA and District-owned land emphasizing compatible land uses, appropriate zoning densities, site design and layout, traffic control and mitigation measures, and community needs iv) Include the Advisory Neighborhood Commission and residents of nearby communities in the review of development projects to assist the District and WMATA in responding to community concerns 5) Examine the location and concentration of nonresidential uses, such as day care facilities, church offices, schools and conversions of homes to commercial uses in residential zones, to avoid the possible disruption of stable neighborhoods from potential adverse impacts A) Nonresidential uses should not be concentrated or allowed to exist in low density residential communities. Typical adverse impacts resulting from these uses in the neighborhood are congested streets, overspill of cars double-parked and lack of adequate on-site parking B) l~ecommended actions i) Complete an analysis of nonresidential uses in residential zone districts it) Develop citywide zoning text amendments to effectively control nonresidential uses permitted in residential zones to provide greater stability and protection for residential uses from potential adverse impacts 6) Recommend appropriate changes to the zoning map and regulations to make them consistent with the Comprehensive Plan, as amended by D.C. Law 8-129 A) D.C. Law 8-129 Comprehensive Plan Amendments Act of 1989 changes selected land use and density designations in the ward. This frequently makes the affected zoning not consistent with the Comprehensive Plan, as amended by the Act. Where the new land use and density designations are not consistent with existing zoning, the zoning should be changed to comply with the Comprehensive Plan B) l~ecommended actions i) Survey land uses and zoning in Ward 5 to identify locations where zoning and land uses are not consistent with each other and submit findings and recommendations to the Zoning Commission for appropriate action it) Monitor the update of the Comprehensive Plan Land Use Map as follows to ensure that zoning is consistent with the Comprehensive Plan in accordance with D.C.

This should be addressed as part of the Ward 5 Plan review process. 264 ENROLLED ORIGINAL "SUBTITLE 6 "SEC. 1200.600 "SEC. 1200.601 "SEC. 1200.602 "SEC. 1200.603 "SEC. 1200.604 "SEC. 1200.605 "SEC. 1200.606 "SEC. 1200.607 "SEC. 1200.608 "SEC. 1200.609 "SEC. 1200.610 "SEC. 1200.611 "SEC. 1200.612 "SEC. 1200.613 "SEC. 1200.614 "SEC. 1200.615 "SEC. 1200 616 "SEC. 1200.617 "SEC. 1200.618 "SEC. 1200.619 "SEC. 1200.620 "SEC. 1200.621 "SEC. 1200.622 "SEC. 1200.623 "SEC. 1200.624 "SEC. 1200.625 "SEC. 1200.626 "SEC. 1200.627 "SEC. 1200.628 "WARD 6 PLAN "TABLE OF CONTENTS WARD 6 ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT WARD 6 OBJECTIVES FOR ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT WARD 6 POLICIES IN SUPPORT OF ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT WARD 6 ACTIONS TO IMPLEMENT THE PLAN: ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT WARD 6 HOUSING WARD 6 OBJECTIVES FOR HOUSING WARD 6 POLICIES IN SUPPORT OF HOUSING OBJECTIVES WARD 6 ACTIONS TO IMPLEMENT THE PLAN HOUSING WARD 6 ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION WARD 6 OBJECTIVES FOR ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION WARD 6 POLICIES IN SUPPORT OF ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION OBJECTIVES WARD 6 ACTIONS TO IMPLEMENT THE PLAN: ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION WARD 6 TRANSPORTATION WARD 6 OBJECTIVES FOR TRANSPORTATION WARD 6 POLICIES IN SUPPORT OF TRANSPORTATION OBJECTIVES WARD 6 ACTIONS TO IMPLEMENT THE PLAN TRANSPORTATION WARD 6 PUBLIC FACILITIES WARD 6 OBJECTIVES FOR PUBLIC FACILITIES WARD 6 POLICIES IN SUPPORT OF PUBLIC FACILITIES OBJECTIVES WARD 6 ACTIONS TO IMPLEMENT THE PLAN: PUBLIC FACILITIES WARD 6 URBAN DESIGN WARD 6 OBJECTIVES FOR URBAN DESIGN WARD 6 POLICIES IN SUPPORT OF URBAN DESIGN OBJECTIVES WARD 6 ACTIONS TO IMPLEMENT THE PLAN: URBAN DESIGN WARD 6 PRESERVATION AND HISTORIC FEATURES WARD 6 OBJECTIVES FOR PRESERVATION AND tIISTORIC FEATURES WARD 6 POLICIES IN SUPPORT OF PRESERVATION AND HISTORIC FEATURES OBJECTIVES WARD 6 ACTIONS TO IMPLEMENT THE PLAN: 265 ENROLLED ORIGINAL "SEC. 1200.629 "SEC. 1200.630 "SEC. 1200.631 "SEC. 1200.632 "SEC. 1200.633 "SEC. 1200.634 "SEC. 1200.635 "SEC. 1200.636 "SEC. 1200.637 PRESERVATION AND HISTORIC FEATURES WARD 6 HUMAN SERVICES WARD 6 OBJECTIVES FOR HUMAN SERVICES WARD 6 POLICIES IN SUPPORT OF HUMAN SERVICES OBJECTIVES WARD 6 ACTIONS TO IMPLEMENT THE PLAN: HUMAN SERVICES WARD 6 LAND USE WARD 6 OBJECTIVES FOR LAND USE WARD 6 POLICIES IN SUPPORT OF LAND USE OBJECTIVES WARD 6 ACTIONS TO IMPLEMENT THE PLAN: LAND USE WARD 6 ACTIONS TO IMPLEMENT THE PLAN OTHER CHANGES "SEC. 1200.601. WARD 6 ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT a) Ward 6 offers an abundance of economic opportunity within its commercial area. These opportunities can be enhanced by a variety of actions, including ]and use studies, tailored to the different areas of the ward, small area studies, parking and loading studies, streetscape plans, tax abatement schemes and facade improvement grants and loans. Economic development themes in the ward are almost exclusively in two areas: office development and small retail business which will serve both the office and residential communities. In this regard special efforts should be made to ensure that development in Ward 6 does not compete with development in other wards on the fringe of the ward, including the Hechinger development in N.E. in Ward 5 and the opening of the Anacostia Metrorail Station on the Green Line in Ward 8. The issue in Ward 6 will be how to manage development in the best interests of the Ward 6 community and the city, as a whole. There are virtually no industrial areas in the ward except for small parcels, which are, for the most part, incompatible with current neighborhood uses b) Job opportunities within and immediately adjacent to the ward abound, provided there is requisite job training available. The many retail establishments at Union Station, along H Street, N.E at the Hechinger Mail, and along Pennsylvania Avenue, S.E offer abundant retail sales opportunities. Jobs at the federal level and with the District government can be found in large numbers at the Capitol, D.C. Genera] Hospital, Capitol Hill Hospital, and at the various prison and jail facilities. There are many office jobs at the banks and associations located along Pennsylvania Avenue and in the Union Station area. Finally, there are a myriad of jobs available in the building trades involving both large-scale development and the many remodeling activities within the ward’s two historic districts. The issue is not lack of jobs but training to qualify for the jobs c) Much of the economic activity throughout the ward has specialized characteristics which need to be assessed in developing the planning, land use, parking, and loading regulations necessary to promote businesses. The area encompassed by the Capitol Interest Overlay Zone extends from the Capitol grounds to 6th Street, S.E and N.E. from the Freeway on the south to F Street on the north. Within 266 ENROLLED ORIGINAL that zone are a number of important commercial areas: Pennsylvania Avenue, S.E 2nd Street, S.E from Massachusetts Avenue north to H Street, N.E Massachusetts Avenue, N.E. around Stanton Park, and 2nd Street, N.E from Massachusetts Avenue to F Street. This area serves both the large daytime populations working in and visiting the Capitol as well as the immediately adjacent residential neighborhoods. The key issue is to provide a variety of retail services and to resist the trend toward bars and restaurants, exclusively d) Similar considerations exist along both Pennsylvania Avenue, S.E above the CID and along H Street, N.E. A combination of the 600 block of Pennsylvania Avenue, S.E the Eastern Market Metro stop, 7th Street, S.E between 6th and 9th Streets, North Carolina Avenue, and the Freeway and 8th Street between the Metro stop and Navy Yard (Market Row with Eastern Market in the middle) and 9th Street, S.E between the Metro stop and the Navy Yard constitute the Capitol Hill Central Business District. This area is already under substantial development: Eastern Market revitalization, Penn Medical Building, the Kresge Building, the Miller Building, and the row of buildings across from the Market e) East of 9th Street, N.E on Pennsylvania Avenue, there is a need to study both the Avenue itself and for a small-area study at the intersection of the Avenue, Potomac Avenue and 14th Street, S.E where the Potomac Avenue Metro Station is located. Such a study would help rationalize conflicting land uses in the area. In addition, with the entire length of Pennsylvania Avenue, S.E as a designated landmark and the primary entrance to the Capitol from the east, a special streetscape plan and land use control should be developed. At the Barney Circle end of the Avenue, there is already a proliferation of fast-food outlets and abandoned service stations which discourage investment in facilities of higher quality as well as denigrate the landmark stature of the Avenue f) H Street, N.E has a different character than Pennsylvania Avenue, S.E but similar problems. At one time it was the second busiest commercial area in the District. That function diminished in the 1960s and nearly disappeared after the riots of 1968. The H Street corridor has experienced some revitalization as a result of an Urban Renewal Plan; however, the development of the Hechinger Mall on the east end of the corridor and the substantial office and retail space in the area of Union Station on the west end tend to drain off retail investment and customers from the rest of H Street. This polarization of economic activity needs to be considered in reviewing H Street development. Between the two ends of heavy development, H Street may have to assume a special character in order to fully develop its commercial potential g) An inter-ward, under-utilized economic development opportunity is Benning Road, N.E from the Hechinger Mall to the Anacostia River. Its potential needs to be studied. Certain retail possibilities should be considered for this area, including extending the Stadium Farmers Market to Benning Road and the re-creation of an automobile dealership which once existed there h) Scattered throughout the west end of the Ward are short strips of commercial activity which need to be studied in order to understand and assess how they could better function or whether their land use should change. These areas include llth Street, S.E. lust off Pennsylvania Avenue; 8th Street, N.W north of Capitol Hill Hospital; 267 ENROLLED ORIGINAL the Potomac Avenue, Pennsylvania Avenue, 14th Street area and various strips along 15th Street, S.E. and N.E. Also scattered throughout the area are non-conforming land uses most of which are now neighborhood-related services: drug stores, corner groceries, dry cleaners, hair dressers, etc. These stores not only perform essential services for the community but also give the area vitality i) On the east side of the ward there is a detailed plan for economic and related development in Anacostia developed by the Anacostia Coordinating Council and endorsed by most of the affected Ward 6 groups and relevant public officials. It is published as a Development Concept Plan entitled "Anacostia: A Capital Gain and has been circulated widely in the community for more than three years. It involves a variety of public agency actions and policies, which are enumerated in the relevant implementation sections contained in the Ward 6 Plan. Included in the Development Concept Plan are provisions for streetscape improvements, basic land use plans and appropriate controls for future development of key sites, traffic and parking improvements, and historic preservation j) The Anacostia Development Concept Plan is a legitimate small-area plan within the context of the city’s comprehensive plan and is adopted as such as part of the Ward 6 Plan SEC. 1200.602. WARD 6 OBJECTIVES FOR ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT The objectives for economic development are as follows 1) To encourage a range of commercial services and facilities for Ward 6 residents through appropriate development of commercial areas when needed and to upgrade commercial areas such as the Martin Luther King, Jr Avenue, S.E and Good Hope Road, S.E corridors, the H Street, N.E. and Benning Road, N.E corridor, Pennsylvania Avenue, S.E corridor, 7th and 8th Streets, S.E 2) To stimulate economic activity and employment opportunities and growth consistent with the respective needs of the various neighborhoods in Ward 6 SEC. 1200.603. WARD 6 POLICIES IN SUPPORT OF ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT The policies in support of economic development are as follows 1) Provide a range of commercial facilities and services within commercial corridors in Ward 6 2) Ensure that new commercial developments in Ward 6 are consistent with the character of the adjacent historic districts 3) Ensure that the redevelopment of the commercial corridors, such as H Street, N.E Martin Luther King, Jr Avenue, S.E and Good Hope Road, S.E include a large percentage of neighborhood-serving commercial uses 4) Where development opportunities exist, the city and the Ward 6 community should work to ensure that they are consistent with neighborhood and city objectives SEC. 1200.604. WARD 6 ACTIONS TO IMPLEMENT THE PLAN: ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT The actions to implement economic development are as follows: 268 ENROLLED ORIGINAL 1) Prepare comprehensive analysis of land use in the Massachusetts Avenue, N.E 7th and 8th Streets, S.E and Pennsylvania Avenue, S .E commercial corridors 2) Select sites which have potential for increased FAR to attract economic development in commercial districts 3) Designate area around Potomac Avenue Metro station as a Special Treatment Area. Boundaries of the special study area are llth Street, S.E. on the west (including the llth Street commercial corridor D Street, S.E. on the north, Kentucky Avenue on the east, and Southeast/Southwest Freeway on the south. Special Treatment Area study to include development of underutilized commercial sites e.g Began property at 14th and Potomac Avenue, S.E protection of residential properties and neighborhoods in the study area, including the residential neighborhood south of Pennsylvania Avenue bounded by 13th Street, S.E on the west, Pennsylvania Avenue on the north, 15th Street, S.E on the east, and the Southeast/Southwest Freeway on the south. Special Treatment Area analysis to emphasize economic development potential in balance with predominately residential character of the area 4) Ensure that the future development and/or expansion of Capitol grounds conforms with guidelines and sequences set out in Master Plan with U.S. Capitol 5) Ensure that future development of land transferred from the Architect of the Capitol to the District private ownership conforms with existing uses in adjacent and surrounding areas 6) Encourage and concentrate medical-related and neighborhood serving commercial uses in area of 8th Street, N.E between C &amp;amp; E Streets. This area is currently designated low density commercial, neighborhood business center 7) l~estore Eastern Market as retail meat, produce center and farmers~ row built around core of existing Farmers~ Market. Community meeting and performing and visual arts space to be included in improvement program 8) Create Capitol Hill Central Business District shopping area by integrating Market l~ow, Pennsylvania Avenue, S.E 6th Street, S.E to 9th Street, S.E and Barracks l~ow retail areas through the device of a special treatment area 9) l~eassess H Street, N.E Corridor Urban Renewal Plan to account for changed economic development potential in corridor. Consider entirely new Urban Renewal Plan to provide incentives for housing, community services, neighborhood recreation facilities 10) Confine commercial activities to Benning tread, N.E. frontage in Kingman Park area of the ward 11) l~etain open-air Farmers~ Market at Stadium/Armory parking lots 12) Improve range and quality of retail business along 15th Street, S.E and upgrade neighborhood convenience/shopping services 13) Promote/sustain economic vitality of business concerns lawfully established and operating on Pennsylvania Avenue, S.E 7th and 8th Streets, S.E and Massachusetts Avenue, N.E commercial corridors. 269 ENROLLED ORIGINAL 14) Protect adjacent residential neighborhoods in Northeast against pressures for conversion to retail and office uses generated by Union Station development 15) Develop old Anacostia as an integrated retail small office, and light industrial employment/service center designed to complement the area’s historic district and stable neighborhoods 16) Limit existing commercial facilities to present sites and densities in Twining/Greenway area of Ward 6. Upgrade appearance of facilities and improve type and mix of services available to meet community needs. Commercial districts requiring renovation are those located at Nelson Street and Minnesota Avenue, S.E and Benning Road, S.E and Pennsylvania Avenue and Minnesota Avenues, S.E 17) Maintain and improve Good Hope Road commercial area in a manner compatible with residential character of Fairlawn and Anacostia neighborhoods 18) Upgrade the level of services and outlets along the Good Hope l~oad commercial corridor 19) Designate a new special treatment area between Eastern Market Metro, 8th and 7th Streets, S.E. between Pennsylvania Avenue and the expressway: Pennsylvania Avenue from 6th Street to 9th Street, S.E 7th and 8th Streets, from Pennsylvania to expressway, 7th Street, S.E. from Pennsylvania Avenue to North Carolina Avenue SEC.1200.605. WARD 6 HOUSING a) Ward 6 has a great diversity of housing available to its residents. The housing stock ranges from large public housing projects to smaller subsidized units, to large row-house districts, to neighborhoods of detached single-family homes. The west end of the ward contains the bulk of the older row-house neighborhoods, many of which were built in the 19th century and are part of the Capitol Hill Historic District. Although the western portion of the ward (west of the Anacostia River) is relatively small in land area, its population density is high due to the row-house character of its housing. There are also a few scattered small apartment houses throughout the west side of the ward, many of which have been converted to condominiums b) On the east side of the ward, the Anacostia Historic District contains a number of wooden, detached houses, many of which require substantial renovation in order to maintain their residential uses. These are interspersed with large, multifamily units built in the 1950s and 1960s to accommodate families displaced in the redevelopment of Southwest. Many of these are vacant and all require substantial renovation. They are, as a rule, built on too large a scale and are too densely clustered to be compatible with the underlying neighborhood. Some of these buildings should be demolished at the end of their useful lives and replaced with smaller, compatible buildings e) The Twining/Greenway neighborhood contains a large concentration of small, detached houses. This neighborhood, in particular, has been encroached upon by a number of small apartment houses which tend to undermine the integrity of the area as a single-family residential neighborhood. There are also several brick row-house neighborhoods in the eastern section of the ward. Much of the housing east of the Anacostia River requires additional maintenance. 270 ENROLLED ORIGINAL Homeowners require assistance in their efforts to maintain their properties, thus stabilizing the residential quality of the area d) There is little vacant property available for development in Ward 6. The vacant parcels that exist are small in size and most suitable for infill development. Increasing the housing supply and helping the homeowner afford his or her property can be accomplished by renting portions of the structures that have two units, i.e English basements. Other ways to increase the housing supply include conversion of schools and churches to apartments and condominiums, and by creating new apartment development along H Street, N.E and Pennsylvania Avenue e) Although more housing units are rented than are owned in Ward 6, recent trends show an increase in home ownership. Since home ownership is a stabilizing force in residential neighborhoods, public policy needs to strengthen that trend by a number of means, including provision of subsidies for first-owner mortgages and tax abatements for ownership. Another positive trend involves assisting public housing residents to own their units, thus stabilizing those projects. Whether public housing tenants become owners, or continue as renters, they need to be encouraged and assisted to properly maintain the homes they occupy SEC. 1200.606. WARD 6 OBJECTIVES FOR HOUSING The objectives for housing are as follows 1) To maintain and strengthen the quality and construction of housing in the various neighborhoods throughout Ward 6 v(2) To stimulate production in Ward 6 of new and rehabilitated housing, particularly in the Anacostia Historic District, t~airlawn and Woodlawn neighborhoods, to provide housing opportunities to accommodate and allow for residential growth and stability according to area needs VSEC. 1200.607. WARD 6 POLICIES IN SUPPORT O1~ HOUSING OBJECTIVES The policies in support of housing objectives are as follows 1) Maintain the housing stock through the provision of additional loans and grants to Ward 6 homeowners for housing rehabilitation, appropriate changes in regulatory codes and encouragement of in-fill development on vacant lots 2} Discourage encroachment of the non-residential uses in residential areas 3) Stimulate private investment in housing in Ward 6 and expand home ownership opportunities. ’I(4) Provide new housing in Ward 6 area through the conversion of appropriate non-residential structures that have outlived their current use, such as churches, warehouses, schools and other public facilities SEC. 1200.608. WARD 6 ACTIONS TO IMPLEMENT THE PLAN: HOUSING The actions to implement housing are as follows: vt(1) Preserve primarily moderate-density residential character of area bordering U.S. Capitol grounds 2) Preserve character of residential neighborhoods. Curtail conversions of residential properties to commercial/office use. 271 ENROLLED ORIGINAL 3) Promote preservation and enhancement of low- and moderate-income housing development opportunities, and provide incentives to encourage low- and moderate-income home ownership 4) Transient housing (inns, small hotels, etc should be designed in a manner compatible with the Ward’s predominantly residential character 5) Prohibit further carriage-house conversions and resulting higher densities 6) Complete original car barn PUD 7) Encourage construction of new and infill housing in and around Anacostia Historic District with no increased densities 8) Provide incentives to encourage home ownership and occupancy 9) Improve the mix of subsidized and nonsubsidized dwelling units to enhance neighborhood stability 10) Rehabilitate and maintain selected public housing projects in Ward 6. Renovate and convert selected units as owner-occupied cooperative housing 11) Pursue renovation of Rose’s t~ow (1200 block of U Street, S.E for single family dwellings as is now ocurring 12) Prepare alternative site development plans for the housing along east side of Martin Luther King, Jr Avenue between Morris Road and Howard Road in conjunction with Ward 8 13) Establish community-based financing system to promote home ownership in Anacostia neighborhood 14) Preserve residential character of Twining/Greenway neighborhood with no increased density 15) ttehabilitate deteriorating housing stock in Twining/Greenway neighborhood, especially small, single-family houses west of Minnesota Avenue, S.E 16) Encourage conversion of low-rise apartment buildings in Twining/Greenway neighborhood to owner occupied 17) Preserve residential character of Fairlawn neighborhood with no increased densities 18) l~ehabilitate deteriorating housing stock in Fairlawn neighborhood, primarily single-family homes and small apartment buildings in subarea 19) Preserve residential character of Woodlawn neighborhood, with no increased density housing 20) Inventory all unoccupied or boarded-up dwellings in the Ward and act to return these dwellings to habitable uses 21) Establish and maintain coordination between the District and the Architect of the Capitol to better manage the need for and production of federal dormitory-style housing in the Capitol Hill neighborhood 22) Work cooperatively with neighborhood organizations to formulate development and implementation plans for the Ellen Wilson Dwellings, emphasizing the creation of mixed-income, owner-occupied and rental housing SEC. 1200.609. WARD 6 ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION a) Environmental protection is an issue that has become increasingly important over the past decade. The Potomac River, which 272 ENROLLEI) ORIGJNAL was the model cleanup project for the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency*s water quality improvement efforts, is being restored to its former state and once again supports a broad range of aquatic life. Air quality in the District has improved substantially since the mid-1960s b) Environmental protection is a regional concern that often must rely on regional solutions for success. Maryland, Virginia and the District of Columbia have increased their cooperative efforts to improve environmental quality. Of particular importance to Ward 6 are the efforts currently underway by the District of Columbia and the State of Maryland to improve conditions in the Anacostia River and its tributaries. These efforts are part of a comprehensive program for restoring the Chesapeake Bay being undertaken by the District, Maryland, Virginia, Delaware and Pennsylvania under the guidelines of the Environmental Protection Agency c) Pollution of the Anacostia l~iver and deterioration of its shorelines present serious environmental problems. These conditions have had negative consequences for aquatic life and have limited use of the river for recreational purposes. Now the Anacostia Kiver Basin is receiving the attention given the Potomac Kiver during its cleanup efforts. The river cleanup project will require the combined efforts of the District, Prince Georges County and the National Park Service. In the District, high traffic volume, poor water quality, soil erosion and other concerns are being approached with new awareness. The Department of Public Works (DPW) and other District government agencies are implementing improvements in sewer maintenance and medical waste management. Guidelines for homeowners to help improve environmental quality are provided by DCRA d) The Swirl Concentrator, a computer-operated interim sewage treatment plant, recently began operating just east of D.C. General Hospital. The plant will help alleviate sewage capacity problems at Blue Plains Wastewater Treatment Plant e) With the District governmenCs renewed efforts to improve environmental quality, progress is being made. The first stages of the long-awaited Anacostia Kiver cleanup is beginning. The Department of Public Works is implementing its Combined Sewer Overflow Abatement Master Plan. The Swirl Concentrator is part of that planVs implementation. Improvements to other aspects of the wastewater and stormwater management system are also included. These capital improvements will also improve water quality in the Anacostia Kiver. Heavy traffic volumes along the ward’s major arterials cause hazardous air quality conditions for surrounding neighborhoods. The U.S. Capitol Power Plant operations have raised neighborhood concern about air quality conditions. In addition, DPW and the Council of Governments are developing improved air quality management procedures. Increasing use of mass transit is an important feature in improving air quality f) Soil erosion in ~airlawn and Anacostia threatens the neighborhood quality. Erosion along the southwest section of t~ort Stanton Park is beginning to effect trees in that area of the park g) The Department of Public Works has helped improve neighborhood environmental quality and has intensified efforts to regularly clean alleys, schedule bulk trash collection, and remove downed trees and other road hazards. 273 ENROLLED ORIGINAL "SEC. 1200.610. WARD 6 OBJECTIVES FOR ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION The objectives for environmental protection are as follows 1) To improve the quality of water in the District’s rivers and streams to meet public health and water quality standards and to maintain the physical, chemical and biological integrity of these watercourses for multiple uses, including recreation 2) To protect the overall environmental quality of the Ward 6 land areas by preventing further soil erosion, promoting the restoration of eroded areas and enforcing prohibitions against illegal dumping and other destructive practices 3) Reduce the level of noise and litter, and improve air quality SEC. 1200.611. WARD 6 POLICIES IN SUPPORT OF ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION OBJECTIVES The policies in support of environmental protection objectives are as follows 1) Minimize overflows of untreated sewage from the combined sewerage system, and develop and implement a reliable program of solid waste and sludge disposal that is cost-effective, environmentally sound, and fully coordinated with all responsive jurisdictions and regulatory bodies 2) Prevent further sedimentation of stream beds and valleys, whenever possible 3) Regulate land development activities including public spaces, throughout the Ward 6 area to protect natural features, prevent soil erosion, and prohibit construction practices that produce unstable soil and hillside conditions 4) Regulate noise levels of buses, trucks, and airplanes and provide alternative routes where practicable SEC. 1200.612. WARD 6 ACTIONS TO IMPLEMENT THE PLAN: ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION The actions to implement environmental protection are as follows I) Control gaseous and particulate emissions from the Capitol Power Plant and noise emissions from the Refrigeration Plant 2) Identify appropriate authority and establish mechanism, including negotiated District of Columbia/Architect of the Capitol agreement, if necessary, to control Capitol Power and Refrigeration Plant emissions 3) Protect residential neighborhoods from tour bus-generated congestion, noise and noxious emissions 4) Take appropriate steps to protect and maximize overall quality 5) Protect adjacent residential and commercial areas from adverse affect of Southwest/Southeast Freeway, including noxious emissions, visual and noise blight 6) Control diesel emissions and tunnel fan blowouts of accumulated smoke at mouth of Washington Terminal Company (Amtrak) tunnel, D Street and New Jersey Avenue, S.E 7) Protect surrounding residential neighborhood from oil spillage and other adverse environmental effects caused by Johnny 274 ENROLLED ORIGINAL Matthews Fuel Service, 630 14th Street, N.E.

WARD 6 TRANSPORTATION a) The area of Ward 6 west of the Anacostia River is served by a combination of public transportation systems making automobile usage for local trips by its residents almost unnecessary. The east side of the River one of the most transit-dependent sections of the city is served by Metrobus and Metrorail service. Unfortunately, most of the ward, particularly the west side, is intersected by auto commuter routes serving nearby Maryland residents and residents of the Anacostia area of the District. There are four Metrorail stations within the ward and two immediately adjacent. The Capitol complex and close-in Capitol Hill are served by two stations: Capitol South and Union Station. Southeast Capitol Hill is served by Eastern Market, Potomac Avenue and Stadium/Armory stations. Anacostia served by the Anacostia Green Line station. Major bus routes transverse the ward. Train and intercity bus service is available at or near Union Station. National Airport is easily accessible via the Southeast/Southwest Freeway or the Blue Line Metro route. It should also be noted that the wide sidewalks and street trees make walking to work pleasurable for Capitol Hill residents b) The most difficult transportation issue is the role of the automobile. Accommodation of residents’ automobiles is a difficult problem and a challenge in what is primarily a series of 19th century neighborhoods. Requiring a parking spot in this area needs reexamination, l~equiring a parking spot in each new residence often leads to a curb cut with a loss of on-street parking and no replacement because the new parking space is often not used for parking. Similarly, 275 ENROLLED ORIGINAL the blanket policy of grandfathering parking for existing buildings in the Historic District achieves uneven results W(c) A major success, but one needing further refinement, is permit parking. There needs to be an examination of whether or not residents of the ward are abusing permit parking and using the streets near Metro stops as all-day parking lots. Enforcement of this problem needs to be evaluated, and the issue of extending permit parking needs to be addressed. There is also the problem of all-day parkers from the Capitol complex, the Library of Congress, and employees of business who simply move their cars every two hours to stay within the regulatory limits. W(d) A major problem in Ward 6 on the east and west sides of the river, is the use of neighborhood streets as commuter thoroughfares. This problem is exacerbated by frequent severe congestion and tie-ups along major commuter arterials. The situation is getting worse because of extensive office and retail development in the Union Station area and increasing residential development in Maryland from the District line to Annapolis. One proposal is the development of the Barney Circle Freeway project, which includes linkages from 1-295 to the Southwest Freeway at Barney Circle, with an additional linkage at Barney Circle by means of a roadway between East Capitol Street and the Southeast Freeway. While the design and purpose of the Barney Circle Freeway were established after extensive consultation with Capitol Hill residents, its effects on the ward remain uncertain. That plan calls for additional lanes within the existing Southeast Freeway roadbed, and one-way streets in the Capitol Hill area will be returned to two-way traffic. The stated purpose is to direct commuter traffic into the District using commercial streets or freeways built to accommodate such traffic. This will not solve the problem but may give some relief while other techniques are employed, such as greater emphasis on van pooling, use of buses, Metro, and HOV lanes. Commuter traffic remains one of the biggest threats to the quality of residential life in Ward 6 e) Development east of the river, spurred by the Anacostia Metro site, is provoking parking problems similar to those that plague Capitol Hill. The Metro garage planned for the Anacostia Metro station will not provide all necessary parking. Also, the economic revitalization of the Good Hope Road corridor depends upon shoppers being able to park to use the stores SEC. 1200.614. WARD 6 OBJECTIVES FOR TRANSPORTATION The objectives for transportation are as follows 1) To provide an adequate balanced circulation system, properly related to residential, commercial/retail, and other land uses, which will enhance the aesthetic and environmental characteristics along streets in the Ward 6 area as well as to minimize traffic congestion 2) To develop, as appropriate, a network of trails, including hiking and biking, designed to connect residential, employment, education, and open space areas and to provide for the journey-to-work needs of Ward 6 residents. Provide secure bicycle racks in appropriate areas including Metro stations v(3) To integrate circulation facilities with the patterns of development and the natural environment in the Ward 6 areas in a manner that will minimize noise and air pollution and at the same time provide for the safe, convenient movement of people and goods. 276 ENROLLED ORIGINAL 4) To support the optimum use of mass transit by residents of Ward 6 and by workers, visitors, and tourists who come to the ward SEC. 1200.615. WARD 6 POLICIES IN SUPPORT OF TRANSPORTATION OBJECTIVES The policies in support of transportation are as follows 1) Develop a pathway system in the Ward 6 areas that interconnects neighborhoods, employment, recreation, schools, and open space areas, where feasible, with access to the Metro system 2) Seek to ensure that development adjacent to the Ward 6 Metrorail Stations enhances ridership 3) Minimize conflicts between vehicular and pedestrian traffic 4) Work with the Architect of the Capitol to reduce parking and traffic impacts in areas adjacent to the Capitol as a result of office development 5) Minimize, commensurate with the policy in paragraph (4 the number of one-way streets in the Capitol IIill Historic District 6) Give increased attention to bus service east of the river SEC. 1200.616.

Federal Center. 278 ENROLLED ORIGINAL "SEC. 1200.617. WAleD 6 PUBLIC FACILITIES a) There are a substantial number of public facilities located in Ward 6. These include District and federal facilities such as the Municipal Center, the Capitol of the United States, the U.S. Department of Labor and the U.S. Tax Court on the western edge, the Navy Yard and the Southeast Federal Center on the southern edge; Anacostia Park on both sides of the river; and the Stadium/Armory complex containing the Stadium/Armory, D.C. General Hospital, D.C. Jail, and the D.C. Correctional Treatment Facility. In the southwest part of the ward, there are the Washington Metropolitan Area Transit Authority (WMATA Southeast Metrobus Garage and the District-owned O Street Pumping Station. In addition, there are numerous Community-Based l~esidential Facilities CBItFs throughout the ward, as well as a number of large public housing projects: Ellen Wilson (vacant since 1988 Potomac Gardens, Kentucky Courts, Woodland Terace, Arthur Capper Dwellings, Carrollsburg Apartments and Hopkins Apartments b) In order to deal with impact of these facilities each should have some planning for their future development. The Architect of the Capitol has developed a Master Plan for the Capitol of the United States which could be a model for planning. The Navy Yard requires an updated master plan which would be overseen by the National Capital Planning Commission. As Union Station develops, there is planning for its traffic impact on the residential areas. Capitol Hill IIospital should have a master plan for its activities. The District government requires a number of plans: for the area encompassed by D.C. General Hospital, the jail, the prisons and the Stadium/Armory. It should also have a plan for its numerous public housing projects which occupy many squares in the area. The school system requires a master plan for the disposition and reuse of its underutilized or abandoned schools. And finally, the District government needs to plan for the equitable disbursement of its CBI~Fs so that there is minimal impact on residential neighborhoods, not only of Ward 6, but throughout tim District, except that the disbursement shall not violate the Fair Housing Amendments Act, approved March 12, 1989 (102 Stat. 1619; 42 U.S.C. 3601 et seq Fair Housing Act For the purposes of this subsection, the term ’handicap’ has the same meaning as in section 802(h) of the Fair Housing Act (42 U.S.C. 3602(h SEC. 1200.618. WARD 6 OBJECTIVES FOR PUBLIC FACILITIES The objectives for public facilities are as follows 1) To provide adequate facilities for the efficient distribution of services that promote the health, education and welfare of the citizens of Ward 6 SEC. 1200.619.

WAleD 6 UI~BAN DESIGN a) Ward 6 has a number of unique features which fits its character for any urban design planning. Of special note are the large historic districts in the Ward: the Capitol Hill Historic District on the west side and the Historic District in Anacostia. Since these constitute 40% of the ward’s land, and the surrounding areas resemble them in physical appearance, it is their character which is a determinate of urban design for the ward. Most of the urban design issues consist of developing detailed streetscape designs for public spaces: sidewalk materials, lighting, signage, benches, plantings, fencing, trash containers, controls over placement of vending machines and trash containers in the public spaces by private persons, as well as controls on curb cuts and enhancements of the street tree program b) On the west side of the ward special attention needs to be given to the following area. In conjunction with the National Park Service, a streetscape plan needs to be performed and implemented for Pennsylvania Avenue, S.E to Barney Circle. The Park Service is responsible for the Esplanade. The District is responsible for the sidewalks, lighting and street trees. At Pennsylvania Avenue and the Eastern Market Metro Stop there needs to be an extension of the Avenue streetscape into 7th Street to North Carolina Avenue down to 8th Street, S.E to the Navy Yard in order to establish the visual character of that area as the central business district of Capitol Hill. The center piece of this consists of the re-design of the Eastern Market Metro Park to provide for more shade, better lighting, different landscaping, etc all appropriate for a Victorian neighborhood. A similar design issue exists at the Potomac Avenue Metro stop, which should be made part of the small area study for that neighborhood. Finally, there should be a major design study for the Barney Circle entry way at the point where the Avenue starts east over the Anacostia l~iver. There may also be merit in extending Pennsylvania Avenue streetscape design all the way out to 281 ENROLLED ORIGINAL the Maryland line but on a less grand scale in order to delineate Barney Circle as the major entry to the U.S. Capitol c) Also on the western end of the ward, there needs to be an implementation of the "transition zone" mentioned in the Architect for the Capitol’s master plan for the U.S. Capitol. An appropriate streetscape would denote the point at which the private and district lines meet the edges of the Capitol Grounds. That should be accomplished in conjunction with the Architect of the Capitol d) Whenever the District and the Park Service have joint responsibility for parks large and small in the ward, there should be a coordinated plan for fencing, lighting, walkways, and, most important, a security and maintenance plan for each park. These areas add considerably to the character of the areas and are vital to any meaningful plan for urban design of Ward 6 e) Finally, on the west end of the ward, a distinctive streetscape plan is necessary to establish the character and undergrid the viability of the H Street commercial corridor f) A similarly detailed streetscape plan for Anacostia is needed to assist in implementation of the Anacostia Coordinating Council’s plan for that area. As with the Capitol Hill Historic District, the Anacostia Historic District should be the core around which a streetscape is designed g) The Twining/Greenway area requires a streetscape appropriate to its character in order to help retain its character as a single family residence area. This area also requires buffering from the rail tracks and rail yard on its western side. Finally, Interstate 295 (Kenilworth Avenue) needs to have an urban design scheme to buffer it from the adjacent neighborhoods and also to give those who use the road a better impression of the urban areas through which they are passing SEC. 1200.622. WARD 6 OBJECTIVES FOR UP, BAN DESIGN The objectives for urban design are as follows 1) To acknowledge and protect the unique architectural character of Ward 6 and preserve the continuity of the well established, essential and historic areas 2) To ensure that new development that occurs in Ward 6 complements and translates land uses into compatible, physical settings and preserves and enhances the outstanding qualities of the natural park areas 3) To encourage a high quality of architecture consistent with the styles and characteristics of buildings in Ward 6 SEC. 1200.623. WAleD 6 POLICIES IN SUPPORT OF URBAN DESIGN OBJECTIVES The policies in support of urban design objectives are as follows 1) Ensure that redeveloped and new structures in Ward 6 commercial corridors strengthen the urban design image of those areas and relate to adjacent residential neighborhoods 2) Install appropriately designed signs and markers to identify the designated historic districts in Ward 6 3) Find ways to enhance the environment surrounding Eastern Market and to reinforce the key elements of the L’Enfant Plan in Ward 6 West in future development activities. 282 ENROLLED ORIGINAL 4) Provide streetscape improvements, trees, signs, lights and other such elements to enhance the environment in Ward 6 5) Continue to improve the design and upkeep of public spaces, including streets, sidewalks, small open spaces and large formal squares in Ward 6 SEC. 1200.624. WARD 6 ACTIONS TO IMPLEMENT THE PLAN: URBAN DESIGN The actions to implement urban design are as follows I) Adopt and apply streetscape and aesthetic standards and controls for U.S. Capitol Master Plan-designated transition zone between the Capitol grounds and adjacent residential areas in conjunction with local community 2) Develop comprehensive streetscape design standards and controls for the Capitol Hill Historic District 3) Develop streetscape controls for Massachusetts Avenue corridor; specific attention to curtailment and regulation of sidewalk cafes, especially "enclosed" sidewalk cafes 4) Protect the historic character of Pennsylvania Avenue corridor, S.E. and enhance image and use of avenue as ceremonial gateway to the U.S. Capitol through special streetscape controls and design standards 5) Develop special streetscape controls and design standards for Pennsylvania Avenue corridor, including Seward Square area, with objective of integrating the two commercial streets radiating from the square (7th Street, S.E. to the North and 8th Street, S.E. to the south 6) Continue National Park Service jurisdiction in Lincoln Park 7) Preserve special character of East Capitol Street 8) Provide landscaping and screening to mitigate adverse appearances of sprawling parking lots at the stadium site 9) Establish strict design controls of commercial signage, awnings, street furniture and trash receptacles 10) Improve small park areas along Pennsylvania Avenue and adjacent commercial corridors through special landscaping, lighting, street furniture.

WARD 6 PRESERVATION AND HISTORIC FEATURES a) Historic preservation is a dominant issue in Ward 6. Nearly 40% of the ward’s land area is in the historic districts. The Capitol Hill Historic District is the largest historic district on the National Register of Historic Sites and Places with nearly 8,000 structures. The Anacostia Historic District encompasses approximately 25 blocks surrounding the Frederick Douglass House, a national landmark. In addition to the Historic Districts, there are a number of historic sites in and around the historic areas. The Capitol Hill Historic District contains such specifically designated sites as the Eastern Market, Marine Barracks, Pennsylvania Avenue, S.E Women’s Party House, Friendship House (the Maples) and 283 ENROLLED ORIGINAL immediately adjacent, the Capitol of the United States, Supreme Court and Library of Congress. On the south of the Capitol Hill Historic District is the Navy Yard and on the near northeast, Union Station. The Capitol Hill Historic District is characterized by being developed along the L’Enfant street plan for the old city of Washington and possesses an extensive alley system and large inner courts which add to the light and air of the area. Finally, there is an entire square block just outside the District, the Old Car Barn, which is a specifically designated landmark. Adjacent to the Anacostia River is the 25-acre Congressional Cemetery, also a specifically designated landmark b) Anacostia consists of numerous wooden buildings and dwellings which date from the mid-to-late 19th century and constitute what was once a discrete village located within what was largely farmland at the time of its development. There is also a specifically designated landmark, Cedar Hill, the former home of abolitionist Frederick Douglass. Cedar Hill is maintained by the National Park Service and open to visitors c) There are substantial protections which attach to these historic districts and specifically designated landmarks. All additions, alterations, demolitions, and new construction must go before the local Preservation Review Board. In addition, the District is supposed to protect against demolition by neglect and bar any demolition without a hearing SEC. 1200.626. WARD 6 OBJECTIVES FOR PRESERVATION AND HISTORIC FEATURES The objectives for the preservation and historic features are as follows 1) To develop programs and activities that recognize and promote the valuable historic resources in Ward 6 and to increase awareness of and access to those facilities, activities and places 2) To protect and preserve the historic character of the residential neighborhoods in the Capitol Hill and Anacostia Historic District, including Congressional Cemetery 3) To encourage new development and renovations of structures that are sensitive to the character of the historic districts in Ward 6 4) To monitor the use, modifications, and proposed demolitions of buildings to ensure preservation and compatibility with historic districts in the Ward 6 area SEC. 1200.627.

WARD 6 HUMAN SERVICES a) The change in the ward’s demographic patterns has shifted demands for human services. As Capitol Hill and Stanton Park were renovated, social workers noted a signif]cant decrease in the number of people on welfare and reliance upon assistance in these areas. Still, segments of the ward’s population remain in need of the District’s social, economic and health support systems. 285 ENROLLED ORIGINAL b) Ward 6 east of the Anacostia River has a high unemployment rate, low overall educational attainment level, high percentage of low- and moderate-income single parent households, and a growing number of Community Based Residential Facilities CBRFs They provide vital services for those persons with disabilities, the homeless, and those in need of substance-abuse treatment. Placement of CBRFs has been a controversial and sensitive issue for Ward 6. Each of these factors underlies the need to improve the effectiveness of the ward’s human services delivery system c) District of Columbia General Hospital, the city’s only public health facility, provides medical and health education services for residents of Ward 6 and others throughout the District. The District of Columbia Genera] Hospital is the only city owned and operated acute care and emergency treatment hospital. It serves all city residents, regardless of their ability to pay for treatment. The hospital is governed by a board of directors and is administered by an executive director d) The 26-building complex has 1.5 million square feet of floor area. The hospital is part of a 65-acre tract that also includes Department of Human Services and Department of Corrections buildings. Constructed in the 1930s, the hospital was first renovated during the mid- 1960s e) CBRF’s are an important element of the human services delivery system. They provide housing for a number of individuals and families in need of various types of public assistance f) A new Forensic Treatment Facility is planned to be constructed at 19th and D Streets, S.E. The proposed treatment center and CBItFs have been the center of controversy throughout the ward. Residents have expressed concern that these facilities lower property value and pose threats to public safety g) Other problems in the ward include an increase in teenage pregnancies, infant mortality, and drug and alcohol abuse SEC. 1200.630. WARD 6 OBJECTIVES FOR HUMAN SERVICES The objectives for human services are as follows I) To provide effective physical and mental health care services throughout the ward 2) To improve public safety and increase the perception of safety in Ward 6 3) To continue to provide a comprehensive network of public and private health, social and economic services to meet the needs of residents in Ward 6 SEC. 1200.631.

WARD 6 ACTIONS TO IMPLEMENT THE PLAN: HUMAN SERVICES The actions to implement the human services objectives are as follows 1) Ensure that Congressionally-sponsored service institutions are compatible with the character of the immediately surrounding neighborhood 2) Retain and preserve Friendship House and Southeast House as neighborhood social services component 3) Develop joint public/private community human service center, including job information and placement and recreational facilities at an appropriate central H Street, N.E. site, as identified in re-evaulated H Street Corridor Urban Renewal Plan 4) Prevent further concentration of community-based residential facilities CBRF’s in Ward 6 neighborhoods and require future development of the CBI~F’s to be in accordance with the District-wide CBRF plan, except that efforts to prevent further concentration of community-based residential facilities shall not violate the Fair Housing Amendments Act, approved March 12, 1989 (102 Star. 1619; 42 U.S.C. 3601 et seq Fair Housing Act For the purposes of this paragraph, the term ’handicap’ has the same meaning as in section 802(h) of the Fair Housing Act (42 U.S.C. 3602(h 5) Develop senior citizen community center in northeast section of the ward 6) Support Boys/Girls Club at 17th Street/Massachusetts Avenue, S.E. and make more accessible to neighborhood 7) Relocate Capitol Hill Day Care Center from Massachusetts Avenue/2nd Street, N.E. corner to more appropriate new location 8) Maintain the "Therapeutic and Handicapped Center" at 3030 G Street, S.E. and the valuable human services it provides to the community 9) Improve police protection of Hope Village, a combined adult-offender drug rehabilitation facility in Woodland subarea SEC. 1200.633. WARD 6 LAND USE a) Ward 6 is characterized predominantly by moderate-density residential and low-to-moderate density commercial land use. Almost all commercial activity consists of small businesses supplying services to the surrounding community. Recently there has been reuse of many commercial buildings and the construction of new buildings to furnish offices for national associations and other groups servicing their needs. There is little developable vacant property. Most development opportunities are for infill structures, both commercial and residential b) Much of the ward’s distinctive physical character is bestowed by the existence of two large historic districts, which together occupy 40 percent of the ward’s land. The Capitol Hill Historic District is comprised of a large number of brick row houses and commercial 287 ENROLLEO ORIGINAL structures dating from 1850 to 1915. There are some 8,000 such buildings. This district is distinguished also by the LVEnfant street plan and an extensive alley system. Within the Capitol Hill Historic District residential uses are ahnost exclusively row houses with scattered small apartment houses. There also has been conversion of some schools and churches to condominiums. Under current zoning, each row house is entitled to be used for two units or flats. Most residents find that the right to live in one part of the house while permitting a rental unit in an English basement provides both sufficient density and the ability to support house payments. rr(c) Other concerns in protecting the integrity of the row houses in residential neighborhoods in Ward 6 are overly permissive definitions of home occupations which would permit the expansion of offices in the residential areas. Other concerns affecting the residential districts are the development of alley lots into multi-family housing at density levels that change the neighborhood and without regard to issues of light and air d) Similar, but more varied, conditions exist in the residential areas on the east side of the ward (east of the Anacostia River In the Anacostia Historic District there are some row houses but also numerous small, detached wooden structures. Interspersed are a number of 1950s apartment houses that are a discordant note to the uniformity of the historic district. There are also a series of neighborhoods such as Twining/Greenwood that are largely single-family detached but include a number of apartment houses which appear to have been permitted without appropriate consideration of the impact on the neighborhood. These neighborhoods require careful consideration of any additional non single-family usage in order to preserve and enhance these areas e) The commercial districts of the ward largely serve the surrounding residential neighborhood with some areas close to the Capitol serving a large daytime population. On the west end of the ward there is an urgent need that many portions of the commercial areas be closely studied to take into consideration the character and constraints of the Historic District and at the same time permit reasonable development. In this regard, some special attention has already been given through the Capital Interest Outlay Zone, which covers the historic district from the Capitol to 6th Street, S.E. and N.E. This restricts both uses and height of buildings. Much of the commercial district encompassed by that zone, including the 200 and 300 blocks of Pennsylvania Avenue, S.E. and Massachusetts Avenue up to the east end of Stanton Park, N.E. serve populations working in the Capitol and within the historic district ’urther out on Pennsylvania Avenue, S.E. there is a node of commercial activity focused on the Eastern Market Metro Stop and park. This includes the 600 block of Pennsylvania Avenue, 7th Street, S.E. from the Avenue to North Carolina Avenue, and includes Eastern Market and Pennsylvania Avenue down 8th Street, S.E. to the Navy Yard, a commercial area called Barracks Row f) From 9th Street on Pennsylvania Avenue to Barney Circle, there is an opportunity through careful planning and special streetscape to convert this portion of historic Pennsylvania Avenue into an attractive area which will attract substantial investment. Unfortunately, much of the land use is now devoted to service stations and fast-food restaurants. 288 ENROLLED ORIGINAL g) The H Street corridor is still rebuilding from the disturbances of 1968. However, there are a number of positive actions which are stimulating rebuilding. First, there is a long-standing Urban renewal Plan for the corridor which has been implemented through a number of D.C. government investments and land assemblages. Equally important to the street’s revitalization as in important shopping area has been the development of the Hechinger Mall which is still under expansion and is helping to stimulate development in the adjacent Benning 1~oad area. Another development of somewhat more upscale character is the development of Union Station and environs as a large shopping mall and office buildings. That is affecting development in the nearby H Street corridor. And the continuing revitalization of the Capitol Hill Historic District will help support even more business development along H Street, N.E h) On the east side of the ward, the major portion of the business district has been largely planned as a result of the efforts of the Anacostia Coordinating Committee ACC The plan has been accepted by the local ANC and public officials and needs the assistance of the appropriate District agencies to make it a reality. Not only is the ACC plan finished and ready for implementation but the Green Line Metro station on the Plan’s edge in Ward 8 is open and there is revitalization of the Anacostia Historic District within which sits the commercial area, which will also help support the implementation of the ACC plan i) Although the residential areas on the west side of the ward seem relatively stable, they are quite fragile because of density, traffic and crime. Therefore, in order to preserve and enhance these areas and to retain owner-occupants in these areas as well as to encourage stable family life, these issues need to be addressed. The continuing pressure for commercial and office use within these neighborhoods needs to be resisted. Because of the large number of under-utilized or empty schools in the west end of the ward, the School Board should be required to utilize these facilities for non-school use in conformance with the area’s predominant land use. Conversion of institutional buildings such as schools, warehouses, and churches for residential use a common practice in this area should be at a conforming density level j) A significant support to the stable residential neighborhoods is the availability of recreational spaces for both passive and active uses. In this regard, there is little large-scale space available on the west side of the ward. There are numerous small parks scattered throughout the area with a few benches and small children’s play apparatus, such as Turtle Park at the intersection of North Carolina Avenue, S.E. and Independence Avenue, S.E. Careful maintenance of these parks is important. Larger parks include Lincoln, Stanton, etc which are important green spaces but do not provide active recreation areas. Some of that is provided in school yards. But the major recreational park in the ward is the Anacostia l~iver and its accompanying river front park system k) Anacostia Park is under the jurisdiction of the Park Service and intended to be a regional facility. However, it also serves as the major recreational area for Ward 6. The recreational aspects of the park are particularly well developed on the east side with tennis courts, ball fields, picnic areas, fishing off the sea wall, a swimming pool and a structure to shelter outdoor entertainment. In addition, beyond the 289 ENROLLED ORIGINAL Conrail tracks north, there is an undeveloped area which has an abundance of wild life, including numerous varieties of birds. That portion needs maintenance and some greater accessibility which will come as part of the Barney Circle project, but retain its undeveloped character 1) West Anacostia Park lacks a coherent plan for use. It now contains a variety of non-park uses including the D.C. Stadium and its parking lots, D.C. general Hospital, the jail, a new prison, the Swirl facility for treating discharges into the Anacostia, Congressional Cemetery, and a proposed roadway off East Capitol Street and the bridge linkage to the Southeast Freeway. Despite these problems, planning for the Barney Circle Freeway provides for such amenities as a number of playing fields and turnoffs from the roadway to permit fuller use of the river banks. As the Anacostia becomes cleaner, it becomes more available for recreational use. Several school groups are now working on the development of rowing competitions and it can be used for sculling and canoeing. Larger boat clubs line the banks between the Pennsylvania Avenue bridge and the Navy Yard. The organization of the west bank of the Anacostia for boating activities of various types seems to be a trend and should be studied in order to have a compatible relationship among the various uses m) A significant change in Ward 6 will come in the Capitol South and Capitol Gateway areas. These areas now include industrial and warehouse uses, parking lots, vacant land and buildings, the WMATA bus garage and the Washington Post printing facility. Full redevelopment of the area will take twenty or more years. The Generalized Land Use Map calls for medium density commercial in Capitol South (north of M Street) and a combination of medium-high density commercial, high density residential and production and technical employment (PTE) categories in Capitol Gateway (south of M Street The development potential of Capitol South, as a prime commercial area, and Capitol Gateway, as a prime mixed use area, should be enhanced to provide areas where significant office growth and a balanced mix of residential and PTE uses are allowed and encouraged n) The development of the Northeast No. 1 and Eckington Yards Special Treatment Area will generate significant changes in Ward 6. This area now includes warehouse uses, parking lots, vacant land and buildings, and several new and renovated office buildings. Redevelopment of the area will take fifteen or more years. The redevelopment of the area north of Union Station as a primary and secondary commercial area should be enhanced and targeted as an area where office growth is allowed and encouraged SEC. 1200.634. WARD 6 OBJECTIVES FOR LAND USE The objectives for land use are as follows I) To maintain the genera] ]eve] of the existing Ward 6 residential uses, densities and heights, and to improve the physical condition of Ward 6 through the provision of functional, efficient and attractive residential, commercial and open space areas 2) To minimize conflicts between the various land uses in Ward 6 and to promote healthy residential environments through selective renewal, rehabilitation and neighborhood revitalization programs. 290 ENROLLED ORIGINAL 3) To locate the more intensive and active land uses in areas of Ward 6 that, by virtue of existing and planned infrastructures, can accommodate and support those types of uses and to monitor development and redevelopment adjacent to designated historic districts to ensure compatibility SEC. 1200.635. WARD 6 POLICIES IN SUPPORT OF LAND USE OBJECTIVES The policies in support of land use objectives are as follows 1) Stabilize and improve residential and commercial areas throughout Ward 6 2) Ensure that the integrity of the Capitol Hill and Anacostia Historic Districts that are located in Ward 6 is maintained 3) Monitor new developments to ensure that they are consistent with the moderate-density residential and low-to-moderate density commercial character of Ward Six 4) Reduce the incompatible land uses in residential areas and neighborhoods and enforce regulatory tools to reduce the potential change in the overall character of the Ward 6 area 5) Fully implement the regulations of the Capitol Interest Districts and work with the Architect of the Capitol to ensure that the development of federal buildings in the future is compatible with adjacent residential areas located in Ward 6 6) Development of Capitol South and Capitol Gateway, as part of the Buzzard Point/Near Southeast development area, should be in accordance with the commercial density designations in the Comprehensive Plan’s Land Use Element and Generalized Land Use Map. Residential development should be appropriately phased. An office and living environment should be created that offers a unique opportunity for mixed use office-residential development in the District 7) Redevelopment of the Ward 6 portion of the Northeast No.1/Eckington Yards Special Treatment Area should proceed as a primary and secondary commercial area. An appropriate but flexible office environment must be created that offers an opportunity and challenge to suburban and other office developers to locate and establish businesses in the District, and to serve as an overflow area for Downtown development SEC. 1200.636. WARD 6 ACTIONS TO IMPLEMENT THE PLAN: LAND USE The actions to implement the land use objectives are as follows 1) Ensure that development of sites designated to accommodate future expansion of U.S. Capitol grounds is compatible with character of residential neighborhoods 2) Restrict development of available non-residential lots in Square 693 to uses that support the residential character and Capitol vista of New Jersey Avenue 3) Limit development of the Providence Hospital site to its designated use as the prospective residential school for Congressional Pages or for a comparable use such as low- or medium-density residential or institutional use. Private development, if any, should be subject to long-term lease and conditioned on compatibility with residential area. Should otherwise and in the interim be maintained as open space. 291 ENROLLED ORIGINAl 4) Future use of former FDA building at 1st and E Streets, S.E. by the Architect of the Capitol to be compatible with adjacent residential community. Density of use should not be increased 5) Protect the existing alley system and develop policy and plans for use of large block interior spaces. These plans shall be developed in coordination with the affected ANC 6) Control development near Capitol South and Eastern Market Metro station areas to conform with existing and predominant uses and Ward 6 plan objectives and provisions.

Development of commercial lots on 1st Street, S.E. to conform with Capitol Interest District standards 7) Direct development of medium-density office space near the U.S. House of Representatives to underutilized sites south of the Southeast/Southwest Freeway, east of South Capitol Street 8) Prevent commercial development of Kingman Island (Children’s Island) to avoid adverse effects on neighborhoods; island and adjacent park areas to be improved for community and city-wide recreation use. It shall not be used for stadium or stadium-related purposes 9) Retain open-air Farmers’ Market at stadium 10) Designate area around Potomac Avenue Metro station as a Special Treatment Area. Boundaries of special study area are llth Street, S.E. on the west (including the llth Street commercial corridor D Street, S.E. on the north, Kentucky Avenue on the east and Southeast/Southwest Freeway on the south. Special Treatment Area study to include development of underutilized commercial sites e.g Bogan property at 14th and Potomac Avenue, S.E protection of residential properties and neighborhoods in the study area, including the residential neighborhood south of Pennsylvania Avenue bounded by 13th Street, S.E. on the west, Pennsylvania Avenue on the north, 15th Street, S.E. on the east, and the Southeast/Southwest Freeway on the south. Special Treatment analysis to emphasize economic development potential in balance with predominately residential character of area 11) Ensure that any plans for the WMATA Southeast Metrobus Garage site are integrated with the District’s plans for the Buzzard Point/Near Southeast area 12) Prevent prolification of fast-food outlets along commercial corridors, i.e Barney Circle, Union Station, Massachusetts Avenue, Pennsylvania Avenue, 7th and 8th Streets, S.E 13) Establish a special treatment area for the Capitol ttill central business district: Pennsylvania Avenue, S.E. from 6th Street to 4th Street, S.E 7th Street, S.E. between the freeway and North Carolina Avenue, S.E and 8th Street, S.E. from Pennsylvania Avenue to the Navy Yard 14) Select sites for increased FAR in commercial districts based on appropriate studies 15) Prepare comprehensive analysis of land use in Massachusetts Avenue, N.E. and Pennsylvania Avenue, S.E commercial corridor 16) Land use in area to be in accordance with Old Anacostia development concept plan. 292 ENROLLED ORIGINAL 17) Prepare detailed site development plan for North Entry to Anacostia Squares 5600 and 5601 18) Develop the area north of the llth Street Bridge at 14th Street and Ridge Place, S.E in a manner compatible with the historic district and surrounding residential neighborhoods 19) Develop program for density reduction and provision of amenities throughout Woodland neighborhood in balance with current and projected population.

Control development near Eastern Market Metro station to conform with existing predominant land uses and Ward 6 Plan objectives and provisions 21) Prevent the establishment of "gas-n-go" self service stations, service stations with 24-hour mini-marts or convenience stores throughout the ward, and support the continuation of existing full-service gas stations on Pennsylvania Avenue, S.E especially from the Capitol to Minnesota Avenue, S.E SEC. 1200.637. WARD 6 ACTIONS TO IMPLEMENT THE PLAN: OTHER CHANGES a) Limit the establishment or expansion of enclosed sidewalk cafes b) Provide incentives for small inns and "bed-and-breakfast" establishments in commercial areas and limit their proliferation in residential areas c) Develop and establish special land use categories to meet the unique characteristics of the Capitol Hill and Anacostia Historic Districts, particularly the commercial areas. Future residential development in the Anacostia Historic District should be limited to no greater than moderate density, and in the absence of a special land use designation providing otherwise, future commercial development should not exceed medium density. 293 ENROLLED ORIGINAL "SUBTITLE 7 "SEC. 1200.700 "SEC. 1200.700.1 "SEC. 1200.700.2 "SEC. 1200.700.3 "SEC. 1200.700.4 "SEC. 1200.700.5 "SEC. 1200.701 "SEC. 1200.702 "SEC. 1200.703 "SEC. 1200.704 "SEC. 1200.705 "SEC. 1200.706 "SEC. 1200.707 "SEC. 1200.708 "SEC. 1200.709 "SEC. 1200.710 "SEC. 1200.711 "SEC. 1200.712 "SEC. 1200.713 "SEC. 1200.714 "SEC. 1200.715 "SEC. 1200.716 "SEC. 1200.717 "SEC. 1200.718 "SEC. 1200.719 "SEC. 1200.720 "SEC. 1200.721 "SEC. 1200.722 "SEC. 1200.723 "SEC. 1200.724 "SEC. 1200.725 "SEC. 1200.726 "SEC. 1200.727 "WARD 7 PLAN "TABLE OF CONTENTS WARD 7 PLAN INTRODUCTION VISION FOR WARD 7 WARD 7 PLANNING FOCUS WARD 7 HISTORY WARD 7 TODAY WARD 7 ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT WARD 7 OBJECTIVES FOR ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT WARD 7 ACTIONS IN SUPPORT OF ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT WARD 7 HOUSING WARD 7 OBJECTIVES FOR HOUSING WARD 7 ACTIONS IN SUPPORT OF HOUSING WARD 7 ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION WARD 7 OBJECTIVES FOR ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION WARD 7 ACTIONS IN SUPPORT OF ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION WARD 7 TRANSPORTATION WARD 7 OBJECTIVES FOR TRANSPORTATION WARD 7 ACTIONS IN SUPPORT OF TRANSPORTATION WARD 7 PUBLIC FACILITIES WARD 7 OBJECTIVES FOR PUBLIC FACILITIES WARD 7 ACTIONS IN SUPPORT OF PUBLIC FACILITI ES WARD 7 URBAN DESIGN WARD 7 OBJECTIVES FOR URBAN DESIGN WARD 7 ACTIONS IN SUPPORT OF URBAN DESIGN WARD 7 PRESERVATION AND HISTORIC FEATURES WARD 7 OBJECTIVES FOR PRESERVATION AND HISTORIC FEATURES WARD 7 ACTIONS IN SUPPORT OF PRESERVATION AND HISTORIC FEATURES WARD 7 HUMAN SERVICES WARD 7 OBJECTIVES FOR HUMAN SERVICES WARD 7 ACTIONS IN SUPPORT OF HUMAN SERVICES WARD 7 LAND USE/ZONING WARD 7 OBJECTIVES FOR LAND USE/ZONING WARD 7 ACTIONS IN SUPPORT OF LAND USE/ZONING 294 ENROLLED ORIGINAL "SEC. 1200.700.1 WARD 7 PLAN INTRODUCTION "SEC. 1200.700.2 VISION FOR WARD 7 a) This Plan is based on a vision for the future of Ward 7 over the next five years as set forth by the ward’s communities. Although Ward 7 is primarily a stable, residential neighborhood, city officials and ward residents envision a number of changes relative to economic development and environmental protection. This vision underscores the preservation protection and enhancement of the ward’s many stable residential neighborhoods, its neighborhood serving shopping centers, and its many parks, open spaces and natural resources b) The vision for Ward 7 is of a stable area where residents remain because of the solid neighborhoods and park-like qualities that make it a desired community in which to live, shop and work. Neighborhoods like Fairfax Village, Dupont Park, Hillcrest and Deanwood have a strong sense of community and visual identity. This plan envisions neighborhoods like Eastland Gardens and Parkside as containing a greater range of housing options. These options would include refurbished public housing and new and remodeled privately-owned single and multi-family housing designed for a wide-range of life styles (such as first-time homeowners and senior citizens One can also envision the River Terrace community where the Anacostia River Park serves as a national park of special riverside and scenic quality and character c) Overall, Ward 7’s communities will be protected from water and air pollution, noise, litter, and congestion caused by nonresidential uses. Places of historical significance, gateways, parks and open spaces will continue to provide an attractive setting and quiet refuge for daily living d) This plan envisions the Fort Circle Parks System which runs the entire length of the ward offering additional cultural and community-oriented recreational opportunities such as picnics, indoor ice skating and the l~ort Dupont Amphitheater summer concert series. Well delineated trails and park connections throughout also offer a variety of passive and active recreation opportunities for residents e) Activities like the "Minnesota Avenue Day" celebration and complementing visitor attractions such as the Kenilworth Aquatic Gardens and the Kenilworth Park and Community Center provide special programs for the youth and elderly residents that will help build community spirit f) In the vision, the ward’s neighborhoods will be well-served by improved commercial and industrial centers, employment centers, and a transportation network to meet the needs of residents, businesses and property owners. Neighborhood-serving commercial areas already have a strong presence in the ward. The Comprehensive Plan designates the Minnesota Avenue and Benning Road area as a regional commercial center which serves all the neighborhoods of Ward 7 and parts of abutting Prince Georges County. As the overall economy improves, this area, which contains the East River Park and Senator Square Shopping Centers, should be developed and upgraded in connection with appropriate urban planning concepts to yield a greater variety of retail commercial shops, sufficient parking spaces, adequate lighting and facade and street improvements g) With the re-emergence of the economy, the vision includes market feasibility studies and initial implementation measures to encourage the location of essential community serving commercial uses such as drug 295 ENROLLED ORIGINAL and hardware stores, a branch department store, theaters, hotels and full service sit down restaurants. It is possible to envision the orderly development of Deanwood, Minnesota Avenue and the Benning l~oad Metrorail sites. Appropriate zoning and careful joint development could serve as an impetus for vital business activity which offers services that are in tune with the interest of both residential communities and the neighborhood retail centers h) The ward plan envisions that there will be significant improvement to the physical infrastructure and general functioning of the transportation system. This will be necessary to meet the diverse needs of residents, workers and visitors, especially the elderly and the physically and mentally handicapped l) Rerouting bus services to include additional trips to the southeast portion of the ward will be necessary to access the new Anacostia Metrorail station on the Green Line. Also, improved bicycle routes will offer safe and convenient travel alternatives j) The vision also includes provisions to preserve and enhance the "park-like" setting of the streets and areas near the ward’s natural park sites, l~educing crime, ensuring a clean environment and providing new and rehabilitated housing in appropriate locations near Metrorail stations will attract a diverse population to the ward. There will be attractive, better serviced and more secured neighborhoods bolstered by stronger feelings of community involvement and pride among all residents of Ward 7 SEC. 1200.700.3 AI~D 7 PLANNING FOCUS "The focus of the Nard 7 Plan is to 1) propose a development pattern for Ward 7 which will be consistent with the Comprehensive Plan for the National Capital D.C. Laws 5-76, 5-187 and 8-129 2) provide the framework for small area plans by identifying areas in the ward where more detailed planning is required 3) provide the basis for making specific decisions on the allocation of District resources to community development and economic development projects 4) consider the economic impact on the ward by the Metro Orange and Blue lines at the Minnesota Avenue, Deanwood and Benning Road stations in the formulation of land use and density recommendations 5) emphasize the importance of preserving, enhancing and protecting established residential areas from encroachment by incompatible uses 6) recognize the need to retain the general housing stock with an emphasis on retaining an adequate supply of low- and moderate-income residential units 7) recognize the need to preserve and enhance an appropriate range and density of land uses in order to maintain the integrity of neighborhoods 8) provide for the retention and enhancement of public spaces, parks and public facilities within the ward 9) support more efficient use of both public and private transportation services throughout the ward 10) detail locations where the conservation of stable areas and land uses should be encouraged; and 296 EHROLLEO ORIGIHAL 11) provide a framework for preserving and enhancing the natural environment SEC. 1200.700.4 WARD 7 HISTORY a) The first inhabitants of the Ward 7 area were the Nacotchtank Indians. There is evidence that 16 known Indian sites existed along the Potomak, later called Potomac, and the Anna Kastia, which became known as the Eastern Branch of the Potomac, and finally, Anacostia, rivers. It had been recorded that Captain John Smith, founder of Jamestown, visited the area in 1608 while on an exploring expedition from the Jamestown settlement in Virginia. He gave the waterway the name Nacostine, great town for traders. The Jesuits later changed the name to the Latin Anacostia. The Nacotchtanks were an agricultural people who preferred the flatlands along the two rivers as opposed to the high inland bluffs. Some 60 years after they came into contact with Europeans, the Indians disappeared from the banks of the Eastern Branch b) The Ward 7 area was originally a part of Maryland’s Prince Georges County. It was part of a 1632 land grant from Englandts Charles I to George Calvert, the first Lord Baltimore c) In later years, various land grants were given by Lord Baltimore to wealthy and influential Englishmen. These large tracts were later subdivided. By the time Washington, the District of Columbia, had become a federal city in 1800, some building had begun in the area. Most of the land to the east was still countryside until the 1900s with the onset of World War II d) Among the earliest settlements on this side of the river by the time of the Civil War was the little crossroads community of Good Hope. This area, developed in the 1820s on the hilltop at the intersection of Naylor Road and Alabama Avenue, was popular with early settlers and weary travelers. Its businesses included wagon repair shops and horse stables. Also, Uniontown, a speculative development laid out at the end of the Navy Yard Bridge in 1854, and Barry~s Farm, were created nearby in Ward 8 by the Freedmen~s Bureau in 1867. These are the oldest neighborhoods east of the Anacostia River e) Another early settlement was Benning Heights near Fort Dupont in far-Southeast Washington. The name of the community is that of early nineteenth century landowner William Benning, who helped finance the wooden bridge built in 1797 by the Anacostia Bridge Company on the site of the present-day Benning Road Bridge. Two notable historic features in the area are the Fort Dupont Park and the Woodlawn Cemetery on Benning Road. The 400-acre Fort Dupont Park on the community’s western boundary is second only to Rock Creek Park in size. It is the site of one of 68 Civil War forts that provided a protective ring around the District of Columbia f) In 1895, 23 acres of land in the area were purchased from John and Mary Schultz for Woodlawn Cemetery. At that time, very few cemeteries would accept black burials, and Woodlawn was created in the countryside to meet this need. The Woodlawn Cemetery is more than 100 years old and is the burial site for many locally and nationally famous Black people. Among those buried there are U.S. Senator Blanche K. Bruce, and a son of Fredrick Douglass. Senator Bruce rose from slavery 297 F..NROI, LED ORIGINAL to become the first Black senator to serve a full term (1875-1881 Also buried there is John Mercer Langston, Virginiats first Black congressman g) The cemetery and the remains of Fort Dupont stood isolated in the midst of woodland and fields. It was not until the 1920s that the first land development came to the large open areas of far-Southeast. The first major developments were along Alabama and Pennsylvania avenues; they include, the Parklands Apartment, off Alabama Avenue in the Garfield Section, and Fairfax Village, bounded by Suitland l~oad and Southern, Pennsylvania, and Alabama avenues. The first streets of Benning Heights appeared in 1927, but only about 25 structures had been built. By 1936 there were still only about 50 structures on the streets of Benning Heights. The Benning Heights community finally filled out in the 1940s, as a result of new government jobs created by World War II h) Within about a decade of the construction of most of its houses, Benning Heights underwent a dramatic population shift, as racial barriers began to fall. In 1948, the Supreme Court ruled that restrictive housing covenants like those governing the first sale of Benning Heights houses were unconstitutional. In 1956 the change began to occur, and by 1960 the neighborhood had become almost a totally black community i) After the Civil War ended, freed Blacks began to move northeast into the still largely unsettled Ward 7 area. Among the new settlements were DePriest Village (Capital View Burrville, Bloomingdale and Lincoln. Among these new settlements, the Deanwood area was known for its self-reliance. The Benning-Sheriff-Lowrie-Dean and Fowler farms, both carved from Ninian BeallWs 1703 land grant, undergird Deanwood~s history. Tucked just inside the cityts eastern border, the triangular area is bounded by Eastern Avenue on the northeast, Kenilworth Avenue on the northwest, and East Capitol Street on the south j) Today, Deanwood is a solidly black community. It was born, however, when three white women, the daughters of Levi Sheriff, divided part of the farm they had inherited from their father. In 1871, the Southern Maryland Kailroad Company laid its tracks close to the Old Bladensburg-Piscataway Road and built a station near the Sheriff farm. Margaret Lowrie, Emmeline Sheriff, and Mary Cornelia Dean immediately initiated three subdivisions. Whittingham, a triangular parcel, was bounded by railroad tracks on the west, Sheriff Koad on the south, and present-day 45th Street on the east. A subdivision named Lincoln (today known as Lincoln Heights apparently meant from the outset to be black owned, was platted near the farm’s south edge. Burrville, just east of the ridge, completed the trio. These subdivisions were all loosely tied by the name Deanwood k) By 1880, a handful of non-farmers lived in what would become Deanwood. Deanwood grew slowly throughout this period. By 1893, a few houses dotted each subdivision and the lots along Sheriff Road 1} By 1909, Deanwoodts black community was large enough to require its own public school. A city architect, Snowden Ashford, designed Deanwood Elementary School, now George Washington Carver School. Another educational institution came to Deanwood in 1909, when the National Trade and Professional School for Women and Girls opened in the Lincoln section. Nannie Helen Burroughs, a black woman born in Virginia and educated in Washington, founded the school on behalf of the 298 ENROI.LEI) ORIGINAL National Baptist Convention. The school has survived dramatic social changes and continues today as Nannie Helen Burroughs School m) By 1910, Deanwood had a stable nucleus of blue and white collar black families with a network of laborers and skilled craftsmen working in the building trades. Black members of this pool passed their skills on to family members or to their black neighbors. They also helped one another locate jobs, build their own houses or additions to them, and make repairs. This network enhanced the strong sense of economic independence and self-reliance of Deanwood’s Black community. ’~(n) Two black Deanwood brothers, Jacob and Randolph Dodd, built more than 50 houses between 1921 and 1930. Some of Washington’s black architects who designed buildings for Deanwood include Lewis Giles, St; H.D. Woodson; and George A ’erguson T’(o) Some of the early settler’s descendants are still in the area. They include the Bells, Jones, Hawkins, Woodsons (for which the public high school is named Stewarts (of the Stewarts ~’uneral Home) and the Chapmans. Emily Miner, founder of Miner Teachers College, also was a Ward 7 resident. Miner Teachers College later became D.C. Teachers College, now part of the University of the District of Columbia p) Its distance from the central city kept Deanwood a semirural area until after World War II. It was not until the 1950s that the city government provided services taken for granted in other areas such as paved streets, sewers, and some sidewalks. Certain portions of the ward developed slowly. Even as late as 1927, there were only two houses in Marshall Heights. By the later 1930s, development in the area was well underway q) Among the developing neighborhoods was Summit Park, now called Hillcrest. Its streets, such as Austin, Bangor and Camden, had been laid out and it had about 500 residents. Bradbury Heights (Benning Ridge) had about 2,000 residents. About one-fourth of its area was served by the city’s sewer system. A controversial issue in the area was a proposal for low cost housing at Ridge Road in the Anacostia area. Despite some opposition, the complex was built during the early 1940s. Garden Greenway and Central Northeast areas, and most recently along Benning Road. Single-family, detached units continue to be built. However, town houses, duplexes, triplexes, and garden apartments have dominated the area’s residential development since 1950 SEC. 1200.700.5 WARD 7 TODAY a) Existing Land Use Patterns 1) Located in the far northeast/southeast section of the city, Ward 7 is generally bounded by Eastern Avenue on the north, Southern Avenue on the east, the Anacostia River and Minnesota Avenue on the west and M Place, 25th Street and Naylor Road on the south. Ward 7 is part of the District’s eastern boundary to Prince Georges County, Maryland, and is separated from the central and western sections of the city by the Anacostia River 2) Ward 7 is largely residential, supported by shopping areas, churches, schools, recreational facilities, and a large amount of National Park Service land that serves the city and the region in some cases. The ward has more land devoted to residential use than most wards, and more than the citywide proportion of 25.6 percent. Single family detached and semi-detached housing accounts for the largest 299 ENROLLED ORIGINAL portion of the residential acreage and is distributed throughout most areas of the ward 3) This ward is known for its vast open space. Parks include Anacostia Park and Kenilworth Aquatic Gardens along the Anacostia River shoreline; Watts Branch Parkway running across the northeast section of Ward 7; and Fort Circle Parks, a linear system which connects a ring of Civil War forts and numerous parks throughout the ward. Many of these parks contain active recreational facilities, including a number of Department of Recreation (DOR) centers. Public uses include schools, police and fire stations and government buildings 4) The ward is generally well-supported with adequate roads, mass-transit and rail-freighted access to the rest of the city and the region. Interstate 295, which runs parallel to Kenilworth Avenue, bisects the ward from northeast to southwest. Two Metrorail routes with three stations assure that well over half of the ward population has convenient access to the Metrorail system b) Neighborhoods 1) Ward 7 can be characterized as a predominantly residential area. It encompasses 3,500 acres of land excluding public rights-of-way. Residential land use covers 1,500 acres, which is 43 percent of the Ward 7 area. The residents of the ward are as diverse as their neighborhoods. The population is predominantly black and relatively young. Incomes range from the upper income level to the below poverty level 2) The residential neighborhoods of Deanwood, Lincoln Heights, Grant Park, Fort Dupont Park, Greenway, Capital View, Benning Heights and Marshall Heights, by and large, contain large concentrations of multi-family and public assisted housing. The ten public housing developments within the ward constitute 23 percent of all the public and assisted housing in the city 3) South of Fort Dupont Park to Pennsylvania Avenue are the Fort Dupont Park and Twinning Neighborhoods. The southern part of the ward includes l~andle Highland, and Good Hope. Fairfax Village, Hillcrest and Naylor Gardens are all south of Pennsylvania Avenue. These areas, along with Eastland Gardens, are dominated by middle to upper income single family detached and semi-detached houses 4) Detached units with an average lot size of 5,000 square feet, and semi-detached units, with average lots of 2,500 feet per unit, are most common in the Hillcrest, Good Hope, Penn Branch, Dupont Park, Benning Heights, Deanwood, Burrville, and Eastland Gardens neighborhoods 5) l~ow houses occupy approximately 2 percent of the ward’s land area, with an average lot size of 1,000 square feet per unit. They are predominant in River Terrace, Fort Davis, Eastland Gardens north of Douglas Street, and in Greenway along both sides of East Capitol Street. Row houses are also scattered throughout the ward in small clusters 6) Flats, walk-up apartments, condominiums and cooperative apartment buildings cover a combined total of approximately 11 percent of the Ward 7 land area. Most of the housing in the Mayfair, Fairfax Village, Naylor Gardens, and Greenway neighborhoods consists of flats and apartment buildings. 300 ENROLLED ORIGINAL 7) Multi-family structures also are found in Randle Highlands east of Minnesota Avenue, in Woodland along Naylor Road, and in the central ward areas along both sides of Banning l~oad. Two high-rise apartment buildings are located in Marshall Heights along East Capitol Street c) Commercial Areas/Nodal Development 1) The intersection of Minnesota Avenue and Banning Road is the largest commercial area in the ward and bisects the River Terrace and Central Northeast neighborhoods 2) The regional commercial center contains two major shopping centers, a post office, Giant and Safeway grocery stores and a variety of retail and commercial business. Large grocery stores are often "anchors" around which the businesses develop. Combined, these shopping centers offer a wide range of goods and one-stop shopping convenience 3) Additional commercial activities are included in the Skyland shopping center on Alabama Avenue and Naylor Road. This multi-neighborhood serving commercial area ranks second among those in the ward. Skyland contains Safeway and Giant grocery stores, a Peoples Drug Store, post office, Erols Video, several fast food restaurants, gasoline station, a Sears department store and several small retail commercial businesses. Other large business centers are located along Pennsylvania Avenue, particularly at the intersection of Pennsylvania and Branch avenues 4) Commercial activities include neighborhood shopping centers on major thoroughfares and a variety of spot commercial sites in the neighborhood. Strip commercial development is located along Banning Road, with a particularly dense cluster at East Capitol Street around the Banning Road Metrorail Station. Other small commercial areas are located on Nannie Helen Burroughs and Division avenues, 61st and Dix streets N.E. and the 3400 block of Banning Road N.E. within the River Terrace community 5) Most industrial uses are in a strip along the B&amp;amp;O Railroad/Addison Road Metro line, north of Nannie Helen Burroughs Avenue. This triangular shaped strip is known as the Kenilworth Industrial Park. The uses in the industrial park include warehouses, storage, automotive, shipping and Metro facilities. Heavy truck traffic and storage yards are characteristic of this area. Another industrial area is the PEPCO electric power generating plant along the Anacostia River shoreline north of Banning Road. The industrial development provides only limited employment opportunities. Job opportunities would increase with better quality industrial development and the upgrading of industrial USeS 6) The Minnesota Avenue, Banning Road and Deanwood Metro stations are potential development areas that can accommodate mixed uses, residential or commercial development. Minnesota Avenue/Banning Road, a primary commercial area in the ward, contains a mix of retail, office and residential uses d) Current Development Activity 1) Barman Property Proposed Subdivision. This is a 17.3-acre proposed subdivision at the 3700 block of Southern Avenue, S.E. in Prince Georges County.

The Burroughs Professional Building will be a medical office building, serving the medical needs of Ward 7 e) Demographic Characteristics 1) Population. 304 ENROLLED ORIGINAL A) Ward 7 had a population of about 72,900 in 1990. This is a decrease of 13,200, or about 15 percent, during the period 1980-1990. During the same period, the city’s population declined by five percent. In 1990, black and other races comprised 98 percent of the ward’s population, compared with about 73 percent citywide B) Ward 7 has a relatively young population. Twenty-two percent of its population was under 15 years of age in 1990. The citywide figure was 17 percent. The percentage of elderly persons in the ward is lower than the citywide figure. Thirteen percent of the ward population was 65 years of age or older in 1990, the same percentage for the city 2) Housing A) The number of households in the ward in 1990 was 28,800. A household is equivalent to an occupied housing unit. This was a decrease of 2,800 or about nine percent, from the 1980 figure of 31,600. This ran far below to the citywide trend, which had about a two percent decrease in the number of households. The mean household size in Ward 7 decreased from 2.7 to 2.5 persons between 1980 and 1990 B) In 1990, 40 percent of the households in the ward owned their own homes. The citywide figure was 39 percent. Forty-five percent of the ward’s households lived in one-unit structures in 1990, which was seven percentage points higher than the citywide figure. Only two percent of the ward’s households lived in structures of 50 or more units. This was quite small compared with the citywide figure of 22 percent C) Residential real estate values in Ward 7 are quite low compared with citywide figures. In 1987 the median sales price of row, semi-detached and detached houses in the ward was $63,000. This was 43 percent lower than the median value of $111,000 for the city. The median sales price of condominiums in the ward was $46,000 or 41 percent lower than the city median of $78,000 D) The increase in residential real estate prices in Ward 7 was substantially lower than that of the city. From 1980 to 1987, the prices of row, semi-detached and detached houses increased by 54 percent in the city, but by only 35 percent in the ward 3) Income A) The median household income for Ward 7 in 1989 was $25,600. This was about 20 percent lower than the citywide figure of $30,700 B) An examination of the proportion of households in the extreme ends of the income range is also useful for comparing Ward 7 with the city. In 1990, 20 percent of the ward’s households had incomes under $10,000, compared to 17 percent of the city. On the other end of the income scale, only six percent of the ward’s households had incomes of $50,000 or above, while the figure for the city was 28 percent C) In 1989, 18 percent of the households in Ward 7 or 5,200 households were below the poverty level, which is 1,100 less than the ward’s rate of 6,300 in 1979. The Census Bureau defines poverty as an annual income of $7,200 or less for a family of four. The percentage of households below the poverty level citywide was lower than the ward’s rate in both years. In addition, from 1979 to 1990, the city’s rate dropped two percentage points, from 17 percent to 15 percent. 305 ENROLLED ORIGINAL D) In 1990, 8,700 persons, representing 12 percent of Ward 7 population, received Food Stamps and 8,000 persons, or 11 percent of the ward’s population, received Aid to Families with Dependent Children (AFDC The citywide percentages were a few points lower, eight percent and seven percent, respectively 4) Education A) Educational attainment is usually an indicator of the general social and economic conditions within a community. A higher level of education is usually associated with a higher level of income B) Ten percent of those in Ward 7 in the 1980 census had completed only an eighth grade education and 31 percent completed high school, but did not continue their education further. Twelve percent completed four or more years of college. This rate of college completion is below the citywide rate of 33 percent 5) Employment A) According to the 1980 census, 38,200 persons in Ward 7 were eligible for the workforce with 34,500 actually employed. The unemployment rate for the ward was 9.7 percent, which was 2.4 percent higher than the city average of 7.3 percent. ’(B) Based on 1990 census for the ward, the total number of persons eligible for the work force was 35,106, with 32,032 actually employed. The unemployment rate for the ward was 8.2 percent, and for the city 7.0 percent. Ward 7 had an unemployment rate in 1990 that is 1.2 percentage points higher than the city average SEC. 1200.701 WARD 7 ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT a) Economic development means jobs, increased revenues to the city, new businesses and additional services to city residents b) The overall economic development objective for Ward 7 is to develop and implement strategies that both expand and generate new and productive uses for currently underused retail, commercial and industrial properties, thereby creating job opportunities and providing greater retail services for ward residents c) The Ward 7 plan addresses economic development issues effecting all aspects of the ward’s economy. The Minnesota-Benning Commercial Corridor serves as the regional center for Ward 7 and contains the Senator Square and East l~iver Park shopping centers. The Senator Square shopping center has plans underway for a total reconfiguration and upgrading of its property to allow for new commercial/retail services and an improved parking facility. The East ]~iver Park center has undergone extensive rehabilitation of the existing commercial spaces. There are additional plans for future development of the remaining vacant lots d) The plan calls for: revitalizing business activities along nodal and commercial areas such as the intersections of Nannie Helen Burroughs and Division avenues N.E 61st and Dix streets N.E. and the 3400 Block of Benning l~oad, N.E increasing the productivity and use of industrially zoned areas particularly along Kenilworth Avenue; realizing the full economic potential of Metrorail stations areas; and redeveloping retail/commercial centers to effectively serve the needs of ward neighborhoods e) There are three metro stations within the Ward 7 boundaries. They are the Deanwood, Bennlng l~oad and Minnesota Avenue stations. 306 ENROLLED ORIGINAL T~e areas surrounding these stations are prime areas for economic de[celopment; however, they have yet to realize their full economic potential. Efforts to develop the area around Metro Stations will require th~ appropriate mix, scale and intensity of development to ensure optimum utilization. The Washington Metropolitan Transit Authority (WMATA) is so:iciting proposals for a joint development opportunity at the Minnesota A enue Metrorail station f) The plan further highlights the need for services and programs th ~t strengthen the occupational skills of the ward’s labor force enabling thrum to compete effectively in the region’s job market. Access to the region’s job opportunities is an importantprerequisite to meeting the employment needs of less skilled workers. The Metrorail lines provide cr~cial access to employment opportunities in the ward, other District co~nmunities and in outlying suburban employment centers. Expanding th~ number of labor-intensive industries that employ semi-skilled workers is another economic development priority for Ward 7 residents g) In 1986, the city created three East of the River Development Zoaes (Anacostia, Alabama Avenue and D.C. Village A small portion of the areas within these zones lie within the borders of Ward 7 (Skyland Shopping Center The intent of the development zones is to stimulate ec~)nomic development by offering incentives to developers, first-time hone buyers and employers who provide jobs and job training to zone re idents h) In order to accomplish the objectives of the Development Zones Initiative, the District Council enacted legislation Economic Development Zo:]e Incentives Amendment Act of 1988, D.C. Law 7-177 The regulations for tax incentives appeared in the District of Columbia Mt~nicipal Regulations on June 12, 1992. u i The city, through the Development zones initiative, is focusing its,resources on helping Ward 7 minority-owned and small businesses, anq community-based development organizations. This comprehensive effort is based on the realization that the ward’s black and other mi ority- owned businesses face special problems, ranging from uncler-capitalization and insufficient marketing/management skills to the lack of control over the space which most of them occupy as renters. OILED will have the leading role in providing financial and technical as:~istance to the ward’s business and development organizations SEC. 1200.702 WARD 7 OBJECTIVES FOR ECONOMIC DI VELOPMENT "The objectives for economic development are 1) Focus and give priority development attention to the D~ anwood, Minnesota Avenue and Benning l~oad Metrorail station areas 2) Strengthen and enhance the economic stability of all e~ sting neighborhood commercial centers in the ward 3} Strengthen programs to retain small and minority bu ~inesses 4) Encourage and promote the development of active and effective Community Development Corporations (CDCs) and similar neighborhood-based economic development groups and to integrate these groups into the District’s overall planning and implementation of economic development, with emphasis on areas east of the Anacostia River. 307 ENROLLEO ORIGINAL 5) Support the appropriate development of the Minnesota Avenue Metrorail area, the River Terrace area, the Skyline shopping center area, the Nannie Helen Burroughs and Division avenues area, the 61st and Dix streets area and other existing neighborhood commercial areas 6) Ensure that economic development activity is sensitive to and compatible with its immediate environment 7) Control and minimize the impacts of nonresidential development on adjacent residential neighborhoods 8) Create and expand economic activity and employment centers in targeted areas (for example, the Minnesota/Benning Joint Development site and the Benning l~oad and Deanwood Metrorail station areas 9) Maximize the leverage potential of public funds to produce private sector investment in Ward 7 10) Attract labor-intensive industries which will employ, in significant proportions, Ward 7 residents 11) Enact programs and policies to ensure the availability of financial assistance and tax credits to community organizations and employers that start child care facilities in areas of greatest need SEC. 1200.703 WARD 7 ACTIONS IN SUPPORT OF ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT "The policies in support of economic development are as follows 1) Encourage and promote the revitalization and economic vitality of the Senator Square Shopping Center A) Senator Square needs to be revitalized to improve the availability of services, merchandise and employment opportunities.

There are a variety of housing types within the ward, consisting of single family detached and semi-detached homes, row houses and multi-family units, and owner-occupied and rental units. It has some of the finest neighborhoods with quality housing in the city. Fort Davis, Fairfax Village, Hillcrest, Naylor Gardens, Randle Highlands and Dupont Park are examples. Still, there are areas like Deanwood, Northwest Boundary and Benning Heights where housing and other neighborhood services must be improved. VW(b) Some neighborhoods within the ward have been classified by the DistricCs housing agency as "distressed In distressed neighborhoods, residents require considerable assistance because of low incomes and poor housing conditions. Many of the areas cited have a concentration of publicly assisted housing, residential structures in need of significant improvement and housing that is under rehabilitation c) The overall housing objective in Ward 7 is to stimulate development of new and rehabilitated housing at affordable rates to meet the needs of all income levels, particularly good housing at affordable rates for low and moderate incomes. The city through appropriate public actions will need to provide the stimulus and support to private activity in order to meet the current and future needs for market rate housing. 310 ENROLLED ORIGINAL At the same time, public resources should be targeted to assist those not able to afford decent, safe and sanitary housing d) Increased homeownership opportunities, such as the program instituted at Kenilworth/Parkside, are important to the ward and the city. There is a need to improve the condition of the existing housing stock to stop further deterioration of neighborhoods with households of moderate income and with above average homeownership levels. This could be accomplished through the availability of expanded housing programs e) Ward 7 has five Housing Opportunity Areas. These are areas where the District expects and encourages major new housing developments and rehabilitated housing. Many of the ward’s Housing Opportunity Areas contain public housing projects. The conversion of existing nonresidential buildings to housing and the return of vacant units to the ward’s housing supply are two additional means of producing more housing units SEC. 1200.705 WARD 7 OBJECTIVES FOR HOUSING "The objectives for housing are 1) Encourage the maintenance of homes that are in good condition and encourage the rehabilitation of housing units in disrepair 2) Stimulate the production of new and rehabilitated housing to meet all levels of need and to provide incentives for all types of housing at desired locations. ’ 3 Provide for the housing needs of low- and moderate-income households, to improve the District’s Low Rent Housing Program, to encourage ownership and to reduce the overall cost of housing for low- and moderate-income households in the ward 4) Provide loans and grants to encourage homeownership for low- and moderate-income renters in Ward 7 5) Continue to rehabilitate and improve Ward 7’s public and assisted housing units 6) Improve overall management of the ward’s public housing programs 7) Provide for the housing needs of the elderly and to reduce their overall housing costs 8) Provide regulatory, enforcement and financial programs to protect, maintain and enhance Ward 7’s housing supply and strengthen private and public neighborhood services and facilities that support the ward’s housing stock 9) Control the conversion of residential housing to nonresidential and transient uses SEC. 1200.706 WAleD 7 ACTIONS IN SUPPORT OF HOUSING "The policies in support of housing are as follows 1) Conduct a survey of land uses and zoning in Ward 7 to identify areas of conflict and to recommend appropriate zoning action A) Zoning changes may be needed in areas that are zoned P~-5-A (low density apartments) but have single-family detached and semi-detached dwellings.

New single-family housing built in Ward 8 will include small clusters of detached and semi-detached units at several sites c) Improvements in the availability of housing, retail services, employment, transportation, public services and community facilities will have an impact on the problems of drug abuse and drug-related crimes in the ward, even in areas where street drug activity is presently high d) The city’s anti-drug efforts, including enforcement, treatment and prevention programs, will reduce the crime rate, particularly illicit drug trafficking and homicides. In addition, a number of community service and religious groups, in cooperation with the District, will have in place comprehensive adult remedial education and vocational training programs and special rehabilitation facilities for underskilled former drug pushers, drug users and ex-offenders e) Finally, the number and proportion of Ward 8 residents on public assistance will be greatly reduced. More job and venture opportunities will be opening up not only in the ward but elsewhere in the local area. These opportunities, along with the physical transformation of the ward, will convince many young (and not so young) Ward 8 residents that there are viable alternatives to teenage pregnancy, drug-culture entrepreneurship and other self- and community-destroying activities. Nard 8 will become a safe place in which to walk the streets after dark and an ideal environment in which to live f) The focus of the Ward 8 Plan is to 1) Give priority to the protection, rehabilitation and improvement of neighborhoods through code enforcement and neighborhood preservation programs 2) Give priority to upgrading existing public services and facilities 3) Suggest ways of using public investments in the maintenance and location of capital improvements to stimulate privately funded renovation of existing residential, commercial and industrial properties 4) Capitalize on the Anacostia Metro Station area as a focal point of commercial, office and community/cultural activities 5) Encourage the provision of new job opportunities and the effective use of commercial land 6) Encourage the development of new commercial and employment areas that are compatible in design and scale with adjoining land uses, particularly residential neighborhoods. 340 ENROLLED ORIGINAL 7) Emphasize those measures that contribute to an orderly process of neighborhood revitalization 8) Suggest ways to increase the currently low level of home ownership in Ward 8 9) Emphasize nodal development of neighborhood commercial/retail service centers, including appropriate sites and height and design controls, over the extension of existing strip commercial areas SEC. 1200.800.4 WARD 8 HISTORY a) The area that comprises Ward 8 has one of the most interesting histories of settlement in the District of Columbia. Although this ward is the youngest in the District in terms of urban settlement trends, its tradition as a place of human settlement dates back some 2.,000 years to the initial establishment of Native American trading posts and hunting and fishing settlements along the Potomac and Anacostia rivers shorelines. The first Native American tribe that is known to have settled the area was the Nacotchtank group (whose tribal name was later Europeanized to "Nacostines" and finally "Anacostians The Anacostia River is named after this Native American group b) European settlers began to displace the Nacotchtanks during the 1700s, as Native American settlements gave way to farm homesteads and tobacco plantations. This pattern of development was essentially maintained in Ward 8 until the early part of this century c) The establishment of institutional and "nuisance" uses in the Ward 8 area began with the building of Saint Elizabeth Hospital in 1852. After the Civil War, various industrial uses began to locate along the river shorelines on landfill. However, federal defense installations, including Belling Air Force Base, the Anacostia Naval Air Station and Naval Research Laboratory displaced most of the industrial uses during and after World War II d) Significant residential and commercial development did not begin in Ward 8 until the early I940s. In 1940, the ward’s population totaled only 17,985, or 3 percent, of the District’s then-current population of 663,000. Some 37 percent of the ward’s population (6,600 people) were then residents of Saint Elizabeth Hospital, which had become the federal government’s largest psychiatric treatment facility e) With the onset of World War II and the rapid expansion of federal agencies and employment, settlement boomed in Ward 8. Between 1940 and 1950, the population increased by 228 percent from roughly 18,000 to 59,100. To accommodate this growth, housing construction proceeded at a rapid pace. This development was particularly evident south of Saint Elizabeth Hospital in what are now the neighborhoods of Congress Heights, Bellview and Washington Highlands. Most of this construction was in the form of garden apartments, although some detached and semi-detached single family units were built along the Nichols (now Martin Luther King, Jr Avenue S.E. corridor. Despite this activity, Ward 8’s population was still just under 10 percent of the District’s total population by 1960 f) Prior to 1960, Ward 8’s population was primarily white. In fact, between 1940 and 1960, the percentage of white persons in the ward’s population ranged between 60 and 73 percent. 341 ENROLLED ORISINAL g) However, during the 1960s, urban renewal activities in the District west of the Anacostia River, co~nbined with the systematic construction of moderate-cost housing east of the river, led thousands of low- to middle-income black households to relocate to the ward. As a result, the ward’s black population rose to 89 percent of the total population as of 1970. By 1980, the black population in the ward was 90 percent. Conversely, Nard 8’s white population fell from a 1960 high of 45,500 persons to 6,230 people in 1980 SEC. 1200.800.5 NARD 8 TODAY a) Located in the southeast and southwest quadrants of the District, Ward 8 is generally bounded by the Potomac and Anacostia rivers to the west; the llth Street Bridge, Anacostia Freeway/I-295, Chicago Street S.E Morris Road S.E Erie Street S.E Reynolds Place S.E Langston Place S.E Ainger Place S.E Gainesville Street S.E and Naylor Road S.E. to the north; and Southern Avenue S.E./District Line to the southeast b) Existing Land Use Patterns 1) Some 74 percent of the land in Ward 8 is occupied by public facilities. These include the Bolling Air Force Base/Anacostia Naval Air Station/Naval Research Laboratory military complex, Saint Elizabeth Hospital, the Blue Plains Wastewater Treatment Plant, D.C. Village, Anacostia Park and Oxon Run Parkway. Many of these are situated in and near areas of the ward that are heavily wooded, providing a bucolic image and significant opportunities for open space and recreation. However, several major public areas are federal tracts and not open to the public. For instance, at the Bolling Air Force Base/Anacostia Naval Air Station/Naval Research Laboratory complex, public access to the Anacostia and Potomac rivers shorelines is completely cut off 2) Nearly all of the remaining land in Ward 8 is in residential use. Most of the housing consists of walk-up and garden apartment structures, with two high-rise apartment complexes on Southern Avenue S.E. and Martin Luther King, Jr. Avenue S.W. Single-family detached units are concentrated along the Martin Luther King, Jr. Avenue corridor, while clusters of newer townhouse units are located along Mississippi and Southern avenues S.E 3) Commercial services in the ward are limited to several neighborhood-scale clusters of shops and a number of scattered corner grocery/carryouts. The commercial nodes in the ward are located primarily along Martin Luther King, Jr. Avenue S.E. and South Capitol Street 4) Ward 8’s wooded slopes and expansive open spaces serve to clearly delineate its distinctive and somewhat contrasting neighborhoods such as Congress Heights, Washington Highlands and Barry Farm. They also enhance the ward’s predominantly residential quality despite the preponderance of institutional and public uses located there c) Neighborhoods 1) The neighborhoods of Ward 8 are shaped, to a significant extent, by the ward’s natural topography and man-made barriers such as the Anacostia Freeway/I-295. The ward’s neighborhoods include Barry 342 ENROLLED ORIGINAL Farm, Buena Vista, Douglass, Garfield Heights, Shipley Terrace, Congress Heights, Bellview and Washington Highlands 2) Barry Farm is the oldest and most historic neighborhood in the ward. It is dominated by the massive Barry Farms public housing complex, which has recently been renovated. The remaining area consists of walk-up apartment units and a few older single-family detached homes. Barry Farm is located just north of Saint Elizabeth Hospital 1(3) Buena Vista is immediately east of Barry Farm across Suitland Parkway S.E. Like Barry Farm, this neighborhood is dominated by multi-family housing, with single-family detached and semi-detached units on its eastern and southern borders. In this case, however, the housing is privately owned. Its hillside location affords very good views of downtown Washington and nearby Virginia. The neighborhood~s hilly topography has also resulted in narrow, winding streets. The Knox Hill housing development site borders this neighborhood on the east t(4) Douglass is southeast of Buena Vista. It contains a mixture of walk-up and garden apartment units, most of which are in two public housing complexes (Stanton Dwellings and Douglass Dwellings This neighborhood sits atop the long ridge which is Ward 8~s most prominent topographic feature 5) Garfield Heights is east of Douglass across Suitland Parkway S.E. It contains a mixture of single-family detached, walk-up and garden apartment units. One of the ward’s few elderly housing complexes is located immediately north of this neighborhood at the Knox Hill housing development site. The neighborhood borders Prince Georges County, Maryland 6) Shipley Terrace is south of Garfield Heights. Most of the housing in this neighborhood is walk-up and garden apartments, with semi-detached and rowhouse units near Southern Avenue S.E 7) Congress Heights is south of Saint Elizabeth Hospital. Single-family detached housing predominates in this area, unlike other parts of Ward 8. One of the two largest neighborhoods in the ward, Congress Heights extends from the Camp Simms development site west to the Anacostia Freeway/I-295 and south to South Capitol Street. The ward’s largest business district and only supermarket are located in this neighborhood. Congress Heights~ ridgetop location affords panoramic views of downtown Washington and nearby Virginia along its western border. vt(8) Bellview is south of Congress Heights. It contains the ward’s second largest concentration of single-family detached housing units (after Congress Heights A number of walk-up and garden apartment units are also in this neighborhood, along with one of the ward’s two high-rise apartment complexes. Like Congress Heights, this neighborhood sits atop the ridge which dominates the area. Hadley Memorial, one of the ward’s two hospitals, is in this neighborhood v(9) Washington Highlands is Ward 8~s largest and most populous neighborhood. Most of the housing in this neighborhood is a mixture of walk-up and garden apartment units, many of which are contained in public housing complexes such as Valley Green and Highland Dwellings. The ward’s second high-rise complex and several clusters of recently completed single-family townhouses are also in this neighborhood. Greater Southeast Community Hospital is immediately northeast of Washington Highlands. 343 ENROLLED ORIGINAL d) Commercial Areas/Nodal Development 1) Ward 8’s largest commercial area is the Martin Luther King, Jr. Avenue/Portland Street shopping district in Congress Heights. It extends along Martin Luther King, Jr. Avenue S.E. from Saint Elizabeth Hospital south to Fourth Street S.E. This district contains the ward’s only supermarket (a Safeway store its newest office building (the Forsythe Building, which houses the city’s Development Zone Administration, the East of the l~iver Community Development Corporation and a full-service D.C. Natural Gas branch office a new l~ite Aid drugstore, two gasoline service stations (Amoco and Chevron an Atlantic automobile parts outlet, two fast food outlets (McDonalds and Church’s Fried Chicken a barber shop, a beauty parlor and various other convenience outlets. Few, if any, comparison goods are offered in this shopping area. The Martin Luther King, Jr. Avenue/Portland Street shopping district is served by nearly every Metrobus route that serves the ward 2) The South Capitol/Atlantic streets commercial area is Ward 8’s second most significant shopping district. This area contains two drugstores (Peoples Drugs and Care Drugs a Riggs Bank branch, a Department of Employment Services (DOES) branch office, a Trak Auto parts store, three food stores (Murry’s, Highs and an independent store two liquor stores, a hardware store, an Exxon gasoline station, a beauty shop and other convenience outlets. The area offers a limited range of comparison goods but does not include clothing, appliances or other durable goods. The South Capitol/Atlantic streets shopping district is accessible by Metrobus 3) The ward’s third significant commercial area is the South Capitol Street/Southern Avenue shopping strip in Washington Highlands. This business area is dominated by auto-oriented convenience outlets including three gasoline stations (Sunoco, Shell and Exxon a drive-in First American Bank branch, a Hostess Bakery thrift outlet, a Burger King fast food outlet, the Congress Heights U.S. Postal Service branch and a liquor store. The South Capitol Street/Southern Avenue shopping area competes with the adjacent and much larger Eastover shopping center in Prince Georges County, Maryland, which contains a much wider variety of basic and comparison goods. Like Ward 8’s other two primary commercial areas, this district is accessible by Metrobus 4) Ward 8 contains several smaller neighborhood commercial areas or nodes as well as scattered corner convenience stores. The commercial nodes are located at Alabama Avenue and Stanton l~oad S .E Alabama Avenue and 23rd Street S.E Wheeler and Barnaby roads S.E and South Capitol and Elmira streets S.N e) Ward Demographic Characteristics 1) Population A) Ward 8 had an estimated population of 72,200 in 1990, a decrease of 7,800 persons, or about 9.8 percent, from 1980. During the 1980-1990 period, the District’s population decreased by 4.9 percent. In 1990 (the last year for which complete ethnic/racial population estimates are available the population was 91 percent black, 8 percent white and 1 percent other races. These figures are virtually unchanged from 1980 B) The city wide proportion of black, white and other races was 70 percent, 27 percent and 3 percent respectively in 1980; and 344 ENROLLED ORIGINAL 67 percent, 28 percent and 5 percent respectively in 1990. The evidence suggests that Ward 8’s racial composition has stabilized since 1980 C) Ward 8 has the youngest population of any ward. In 1990, 29 percent of the population was under 15 years of age, while only 20 percent was 45 years or older. This compares with city wide population figures of 16 percent under 15 years of age and 32 percent age 45 years or above for both 1980 and 1990. This difference in age distributions between the ward and the city was more pronounced in 1980. At that time, 31 percent of Ward 8’s population was under 15 years of age, while only 16 percent was 45 years or older 2) Housing A) Ward 8 has the lowest number of households of any ward in the city. A household is equivalent to any occupied housing unit. As shown in Table 2, the number of households in Ward 8 declined by 8 percent between 1980 and 1990, from 25,900 to 23,900 B) This compares with a decrease of 1.4 percent city wide during the same period. The mean household size in Ward 8 remains the highest of any ward in the city, although it did decrease from 3.0 persons in 1980 to 2.8 persons in 1990. The city wide figures were 2.3 for 1990 and 2.4 for 1980 C) The home ownership rate in Ward 8 remains the lowest in the city. It increased moderately from 14.0 percent in 1980 to 16.0 percent in 1990. The comparable city wide figures were 35 percent in 1980 and 39 percent in 1990 D) In 1990, Ward 8 had 7,900 housing units in one-unit structures (27 percent) and 21,000 housing units in structures containing two or more units (74 percent E) The median sales prices for row, semi-detached and detached houses in Ward 8 for 1987 was about $67,500, compared with a city wide median of $111,000. The ward’s median sales price was 39 percent below the city’s median sales price. The median sales price of condominiums in Ward 8 was $47,000 in 1987, compared with $78,000 city wide. This was a difference of 40 percent. In 1980, Ward 8’s median sales price for row, semi-detached and detached houses was 33 percent below the city’s median sales price. There were no condominium sales in the ward in 1980. The sales volume of row, semi-detached and detached houses was lower in 1987 than in 1980 (150 units in 1987 compared with 190 in 1980 Thirty condominiums were sold in 1987 3) Income A) Ward 8 had the lowest median household income of any ward in the city in 1989. Its median household income was about $21,300, or 31 percent below the city wide figure of $30,700. According to 1980 census data, the median household income for Ward 8 in 1979 was about $12,700, or 22 percent below the 1979 city wide figure of $16,200 B) Ward 8 had the highest percentage of households with incomes under $20,000 of any ward in the city in 1990. Forty-seven percent of the ward’s households had incomes below $20,000, compared with 32 percent of the city’s households overall. In 1979, 74 percent of the ward’s households had incomes under $20,000, compared with 59 percent for the city C) Ward 8 had the highest poverty rate of any ward in the city in 1989. The Bureau of Census defines poverty as a family of four with an annual income of $7,200 or less. Twenty-six percent of the 345 r NROUrg 6RIGINAL households were in poverty that year, compared with 15 percent city wide. In 1979, the ward’s poverty rate was 23 percent, compared with 17 percent for the city D) In 1989, Ward 8 had more persons receiving food stamps and Aid to Families with Dependent Children (AFDC) payments than any ward in the city (12,400 and 11,500, respectively Twenty and 21 percent of the ward’s population received food stamps and AFDC, respectively, compared with 7 and 8 percent city wide 4) Educational Status. Statistics indicate that the relative levels of education achieved by Ward 8 population maintained comparable trends in both 1980 and 1990. These figures indicate that the ward lagged significantly behind the city in both 1980 and 1990 in the percentage of its population that had completed college and high school. In 1980, 6 percent of the ward’s population aged 25 years or older had completed college compared to 25 percent completion city wide. In 1990, 8 percent of the ward’s population had completed college compared to a city wide completion rate of 33 percent. There was a high proportion of high school dropout in both 1980 and 1990. In 1980 the ward had a 25 percent high school dropout rate compared with the city’s rate of 17 percent. The gap widened in 1990 when the ward had a dropout rate of 33 percent compared with the city’s 21 5) Employment. Employment statistics for Ward 8 and the city indicate that during the 1980s, unemployment in Ward 8 remained significantly above city wide levels. In 1980, Ward 8’s unemployment level was 11.8 percent compared to 7.3 percent unemployment city wide. By 1990, the ward’s unemployment rate had risen to 12.3 percent. This compared, however, to a city wide unemployment level of 5 percent f) Current Development Activity 1) The Anacostia Metrorail Station area, at 1-295/Anacostia Freeway and Howard Road S.E has the greatest development potential of any development site in Ward 8. This heightened potential is primarily due to the site’s unique combination of waterfront, highway and public transportation access. The 125-acre site is in the Anacostia Development Zone. The Anacostia Metrorail Station on the Green line opened in December 1991. This station which has regional and local entrances greatly improves access for Ward 8 residents to the rest of the city 2) The 6,700-square-foot Forsythe Building represents the first major new office/commercial development in the ward. The building is at 3101 Martin Luther King, Jr. Avenue S.E. in the Martin Luther King, Jr. Avenue/Portland Street S.E. business district and the Alabama Avenue Development Zone. The Forsythe Building was completed in August 1990. The project is a joint public/private venture involving two major commercial banks as well as the city. The building houses a full-service office for the District of Columbia Natural Gas (formerly Washington Gas Light) Company, the East of the River Community Development Corporation and the Development Zone Administration 3) The Anacostia River is being restored under the provisions of the Chesapeake Bay Agreement, an interstate waterway cleanup compact. Within Ward 8, the city has focused on the need to restore the stream banks of Oxen Run between South Capitol Street and the District Line. This brief stretch of Oxen Run has experienced considerable erosion and illegal dumping. The Department of Recreation 346 ENROLLED ORIGINAL and Parks will be carrying out stream bank restoration along this portion of Oxon Run as funds permit 4) In 1986, the District began a major sewer construction program aimed at reducing the amount of untreated sewage being discharged into the Anacostia River and other water bodies flowing through the District. Major elements of this program include the construction of new interceptor storm sewers and a new-technology concentrating swirl separator facility. The swirl separator facility is being constructed at a site near ttFK Stadium. It will intercept overflow storm run-off and separate solids (including untreated sewage) prior to discharging into the adjacent Anaeostia River. Separated sewage will be sent to Blue Plains for treatment 5) The 175-acre Saint Elizabeth Hospital (SEH) West Campus (part of the larger 336-acre Saint Elizabeth Hospital tract) is designated in the Comprehensive Plan as a Special Treatment Area. The SEH West Campus is also located in the Anacostia Development Zone. The city is currently preparing a master plan for the redevelopment of up to 40 acres of the West Campus with appropriate mixed uses that will be compatible with the surrounding community, with the mental health treatment activities retained at the site and with development planned for the nearby Anacostia Metrorail Station area 6) The proposed D.C. Village Business and Industrial Park is in the D.C. Village Development Zone, which covers the entire 230-acre D.C. Village tract. Designated as a Special Treatment Area in the Comprehensive Plan, the tract lies between Martin Luther King, Jr. Avenue S.W. and 1-295/Anacostia Freeway, immediately southwest of the Bellview neighborhood. The city has completed a Request For Proposals (RFP) for the construction of the proposed development on a 15.6-acre site within the D.C. Village tract. The ILFP is currently under review 7) The 25-acre Camp Simms mixed-use development site is in the Alabama Avenue Development Zone and is designated as a Development Opportunity Area in the Comprehensive Plan. It lies east of 15th Street S.E. between Alabama and Mississippi avenues S.E. The District purchased this former D.C. National Guard site from the federal government in 1984 for mixed-use redevelopment. A ridge divides the site into a raised plateau along Alabama Avenue S.E zoned C-2-B) and a lower, almost-flat area along Mississippi Avenue S.E zoned It-3 and R-5-B The master plan developed by the Department of Housing and Community Development for the site calls for the development of a community shopping center on the C-2-B zoned land, an elderly housing complex on the l~-5-B zoned portion of the site and up to 168 townhouse units on the It-3 zoned land. The city is currently negotiating with a local housing developer to build townhouse units at the site 8) The Office of Planning is currently under contract with Basile Baumann Prost &amp;amp; Associates to prepare an implementation plan and associated marketing strategy for each of the East of the River Development Zones. The plans and marketing strategies are expected to be completed by the consultant by May 1993 9) The Department of Public and Assisted Housing completed a Comprehensive modernization of the Barry Farm Public Housing Complex in the summer of 1992. The renovated units feature new appliances and fixtures along with rowhouse-style exteriors. Outdoor lighting at Barry Farms, including street lights, have also been upgraded to increase 347 ENROLLED ORIGINAL neighborhood safety and security. The adjacent Barry Farm neighborhood, in the Anacostia Development Zone immediately north of Saint Elizabeth Hospital between Firth Sterling and Martin Luther King, Jr. avenues S.E is designated a Housing Opportunity Area in the Comprehensive Plan 10) The Monterey Park housing site is on vacant land immediately west of the Mary C. Terrell Elementary School on Wheeler Road S.E. in the Alabama Avenue Development Zone. The site is adjacent to another housing development site, Wheeler Hills Estate, that is a designated Housing Opportunity Area in the Comprehensive Plan. The Monterey Park housing site contains eight acres of R-5-A zoned land. A private developer recently received Large Tract Review approval to build 62 townhouse units on the site 11) The Knox Hill development site is at Alabama Avenue and Jasper Street S.E. in the Alabama Avenue Development Zone. The 23-acre former public housing site is designated in the Comprehensive Plan as a Housing Opportunity Area. Recently completed improvements on the site include a 125-unit elderly housing complex and the Seventh District Police Headquarters 12) The city selected a home builder in 1989 to develop 14 acres of the site, zoned P~-4, with up to 142 low- and moderate-income semi-detached townhouses. The site has been cleared, and construction is scheduled to begin during 1991 13) The Woodcrest housing development site is in the Alabama Avenue Development Zone at the intersection of Fourth Street and Mississippi Avenue S .E. It contains 5.8 acres of steeply sloped and wooded land that was formerly the U.S. Army Radar tract. A proposal to build 86 single-family townhouse units at the site received Large Tract l~eview approval in 1988. However, after subsequent modifications, the plans are to be resubmitted for Large Tract Review 14) The Washington Metropolitan Area Transit Authority (WMATA with the assistance of the District, has obtained additional federal funds to finance the completion of the Metrorail Green Line to its Branch Avenue terminus. Completion of this route will increase to three the number of Metrorail stations that are directly accessible to Ward 8 residents, including one in nearby Maryland that will be convenient to Washington Highlands residents 15) WMATA, with the assistance of the District, has put in place three minibus routes to serve underserved parts of Ward 8. These buses operate in Congress Heights, Douglass and Washington Highlands. They link with regular Metrobus routes, major commercial centers in or adjacent to the ward and the major hospital in the ward (Greater Southeast Community Hospital 16) The Department of Public Works (DPW Office of Bicycle Transportation, with the assistance of the Bicycle Advisory Council, has produced a bicycle transportation plan which includes a number of new routes in Ward 8. One new route is an extension of the Fort Circle Trail bike path from Fort Stanton Park just outside of Ward 8 to the Oxen Run Parkway bike trail. Other proposed routes would parallel Anacostia Park Drive S.E Suitland Parkway S.E Martin Luther King, Jr. Avenue S.E Alabama Avenue S.E Mississippi Avenue S.E. and South Capitol Street/Overlook Drive S.W. The National Park Service is planning to include the Anacostia Park and Fort Circle Trail segments in its capital 348 ENROLLED ORIGINAL budget. Capital authority has yet to be identified by DPW for the other proposed routes. ww(17) Representatives of the Congress Heights community in Ward 8 have expressed concern about the potential visual impact of the proposed National Childrenls Center on the surrounding residential area. The proposed $5-million treatment facility would provide day care for 60 adults and child development services for 90 children with multiple physical disabilities. The proposed site is at 3400 Martin Luther King, Jr. Avenue S.E. in the Alabama Avenue Development Zone. The R-4 zoned site was purchased in 1989 by the developer, National ChildrenWs Center, Inc NCC Negotiations are currently underway between NCC and representatives of the affected community regarding the scale and facade treatments of the proposed facility 18) The proposed Saint Elizabeth Hospital historic preservation inventory is part of the larger development planning effort being mounted by the Office of Business and Economic Development (OBED) for the SEH West Campus. The consultant selected by OBED to prepare the development plan is working closely with the Department of Consumer and Regulatory Affairs, Historic Preservation Division (HPD) to ensure the preservation of historic buildings and sites on the West Campus 19) The Congress Heights neighborhood historic resource survey was carried out in 1989 by HPD with the help of federal grant assistance from the U.S. Department of the InteriorWs Historic Preservation Fund. The survey was conducted with the assistance of neighborhood organizations and private preservation groups. This survey is part of a city wide effort to survey and inventory the District’s cultural heritage 20) The Senior Citizens Counseling and Delivery Service proposes to develop an elderly multi-purpose center at a three-acre site in the Alabama Avenue Development Zone, at the intersection of Martin Luther King, Jr. Avenue and Savannah Street S.E. The R-4 zoned site is part of the former Wilburn Tract housing development site. The proposed development would include a multi-purpose center housing programs for the elderly, related office space for staff and a residential complex, including 60 units of elderly housing and 16 townhouse units. In addition, through capital authority, the D.C. Office on Aging is proposing to construct a free-standing senior citizens multi-purpose center at a site to be determined 21) The Metropolitan Police Department (MPD) initiated the Community Empowerment Policing Program (CEPP) in 1989 in an effort to help drug-infested District neighborhoods regain control of their streets from drug users and pushers. The programts objectives are to increase police visibility, to organize and train residents in crime prevention techniques, to secure abandoned and vacant buildings and to mobilize District government agencies to focus on the social causes that contribute to criminal activity and delinquency. MPD with community cooperation, has established strong CEPP efforts at Valley Green Apartments (Washington Highlands Oak Park Apartments (Bellview Washington View Apartments (Buena Vista) and Elvans Road (Buena Vista In these areas, there has been a marked decrease of violence and drug activity. This reduction has been accomplished through citizen patrols and added police foot patrols. MPD is also cooperating with the D.C. Taxicab 349 ENROLLED ORIGINAL Commission in monitoring problems in Ward 8 related to hacker security to help reduce the threat of criminal violence against cab drivers in the area 22) The Department of Human Services, Office of Policy and Planning (DHS/OPP) is currently reviewing service utilization reports to determine how many health service centers might be needed in Ward 8. DHS/OPP is also assessing data relevant to health conditions in the total ward. The health and social status of Ward 8 will ultimately affect the city’s efforts for planned community changes in the ward under the East of the River Development Zones initiative SEC. 1200.801 WARD 8 ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT a) Increased economic development is a particularly critical need in Ward 8. Since the 1960s, the ward has trailed the rest of the city, based on most positive socio-economic indicators. The ward currently has the city’s highest unemployment rate and the greatest proportion and number of persons on public assistance b) The ward’s negative socio-economic image in the greater Washington community has had adverse impacts on potential investment in the ward. Because of this, significant public and private resources must be used to stimulate the development o[ commercial services, provide a diversity of housing types and create market-sensitive educational and training centers to improve the occupational skills of current ward residents c) With less than 2 percent of its land devoted to commercial uses, Ward 8 offers fewer commercial services to its residents than any other ward in the city. Existing services in the ward are generally limited to neighborhood-scale convenience and personal service outlets d) Only one supermarket, a Safeway, is located in Ward 8. It contains only 20,200 square feet of space. A report, Overview of l~etail Food Service Demand and Supply in the District of Columbia, prepared in 1988 by the Office of Business and Economic Development (OBED) and the Office of Policy, determined that Ward 8 contained only 11 percent of the total amount of food services retail space that it could support based on estimated demand e) This report estimated that Ward 8 could support three to four additional supermarket outlets. This clear shortage of supermarket service forces most Ward 8 residents to travel outside the ward to other parts of the District or to Prince Georges County, Maryland, to shop for groceries and other staple goods f) Other retail commercial services in Ward 8 are similarly limited. One family-style sit-down restaurant is located in the ward. Otherwise, eating establishments are limited to morn-and-pop carryouts and fast food chain outlets. Auto care retail services are also limited in Ward 8. With the exception of two auto parts retail outlets, these services are limited to "gas-and-go" service stations g) Ward 8’s severe shortage of quality (and other) commercial services forces its residents to travel out of the ward to obtain services that are readily available to residents of other wards in the city. A much greater amount and variety of conveniently located commercial services are needed h) Since 1980, the city has begun to lay the groundwork for meeting this need. The Comprehensive Plan, passed in 1984 and 1985, 350 £NROLL,r,D ORIGINAL set forth the general policy framework for the economic revitalization of declining neighborhoods in Nard 8. The plan designates 10 areas throughout the District as Special Treatment Areas in light of planning and development complexities affecting each of these areas. Two of these special planning areas are in Nard 8. In addition, the plan designates the Anacostia Metrorail Station site as both a Development Opportunity Area and a new or upgraded regional center (one of two to be located east of the Anacostia River The city sees the Anacostia Metrorail Station area as the major development catalyst that will trigger spin-off development projects throughout Nard 8. wt(i) In 1986, the city created three East of the River Development Zones (Anacostia, Alabama Avenue and D.C. Village Most of the areas within these zones lie within the borders of Ward 8. The intent of the development zones is to stimulate economic development by offering incentives to developers, first-time home buyers and employers who provide jobs and job training to zone residents. The Development of Human Services relocation of its administrative office to the Saint Elizabeth Campus will serve to increase the wardWs residents knowledge of and access to the Human Services facilities and programs available to them. ’(]) The District has targeted approximately $160 million over the next five years to achieve development zone objectives. For their part, private lending institutions and other investors have committed or planned to commit nearly $500 million for development projects in the zones. ’(k) In 1989, the Council of the District of Columbia (Council) passed the Supermarket Tax Incentive Act of 1988. This law is designed to provide tax incentives for the development of additional supermarket outlets in District neighborhoods that are presently underserved by supermarket chains. Ward 8 is a pri~ne candidate for the development of at least four modern, full-size supermarket outlets (including the proposed expansion of the existing Safeway food store In order to accomplish the objectives of the Development Zones initiative, the Council enacted "Economic Development Zones Incentives Amendment Act of 1988, D.C. Law 7-177~I. The regulations for tax incentives appeared in the District of Columbia Municipal Regulations on June 12, 1992 I) Finally, the city, through the Development Zones initiative, is focusing its resources on helping Ward 8 minority-owned and small businesses, and community-based development organizations. This comprehensive effort is based on the realization that the ward’s black and other minority-owned businesses face special problems, ranging from under-capitalization and insufficient marketing/management skills to the lack of control over the space which most of them occupy as renters. OBED will have the leading role in providing financial and technical assistance to the ward’s businesses and development organizations. I~SEC. 1200.802 WARD 8 OBJECTIVES ]?OR ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT ~The objectives for economic development are 1) Identify ways to support the economic development and related objectives of the East of the River Development Zones and the Neighborhood Partnership Program, including the enhancement of retail services and the creation of additional employment and venture opportunities within the ward. 351 ENROLLED ORIGINAL 2) Increase labor force job skill levels and expand job opportunities for ward residents, particularly the unemployed, the underemployed and youth preparing to enter the labor force 3) Increase venture development and market opportunities for businesses and community development organizations based or active in the ward SEC. 1200.803 WAP~D 8 ACTIONS IN SUPPOKT OF ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT "The policies in support of economic development are as follows 1) Plan and execute the upgrading of the Martin Luther King, Jr. Avenue/Portland Street S.E. commercial strip to provide an expanded range of commercial goods and services to nearby Congress Heights residents along with employees and visitors at Saint Elizabeth Hospital (SEH) and Boiling Air Force Base A) The Martin Luther King, Jr. Avenue/Portland Street S.E. commercial district is Ward 8’s largest business center. It sits astride the boundary between th.e Anacostia and Alabama Avenue development zones. It generally runs along Martin Luther King, Jr. Avenue S.E. from the southern boundary of Saint Elizabeth Hospital to Fourth Street S.E. The Comprehensive Plan designates the Martin Luther King, Jr. Avenue/Portland Street S.E. commercial district as a new or upgraded multi-neighborhood center suitable for moderate density commercial development. The Comprehensive Plan Amendments Act of 1989 (D.C. Law 8-129) also designates this business corridor as a Development Opportunity Area B) l~ecommended actions i) Coordinate commercial revitalization efforts in this commercial district, including the rehabilitation of existing retail establishments and the development of new ones, with development planning activities for the SEH West Campus ii) Continue to encourage new commercial development and the adaptive reuse or replacement of underused commercial properties in this shopping area iii) Assist the recently formed merchants association to promote and help maintain the area as an attractive shopping environment iv) Coordinate with area merchants to ensure that the refurbished Martin Luther King, Jr. Avenue/Portland Street S.E. shopping area contains adequate off-street parking and loading facilities v) Provide financial assistance to interested local merchants for commercial development, including commercial facade improvement and expanded business development ventures 2) Plan and execute the upgrading of the South Capitol/Atlantic streets commercial district to provide improved commercial goods and services to the surrounding Congress tteights and Bellview neighborhoods A) The South Capitol/Atlantic streets business district is the second largest commercial area in Ward 8. It is in the Alabama Avenue Development Zone. It generally runs along South Capitol Street from Martin Luther King, Jr. Avenue S.W. to Chesapeake Street S.W./S.E. The Comprehensive Plan designates this area as a new or 352 ENROLLED ORIGINAL upgraded multi-neighborhood center suitable for moderate density commercial development. WT(B) Recommended actions i) Continue to encourage new commercial development and the adaptive reuse or replacement of underused commercial properties in this shopping area ii) Encourage local merchants in the shopping district to form a merchants association to promote and help maintain the area as an attractive shopping environment iii) Ensure that the refurbished South Capitol/Atlantic streets shopping area contains adequate off-street parking and loading facilities iv) Provide financial assistance to interested local merchants for commercial development, including commercial facade improvement and expanded business development ventures w(3) Encourage the development of a major mixed-use commercial/retail/cultural/residential complex at the Anacostia Metro Development Opportunity Area to provide enhanced shopping services, and employment and business opportunities for Ward 8 residents and the city. Wl(A) The Anacostia Metro Development Opportunity Area is at Howard Road and 1-295/Anacostia Freeway S.E. in the Anacostia Development Zone (see Priority No 1 under LAND USE/ZONING for area boundaries and other details regarding proposed land use This development site is considered by the city to possess greater economic development potential than any other single development opportunity site in Ward 8. The city and the ward community see careful development of this area as a key catal:~st to economic development throughout the rest of the ward. it(B) Recommended actions i) Complete a small area study in this area (see Priority No. 1 under LAND USE/ZONING for additional details regarding the recommended process ii) Use First Source Employment Agreements and other job training and placement measures to ensure the maximum possible number of job opportunities for Ward 8 residents resulting from private development at the site iii) Ensure meaningful venture opportunities for Ward 8 businesses and resident entrepreneurs as a result of development at the Anacostia Metro Station development site. Minority business set asides, loans and loan guarantees, industrial revenue bonds and city-sponsored small business incubators are among the tools that may be used to achieve this objective 4) Expand and improve supermarket food services in Ward 8 so that residents may have adequate, convenient and affordable grocery shopping opportunities in the ward A) The city has estimated that Ward 8 could support additional supermarkets in or near the following neighborhoods: Barry Farm and Buena Vista (the store serving these areas would also serve adjacent Ward 6 neighborhoods Congress Heights, Shipley Terrace and Douglass (all to be served by a single additional store possibly at Camp Simms Washington Highlands (potential location at South Capitol Street 353 ENROLLED ORIGINAL and Southern Avenue S.W and Bellview (potential location on South Capitol Street near Atlantic Street S.W B) l~tecommended actions i) Promote and encourage supermarket food chains to expand and/or locate full-service, modern supermarket outlets in Ward 8 neighborhoods it) Put into effect the tax regulations designed to implement the provisions of the 1988 Supermarket Tax Incentive Act so that this additional incentive can be used to help generate the development of additional supermarket outlets in Ward 8 iii) Work with the affected communities to identify and screen suitable sites for new or expanded supermarket outlets within the ward iv) Ensure that proposed supermarkets, including adequate off-street parking and loading space, are designed as part of larger commercial/retail centers (existing or new) and are compatible with surrounding neighborhoods 5) Develop additional commercial services in Ward 8 to help meet residents’ needs A) Only two drugstores and one hardware store are located in Ward 8. All three of these outlets are in the South Capitol/Atlantic streets commercial district. The ward contains no general merchandise or apparel outlets and only one family-style restaurant. On the other hand, Ward 8 contains at least nine liquor stores, including three in the Martin Luther King, Jr. Avenue/Portland Street S .E. commercial strip alone B) l~ecommended actions i) Conduct updated market studies, with the cooperation of the Ward 8 community, to determine the desired and economically viable level and mix of retail goods and services to be located in Ward 8’s major commercial areas. The primary, but not sole, uses focused upon by this research effort should include food, drug and auto care services it) Market Ward 8’s commercial areas to potential investors, with specific emphasis on commercial revitalization activities in these areas, including facade restoration, new streetscape construction, commercial loan and tax incentives, code enforcement and the formation of merchants associations for each of the ward’s larger commercial areas iii) Continue to strictly enforce recently revised zoning regulations restricting the location of new fast-food outlets in or near residential areas in Ward 8 iv) Encourage developers of new or renovated commercial development to include full-service family-style restaurants in their building plans, where feasible v) Encourage the renovation and expansion of Ward 8’s one existing supermarket outlet and the building of three additional full-size supermarkets (possibly including one at South Capitol Street/Southern Avenue S.W The modernized and expanded existing supermarket could serve as a major catalyst for additional private development in the surrounding commercial area 6) Expand and improve the level of auto care services within Ward 8 for the benefit of ward residents who own or use automobiles. 354 ENROLLED ORIGINAL A) No full-service gasoline or auto repair facilities are located in Ward 8. Auto care services in the ward are limited to: Two auto parts retail outlets on Martin Luther King, Jr. Avenue S.E. and South Capitol Street, respectively; and Eight "gas-and-go" service station outlets: three on Martin Luther King, Jr. Avenue S.E one on Alabama Avenue S.E and four on South Capitol Street B) Recommended actions i) Identify suitable commercial/industrial sites for new or expanded auto repair shop and full service gasoline stations ii) Work with national oil companies to establish new full-service gasoline stations at appropriate locations in the ward iii) Encourage, through the use of commercial loan and technical assistance programs, the establishment of additional full-service gasoline stations and auto repair shops at sites previously identified by the city as suitable for auto services 7) Develop attractive training and employment alternatives to drug-related criminal activity for Ward 8’s underused labor force, particularly its youths A) Ward 8 has the highest unemployment and poverty rates of any ward in the city. These factors count heavily in the involvement of many of the ward’s youth and somewhat-older unemployed residents in illegal drug trafficking. Neighborhoods that are particularly hard-hit by this problem include: Washington Highlands; Barry Farm; Shipley Terrace; and Douglass B) l~ecommended actions i) Bring additional education, training and employment opportunities to the ward ii) Establish agreements with adjacent suburban jurisdictions to match qualified Ward 8 and other inner-city workers with employment opportunities in labor-short suburban employment centers 8) Provide increased technical and financial assistance to black and other minority-owned and small businesses in Ward 8 to help them provide needed goods and services to the ward’s residents on a profitable basis A) Most black and other minority-owned and small businesses in Ward 8 are under-capitalized and their owners often lack solid business management and marketing skills. These problems render the affected businesses economically marginal, at best, in their operations. In addition, most of these businesses lease, instead of own, their space. Hence, they have little control over their own tenancy or stake in the overall well-being of the commercial areas where they are located. Commercial areas where large concentrations of struggling business establishments are located include: Martin Luther King, Jr. Avenue/Portland Street S.E South Capitol/Atlantic streets; and South Capitol Street/Southern Avenue S .E B) Recommended actions i) Persuade and help local merchants to organize viable merchants associations as a means of providing "self-help" in conducting business throughout the ward ii) Contract with private-sector technical assistance providers to run "project-oriented development" clinics for community-based development organizations active in Ward 8. At these clinics, projects that are planned or underway would be thoroughly 355 ENROLLED ORIGINAL evaluated for overall feasibility or effectiveness in helping the sponsoring organizations to meet their development goals iii) Help community-based development organizations in Ward 8 to develop marketing packages to publicize their projects and services iv) Survey minority business ownership patterns in Ward 8 to ascertain the specific nature of the special problems facing black and other minority business owners in the ward v) Establish financial and regulatory incentives to encourage black and other minority entrepreneurs to establish, expand and diversify operations to meet the business and consumer needs of Ward 8 vi) Conduct an inventory of vacant and underused commercial space in all of the wardWs major business districts to identify properties which might be used to help start a shopsteading program, whereby prospective or existing business owners might obtain new space for a nominal fee plus the cost of needed improvements to bring the property up to codes vii) Analyze the feasibility of operating a shopsteading program, taking into account the potential availability of underused and vacant commercial properties which might be acquired by the city for such a purpose vii]) Initiate a shopsteading program within the ward on a demonstration basis (once the feasibility of operating such a program has been established ix) Assist qualified Ward 8 black and other minority businesses in obtaining minority business enterprise (MBE) certification so that they can take advantage of contracting opportunities in the Sheltered Market program established under D.C. Law 1-95 x) Establish small business incubator centers in Ward 8 to provide struggling businesses with lower-cost space and centralized business support services at a significantly lower cost. The city is establishing such small business development centers in other commercial areas within the District. A number of other U.S. cities already contain such facilities SEC. 1200.804 WARD 8 HOUSING a) Ward 8 has a wide range of housing types. Single-family detached structures on sizable lots are interspersed with townhouses and apartments. However, the predominant housing pattern is a profusion of garden and walk-up apartments b) Ward 8 has the smallest percentage of owner-occupied housing units of any ward in the city, 17 percent. The ward also contains the city’s second largest concentration of public housing. Since 1980, renovation has begun or been completed on many of these units. However, the city faces a serious problem in finding the resources to maintain these units or complete the massive job of renovating Ward 8’s public housing c) To stabilize many of the neighborhoods in Ward 8, it is the policy of the District to encourage a balance between owner-occupied and rental housing as well as to upgrade and maintain public housing in Ward 8. In support of these policies, the city has encouraged, in recent years, the conversion of a small number of rental units to condominiums. 356 ENROLLED ORIGINAL The city has also encouraged the formation of public housing tenant organizations throughout Ward 8 and the rest of the District to participate in the maintenance and upkeep of the units d) The most noticeable housing trend in Ward 8 since 1978 has been the construction of large numbers of new single-family townhouses throughout the ward. These townhouses are along Southern Avenue S.E Wheeler Road S.E Barnaby Road S.E. and Mississippi Avenue S.E, among other places. Several sites along Mississippi Avenue and Alabama Avenue S.E. have been proposed for additional townhouse development (Camp Simms, Knox Hill, Monterey Park and Woodcrest e) It is important that suitable housing be provided in the ward for elderly residents. Until 1986, there were no housing units in Ward 8 specifically designed for older residents, tIowever, the elderly comprised 4 percent of the ward’s population in 1980, and the number is increasing. Recently, 125 units of elderly housing were completed at the Knox Hill development site. Additional units have also been proposed for Camp Simms and a site at Martin Luther King, Jr. Avenue and Savannah Street S.E f) In 1986, the District government established the East of the River Development Zones to foster housing and economic development activity in Ward 8 and adjacent portions of Far Southeast Washington. Of these, the Alabama Avenue Development Zone was formed primarily for the purpose of promoting housing development along the Alabama Avenue S.E. and Martin Luther King, Jr. Avenue S.E. corridors. To accomplish this overall objective, the Department of Housing and Community Development and the D.C. Housing Finance Agency have developed and are implementing an assortment of financing and related tools to assist potential new homeowners. Several incentives for first-time home buyers are included in the package of policies currently being implemented in the East of the River Development Zones SEC. 1200.805 WARD 8 OBJECTIVES FOR HOUSING "The objectives for housing are 1) Increase the number of owner-occupied and single-family housing units in the ward 2) Provide additional housing for older citizens 3) Maintain and improve existing housing, especially public housing, for present and future residents 4) Control the conversion of residential housing to nonresidential and transient use 5) Promote new and rehabilitated housing to meet all levels of need and demand, and provide incentives to construct the types of housing needed at desired locations 6) Provide housing opportunities for low- and moderate-income households by promoting the construction and renovation of a range of housing types SEC. 1200.806 WARD 8 ACTIONS IN SUPPORT OF HOUSING "The policies in support of housing are as follows 1) Promote an increase in the level of home ownership in Ward 8 to help stabilize and improve residential neighborhoods A) Ward 8 has the lowest level of home ownership of any ward in the city. Single-family housing in the ward is concentrated 357 ENROLLED ORIGINAL primarily in the following neighborhoods: Congress Heights west of Martin Luther King, Jr. Avenue S.E. and north of Alabama Avenue S.E Bellview west of South Capitol Street and north of Danbury Street S.W Buena Vista east of 16th Street S.E. and south of Erie Street S.E Shipley Terrace south of Savannah Street S.E. and east of 23rd Street S.E and Washington Highlands along Southern Avenue S.E between Wheeler Road and 13th Street S.E at Valley Terrace S.E and between Bonini and Sixth streets S.E B) Recommended actions i) Continue and expand home ownership assistance programs in Ward 8, including the Home Purchase Assistance Program (HPAP Homestead Housing Preservation Program (which recycles tax-delinquent residential properties) and Tenant Purchase Assistance Program (TPAP ii) Expand bond-financed home purchase assistance efforts in Ward 8 iii) Provide increased technical and financial assistance to nonprofit housing providers who wish to develop new single-family housing in Ward 8 iv) Expand the Land Acquisition for Housing Development Opportunities (LAHDO) program to finance private-sector housing and mixed-use residential development projects in Ward 8 2) Rehabilitate abandoned and underused privately owned apartment buildings within Ward 8 or replace them with new and more appropriate residential uses A) Renovation of public and privately owned multi-family housing in Ward 8 has significantly reduced the number of abandoned and blighted apartment units in the ward since 1980. Nevertheless, a number of blighted and abandoned apartment structures remain at scattered sites throughout the ward. These structures are not only eyesores within their surroundings, but are potential harbors for criminal activity as well. Locations of such housing include: Shipley Terrace at 23rd and Savannah streets S.E Buena Vista and Shipley terraces S.E. adjacent to Knox Hill; 13th Street S.E. between Alabama and Mississippi Avenues S.E. in Congress Heights; and Danbury Street S.W. between South Capitol Street and Martin Luther King, Jr. Avenue S.W. in Bellview B) Recommended actions i) Place vacant multi-family properties that have not been maintained by their owners under the "Clean It or Lien It’~ program. Costs incurred by the city in cleaning up such properties could then be charged against the properties as liens. Unpaid liens on any properties past a certain point in time would then be subject to further action by the city ii) Continue and expand the Distressed Properties Program in Ward 8 to provide tax incentives for the rehabilitation of vacant rental housing iii) Expand the use of Low-Income Housing Tax Credits (LIHTCs) in Ward 8 to persuade for-profit home builders to provide new or rehabilitated low-income housing units iv) Continue and expand the Section 8 Program for rental housing subsidies in Ward 8 to increase affordable housing opportunities for eligible renters. 358 ENROLLED ORIGINAL "SEC. 1200.807 WARD 8 ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION a) The Environmental Protection Element of the Comprehensive Plan encompasses the protection of the natural environment and the regulation of the built environment in ways that maintain and elevate the quality of life and the sense of well-being of the city’s residents, workers and visitors. The District government is currently expanding its efforts to improve the environmental quality in Ward 8. A leading environmental protection issue in the ward is the preservation of the area’s natural environment. The ward’s winding roadways and hilly topography help to shape some of the city’s most attractive natural vistas. There are points in the ward that offer panoramic views of the Virginia shoreline, the Monumental Core and portions of Prince Georges and Montgomery counties in Maryland. Many Ward 8 residents are understandably sensitive to proposals to develop some of these areas. t’(b) Soil erosion is a serious problem in the ward due to its unstable clay-based soil types and hilly terrain. This problem has been exacerbated by insensitive construction practices that prevailed throughout the ward in the past. Litter and debris are another serious issue, especially near vacant or boarded-up housing units which are also havens for rodents. Abandoned vehicles and illegal dumping are additional environmental concerns in the ward. The "Clean It or Lien It" program is being implemented on properties throughout the ward, the War on Rats program has been expanded, and general code enforcement increased c) A portion of the Saint Elizabeth Hospital East Campus was used in recent years for the dumping of fly ash from the city’s solid waste incinerator. The local community is concerned that heavy metal residues in the ash may be leaching into the ground on and off the site d) The District has tested the ash on several occasions and has found that it is non-hazardous. The ash disposal site has been closed, covered with topsoil and seeded to contain the ash material, and there is no evidence of groundwater contamination at the site. Still, the District government has asked the U.S. Public Health Commission to review the environmental data regarding ash disposal at the site, to determine whether any potential health problems exist and to recommend further remedial actions where necessary e) Air and water quality are another major issue in Ward 8. Residents who live near the Blue Plains Wastewater Treatment Plant raise the issue of foul air. The water quality of the Anacostia River is another area of concern, because the ward’s soil types and hilly topography result in the washing of large amounts of soil and debris into the streams feeding into the Anacostia River. This diminishes the quality of both the Anacostia and Potomac rivers as well as the streams located in the ward that feed into them f) The District is a participant under an interstate compact, the Chesapeake Bay Agreement, signed by the District of Columbia, Virginia, Maryland, Pennsylvania and the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA The purpose of this compact is to promote interjurisdictional efforts to halt pollution of the Chesapeake Bay and contain or reverse environmental impacts that result from that pollution g) l~inally, the Comprehensive Plan Amendments Act of 1989 requires the city to draw up and enforce new environmental review 359 ENROLLED ORIGINAL regulations that mandate an assessment of environmental impacts for all proposed development exceeding one million dollars in value SEC. 1200.808 WARD 8 OBJECTIVES FOR ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION "The objectives for environmental protection are 1) Protect the overall environmental quality of the District’s land areas by preventing further soil erosion, promoting the restoration of eroded areas and enforcing prohibitions against illegal dumping and other destructive practices 2) Promote public health and sanitation through the enactment and enforcement of regulations regarding food storage and handling; rodent control; elimination of rubbish pileups on vacant property; transport and disposal of hazardous waste; and noise abatement 3) Improve the quality of water in the rivers and streams of the District to meet public health and recreational water quality standards, and to improve the physical, chemical and biological integrity of these watercourses for multiple uses, including fishing, swimming and other recreation 4) Ensure adequate protection of public health and safety in the ward by testing for and removing lead, radon gas, asbestos and other hazardous substances from the manmade environment 5) Improve and develop safe and effective methods of collection, management and disposal of solid waste, including the management and disposal of sewage sludge 6) Improve the quality of the air of the District and the region to meet public health standards 7) Protect the environment in ways that maintain and elevate the quality of life and the sense of well-being for Ward 8’s residents, workers and visitors SEC. 1200.809 WARD 8 ACTIONS IN SUPPORT OF ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION "The policies in support of environmental protection are as follows 1) Prevent illegal or improper dumping of hazardous or other waste in Ward 8 A) Considerable community concern was raised about the recently closed ash disposal site at Saint Elizabeth Hospital’s East Campus. Littering and illegal dumping of trash is also a problem at such locations as Morris Road S.E. and Oxon P~un, southwest of South Capitol Street B) Recommended actions i) Strictly enforce anti-dumping ordinances to prevent future illegal or improper dumping in Ward 8 ii) Provide other means of disposal of hazardous and other waste as alternatives to illegal dumping 2) Correct soil erosion problems at existing residential and commercial developments in Ward 8, and ensure that new developments incorporate measures to mitigate potential soil erosion impacts A) Numerous sites throughout the ward exhibit signs of significant erosion. This problem is especially noticeable in the following locations: Sayles Place S.E. between Stanton and Douglass roads S.E. in Buena Vista (Washington View Apartments Elvans Road S.E. 360 ENROLLED ORIGINAL in Buena Vista; Fifteenth and Savannah streets S.E. in Congress Heights; Condon Terrace and Eighth Street S.E. in Washington Highlands; Mississippi Avenue S.E. and South Capitol Street in Congress Heights; and Danbury Street S.W. in Bellview B) Recommended actions i) Revise, on a priority basis, current permitting procedures to incorporate the new environmental review procedures developed in accordance with the environmental review requirements of the 1989 Comprehensive Plan Amendments Act ii) Give priority to the environmental review of major development slated for Ward 8 sites which have been identified by the city as suffering from soil instability or drainage problems iii) Strengthen related environmental review procedures, such as the Large Tract Review process, in accordance with the revised environmental review regulations developed by DCRA SEC. 1200.810 WARD 8 TRANSPORTATION a) Since the beginning of Metrorail service and the acquisition of the Washington metropolitan area~s private transit bus companies by the Washington Metropolitan Area Transit Authority (WMATA the city’s public transportation system has been rated one of the best in the nation. The Metrorail system provides most of the District with excellent service despite the burdens of morning and evening rush hours, noontime lunch rushes and millions of tourists and other visitors to the city b) This, however, does not hold true for Ward 8 at the present time. Direct Metrorail service is not scheduled for the ward until late 1991 or early 1992, when the Anacostia Metro Station (currently under construction) will open for service c) Metrobus provides the primary means of public transportation for Ward 8 residents. Although bus service is generally adequate during rush hours, much of the ward is poorly served at other times. This is a serious problem because fewer than 40 percent of the ward’s adult residents own automobiles d) In addition, the ward is cut off from much of the District by the Anacostia l~iver. Only two bridges (Frederick Douglass/South Capitol Street and llth Street) directly connect the ward with portions of the District west of the river e) The ward is conveniently served by the region’s highway network through 1-295, South Capitol Street and Suitland Parkway S.E. The local street system has been shaped much more by the area~s rugged terrain than by the L~Enfant/Banneker grand plan. Streets are generally winding and hilly. Since 1986, the city has undertaken a major road reconstruction program in Ward 8. Major sections of South Capitol Street and Martin Luther King, Jr. Avenue S.E./S.W. are currently under repair or slated for repair/reconstruction f) Ward 8~s existing commercial districts are all surrounded by residential uses. Ward residents generally welcome the planned upgrading of most of these areas for the additional retail shopping and employment opportunities that will be created. However, residents who live near these commercial areas are concerned about the potential impacts of increased traffic and associated parking on their neighborhoods. W(g) Parking in the ward’s residential areas is generally adequate, especially in single-family housing areas. Commercial areas, however, 361 ENROLLED ORIGINAL are inadequately supplied. Off-street parking and loading facilities are virtually non-existent in most of Ward 8’s commercial centers, and on-street parking is limited. This contributes to congestion along the ward’s major commercial thoroughfares h) Bicycle transportation has received attention from the District since the late 1970s as an energy-efficient commuter mode as well as a health-promoting recreational activity. Both the District and federal governments are planning city wide and regional bike route improvements which include the construction of several new routes in Ward 8 i) The only existing bicycle route in Ward 8 is a bike trail which runs through Oxen Run Parkway from 13th Street S.E. to South Capitol Street. The trail is poorly lit and partially hidden by woods, conditions which contribute to low levels of observed use j) Ward 8’s other primary means of mass transportation is the paratransit mode of taxicabs. Unfortunately, taxicab service in the ward is generally inadequate even during rush hours. Ward residents trying to return from other parts of the city often find cab drivers unwilling to take them across the river. For their part, many cab drivers express concern about perceived high levels of drug-related criminal activity in the ward k) The opening of the Anacostia Metro Station in 1991 or early 1992 is expected to provide a major improvement in public transit service and to serve as a catalytic agent for the redevelopment of land around the station. It is expected to serve as a temporary terminus for the Metrorail Green Line until the route can be extended to its ultimate terminus at Branch Avenue in Prince Georges County, Maryland. Metrobus routes will be modified or rerouted to provide direct service to the Anacostia Metrorail Station SEC. 1200.811 WARD 8 OBJECTIVES FOR TRANSPORTATION "The objectives for transportation are’ 1) Provide a balanced transportation network incorporating all modes of transportation including mass transit, private automobiles, bicycling and walking 2) Improve and maintain neighborhood streets, thereby facilitating commerce, supporting growth and development and expanding businesses and job opportunities SEC. 1200.812 WARD 8 ACTIONS IN SUPPORT OF TRANSPORTATION "The policies in support of transportation are as follows 1) Upgrade taxicab service in Ward 8 to a ]eve] comparable with taxicab service provided to District neighborhoods west of the Anacostia River A) Taxicab service in Ward 8 is generally inadequate throughout the ward, but especially in the following neighborhoods: Congress Heights; Washington Highlands; and Barry Farm B) Recommended actions i) Meet with the community and the local taxi industry to hash out all valid concerns regarding the level and quality of taxicab service in Ward 8 ii) Increase taxi service throughout Ward 8 and east of the Anacostia River generally, as follows: increase the number 362 ENROLLED ORIGINAL of licensed taxicabs; enforce regulations requiring drivers not to discriminate in answering calls or picking up passengers; establish or promote livery service (whereby transportation to and from specified points is obtained by telephone and provided for a fee establish a 24-hour hotline through which citizens can lodge complaints against discriminating drivers and taxicab companies; and establish cab stands and delivery points at hospitals, fire stations, police substations or other public facilities in Ward 8 iii) Develop specific strategies for correcting specific problems related to hacker security (from criminal attack) and discrimination against prospective fares wishing to travel to Ward 8 and other parts of the District east of the Anacostia ILiver. wW(iv) Provide financial and regulatory incentives as well as technical assistance to prospective minority entrepreneurs to provide better taxicab service to Ward 8 residents 2) Increase off-street parking and loading facilities in Ward 8~s commercial areas to accommodate customers and deliveries and reduce traffic congestion A) With the exception of the commercial nodes along South Capitol Street, Ward 8Ws commercial areas are generally deficient in the amount of off-street parking and loading space provided for shoppers and delivery vehicles. Among the commercial areas that are especially disadvantaged in this regard are: Martin Luther King, Jr. Avenue/Portland Street S.E Martin Luther King, Jr. Avenue S.E. between Chicago Street and Suitland Parkway S.t and Alabama Avenue and 23rd Street S.t B) Recommended actions i) Work with local merchants of and affected neighborhoods bordering the ward’s major business centers to identify potential sites for off-street parking or loading facilities that will result in minimal disruption to adjacent residential uses ii) Allocate capital funds on a timely basis to acquire land, where necessary, and construct off-street parking and loading facilities 3) t~nsure that new nonresidential development projects in Ward 8 include measures designed to mitigate potential traffic impacts on adjacent residential areas A) Commercial areas with planned upgrading which could generate unwanted traffic impacts include: Martin Luther King, Jr. Avenue/Portland Street S.E Martin Luther King, Jr. Avenue/l~irst Street S.t Alabama Avenue and 13th Street S.E new area to be created Camp Simms/Alabama Avenue and Stanton Road S.E Savannah and 23rd streets S.E Wheeler and Barnaby roads S.t South Capitol/Atlantic streets S.E./S.W and South Capitol Street/Southern Avenue S. t B) tLecommended actions i) ttequire applicable proposed new nonresidential development undergoing zoning/Large Tract Review or permit processing to incorporate suitable traffic planning and management measures designed to minimize impacts on adjacent residential areas ii) Take potential traffic impacts into account in identifying sites for proposed off-street parking/loading facilities or other 363 ENROLLED ORIGINAL new nonresidential development adjacent to or near existing residential areas SEC. 1200.813 WARD 8 PUBLIC FACILITIES a) Ward 8 contains a large number of city-owned facilities. The largest of these include Saint Elizabeth Hospital East Campus, Blue Plains Wastewater Treatment Plant, the D.C. fire and police academies, the Seventh District Police Headquarters and D.C. Village. In addition, Ward 8 contains 3 neighborhood health clinics, 14 recreation centers, 5 swimming pools, 11 tennis courts, 3 fire stations, 2 public library branches, 19 elementary schools, 3 junior high schools and 1 senior high school b) The city has been actively involved in upgrading public facilities in Ward 8. Bridges and sewer systems are being replaced and/or modernized. A library kiosk and a modern fire station have been constructed within the ward since 1986 (at Alabama Avenue and Stanton Road S.E. and First and Atlantic streets S.E respectively and the new Seventh District Police Headquarters building opened in 1989 at Alabama Avenue and Jasper Street S.E Knox Hill c) The Department of l~ecreation and Parks (DRP) is planning to carry out several capital improvement projects in Ward 8 between 1990 and 1993. DRP plans to rehabilitate the field house at the Congress Heights Recreation Center, build a new playground at the Knox Hill development site and renovate the former Anacostia Neighborhood Museum building on Martin Luther King, Jr. Avenue S.E. for use as a children’s theater and arts center. DRP has received capital authority for the arts center and plans to develop it during 1992-1993. DRP also plans to construct a new senior citizens center as an addition to the Bald Eagle Recreation Center d) In 1987, the University of the District of Columbia expressed an interest in establishing a satellite campus or facility at a site in Ward 8. Since 1970, the Ward 8 community has pursued the idea of establishing an institution of higher learning in the ward. The community’s interest in establishing such a facility stems from the fact that Ward 8 residents, since the early 1970s, have made up a significant portion of those District residents enrolled in publicly funded institutions of higher learning in the city SEC. 1200.814 WAleD 8 OBJECTIVES FOR PUBLIC FACILITIES "The objectives for public facilities are 1) Ensure that adequate and high quality neighborhood-based public services and facilities are available and accessible to the Ward 8 community at a minimal cost 2) Ensure coordinated planning, construction, renovation and maintenance of public facilities that are essential in supporting an adequate public service delivery program SEC. 1200.815 WAleD 8 ACTIONS IN SUPPORT OF PUBLIC FACILITIES "The policies in support of public facilities are as follows 1) Establish a satellite campus or facility for post-secondary education in Ward 8 to improve its residents’ access to higher learning and professional career development opportunities. 364 ENROLLED ORIGINAL A) Residents of Ward 8 comprise a significant portion of the University of the District of Columbia (UDC) student body. However, there is no UDC or other post-secondary educational facility in Ward 8. Access to existing UDC and other university or college facilities from Ward 8 is hampered by its relative isolation from parts of the District west of the Anacostia River. Potential sites for such a facility include: Anacostia Metrorail Development Opportunity Area and Saint Elizabeth Hospital West Campus B) Recommended actions i) Bring the Ward 8 community and UDC representatives together to investigate the general feasibility of locating a satellite facility in Ward 8 ii) Assist in the establishment of a formal planning process for the proposed satellite facility 2) Establish a multi-service recreational center that will address both recreational and community cultural needs in Ward 8 A) Ward 8 contains no recreational facility capable of supporting positive nonsports related cultural activities for the ward’s youth and other residents. Community leaders have stated that the development of a facility that would address recreational as well as cultural needs is one of the ways to expose the ward’s youth to attractive, lifestyle alternatives to involvement in illegal drug trafficking. Saint Elizabeth Hospital’s West Campus has been suggested by the community as a potential site for such a facility B) Recommended actions i) Conduct a needs assessment study to determine the appropriate mix of activities and amount of space needed for the proposed Children’s Art center ii) Generate and evaluate recreational and cultural alternatives for the facility on the basis of feasibility and compatibility with proposed uses and adjacent or nearby residential uses iii) Select and implement cultural/artistic activities for the proposed center iv) Provide for community participation in the planning and implementation process to assist the District in responding to community needs SEC. 1200.816 WARD 8 UP, BAN DESIGN a) The physical character of Ward 8 is unique within the city. Its rugged, wooded ridges and slopes have shaped the road system, in many places, into a network of twists and turns. The ward also offers unparalleled hilltop vistas of the Monumental Core, the Anacostia and Potomac rivers, and parts of nearby Maryland and Virginia b) Unfortunately, prior development in the ward has been insensitive to the ward’s scenic amenities. Apartment buildings have literally turned their backs to the vistas at some locations, and site preparation at other locations has failed to include effective soil retention measures. As a result, soil erosion is evident at most of these locations. Proposed improvements must be carefully scrutinized to ensure that the physical integrity of the ward is protected c} Ward 8 residents are increasingly concerned about the balancing of proposed residential and commercial improvements with the natural amenities of the ward. In particular, the ward’s commercial areas are 365 ENROLLED ORIGINAL seen by residents as unattractive and lacking a "sense of place These areas generally lack cohesion and are in need of improvement d) The District government is working to enhance the design quality of the built environment within Ward 8. The Office of Business and Economic Development has initiated a Neighborhood Partnership Program in the ward to bring together local merchants, concerned citizens, private developers and appropriate government representatives to devise strategies that will help revitalize some of the ward’s commercial areas e) Commercial facade standards have been designed for a five-block section of Martin Luther King, Jr. Avenue S.E centering on its intersection with Portland Street S.E. The South Capitol/Atlantic streets commercial center and the neighborhood retail center at South Capitol and Elmira streets S.W. are also receiving attention under this program f) Negotiations are underway with merchants and property owners in other Ward 8 retail centers to establish additional improvement programs SEC. 1200.817 WARD 8 OBJECTIVES FOR URBAN DESIGN "The objectives for urban design are 1) Maintain and enhance the physical integrity and character of the District as the National Capital, including Ward 8 2) Preserve and enhance the distinguishable physical qualities of Ward 8 neighborhoods ’(3) Restrict and sensitively design new development proposed to be placed on severe slopes and unstable soils 4) Create and enhance relationships between the rivers and Ward 8 residents, develop urban waterfronts and water-related recreation in appropriate locations and establish attractive pedestrian connections from neighborhoods to activities along the waterfronts 5) Encourage developments that respond to the prominent ridgelines of Ward 8 and the horizontal skyline of the District so as to maintain and enhance the physical image and character of the ward and the city 6) Protect areas of strong architectural character and to ensure that the architecture of new development in these areas is complementary to the ward’s and the city’s existing architectural character 7) Encourage new development in areas with vacant or underused land to secure a strong, positive physical identity 8) Coordinate and strengthen the design function and image of commercial corridors that serve neighborhood centers 9) Implement measures to ensure that master plans, project plans, public facilities, capital improvements and administrative regulations are consistent with the policies of the Urban Design Element of the Comprehensive Plan 10} Protect and preserve the desirable qualities of the ward’s established residential neighborhoods. t’(ll) Focus special design consideration at and around the Anacostia and Congress Heights Metrorail stations and the Saint Elizabeth Hospital West Campus to add to the ward’s unique identity. 366 ENROLLED ORIGINAL "SEC. 1200.818 WARD 8 ACTIONS IN SUPPORT OF URBAN DESIGN "The policies in support of urban design are as follows I) Ensure that new residential and nonresidential development proposed for Ward 8 will be architecturally compatible with the highest quality of existing development in the ward A) Ward 8 contains a number of developed areas with a distinct and attractive physical/architectural character. These include: Barry Far~n (renovated public housing Congress Heights (single-family residential areas and some renovated multi-family complexes Bellview (single-family residential areas and some renovated multi-family residential complexes Shipley Terrace (single-family residential areas and some renovated multi-family residential complexes and Washington Highlands (single-family residential areas B) Recommended actions i) Encourage increased design quality in all development projects reviewed through the planned unit development (PUD R-5-A zone site review and Large Tract Review processes by requiring compatible designs and landscaping ii) Develop a text amendment to the Zoning Regulations which would minimize, on a city wide basis, the impacts from incompatible uses where residential communities adjoin Production and Technical Employment (PTE) areas iii) Develop and implement commercial facade guidelines for commercial districts in Ward 8 2) Encourage developers of new residential or nonresidential projects to incorporate design features that respect the ward’s fragile, yet beautiful, natural environment A) Areas where development is strongly influenced by the ward’s natural beauty, and where development should be sensitive to environmental constraints include: Oxon Run Creek and Parkway; Shepherd Parkway (bordering 1-295 Saint Elizabeth Hospital; Buena Vista; Congress Heights; Bellview; and Washington Highlands B) Recommended actions i) Establish clear guidelines for planed unit development, R-5-A zone review and Large Tract Review procedures so that those reviews are effective in ensuring appropriate development on sites that are steeply sloped, poorly drained and/or identified by the city as suffering from unstable soil conditions ii) Continue to implement the current zoning requirement for site review of proposed single-family townhouse projects on R-5-A zoned properties SEC. 1200.819 WARD 8 PRESERVATION AND HISTORIC FEATURES a) Ward 8 contains a number of historic resources. These include several existing and former historic sites such as Saint Elizabeth Hospital, several Civil War fort sites (part of the city’s Fort Circle Parks system several roads which date back to colonial and early post-revolutionary times and the former Tobias Henson Estate (acquired by the federal government for the construction of Camp Simms during the 1940s Neighborhoods in the ward with historic significance include Barry Farm and Congress Heights. 367 ENROLLED ORIGINAL b) While official designation of historic resources in Ward 8 currently lags behind other areas, the amount of surveying that has been done to identify such resources is comparable to that done in the other outlying wards (wards 3, 4, 5 and 7 Neighborhood historic resource surveys were completed for Barry Farm and Congress Heights during 1988 and 1989, and the Historic Preservation Division of the Department of Consumer and Regulatory Affairs has proposed to survey other historic areas of the ward, including Saint Elizabeth Hospital and the former Henson Estate (now Camp Simms SEC. 1200.820 WARD 8 OBJECTIVES FOR PRESERVATION AND HISTOItIC FEATURES "The objectives for preservation and historic features are 1) Increase local awareness of the ward’s historic resources among residents and visitors 2) Ensure designation, protection and enhancement of the ward’s historic resources 3) Explore using the National Trust for Historic Preservation’s "Main Street" program as a means of revitalizing local neighborhood and multi-neighborhood commercial centers 4) Seek ways to provide regulatory, technical and financial assistance to owners to ensure the retention of historic properties and sites SEC. 1200.821 WARD 8 ACTIONS IN SUPPORT OF PI~ESERVATION AND HISTORIC FEATURES "The policies in support of preservation and historic features are as follows 1) Conduct a historical survey to identify and catalog the historic buildings or areas in Ward 8 A) Ward 8 contains a number of designated and potential historic sites and neighborhoods within its borders.

Notable examples include: Barry Farm; Congress Heights; and Bellview B) l~ecommended actions i) Identify areas within Ward 8 that might be eligible for Historic District or Landmark status (based on historic resource surveys like those mentioned under Priority No. 1 ii) Develop a set of proposed preservation tax incentives (including tax credits for rehabilitation of historic structures) that can be enacted by the Council of the District of Columbia iii) Enact preservation tax incentives that will encourage the restoration and preservation of privately owned historic properties in the District, including Ward 8 SEC. 1200.822 WARD 8 HUMAN SERVICES a) There are a number of public and private facilities in Ward 8 that provide a variety of social, economic and health support services to its residents. The better-known of these facilities include Saint Elizabeth, Hadley Memorial and Greater Southeast Community hospitals. Other facilities include a number of community health clinics, recreation centers and day care centers. A private non-profit service provider, the Senior Citizens Counseling &amp;amp; Delivery Service provides a variety of day care services for elderly residents of the ward, and a number of day care centers provide for the needs of very young residents. In addition, the D.C. Office on Aging is proposing to construct a free-standing senior citizens multi-purpose center at Martin Luther King, Jr. Avenue and Savannah Street S.E b) Although Ward 8 has a large number of human service facilities, there are areas in the ward that are not adequately served by these facilities or where residents lack knowledge of or access to them. In addition, the ward suffers from a shortage of public health clinics and child care facilities. Specified problems that should be a primary focus include diseases, pre- and post-natal care, drug use and abuse, teenage pregnancy, infant mortality and mental health c) The problem of drug abuse is related to another serious problem affecting Ward 8, namely, drug-related crime. The Metropolitan Police Department is cooperating with federal law enforcement officials to reduce the level of drug-related crime in Ward 8 and other affected parts of the District. These anti-crime activities are being carried out, in part, under the federal government’s War on Drugs SEC. 1200.823 WAleD 8 OBJECTIVES FOI~ HUMAN SEI~VICES "The objectives for human services are 1) Promote expanded and accessible quality primary care services 2) Provide information to the community on health and social services offered by the District 3) Expand the deinstitutionalization process of mental health clients who require less restrictive care to help them become more socially and financially independent rather than become homeless "street people 4) Increase services for the disabled and elderly. 369 ENROLLED ORIGINAL 5) Improve the overall human services delivery system within the ward 6) Reduce and eventually eliminate crime and its environmental and economic causes in Ward 8 SEC. 1200.824 WARD 8 ACTIONS IN SUPPORT OF HUMAN SERVICES "The policies in support of human services are as follows 1) Increase the availability and accessibility of community-based health clinics within Ward 8 to improve the level of walk-in health care available to ward residents A) Ward 8 contains only three city-operated community health clinics at two separate locations.

Village tract Another former federal property, the U.S. Army Radar Tract, was recently surplused and sold to a private developer for housing development d) Parks and open space, all under public ownership, are the largest public use in Ward 8 after the military installations along the ward’s shorelines. They cover about 700 acres of the ward’s land. The National Park Service maintains more than 500 acres of parkland in Ward 8 including Oxon Cove, Shepherd Parkway, Anacostia Park and sections of Oxon Run Parkway. The D.C. Department of Recreation and Parks maintains 200 acres of parkland including 10 recreation centers e) The second largest public use in Ward 8, after the military installations, is the 336-acre Saint Elizabeth Hospital tract. Less than 60 acres of this site are in active use, with the balance in undevelopable condition due, in part, to its hilly topography. Transfer of the hospital from federal to District control is expected to be completed in 1991. 371 ENROLLED ORIGINAL f) Properties owned by the District government account for 470 acres, or 12 percent of the ward’s land. Major District properties include: D.C. Village, Blue Plains Wastewater Treatment Plant, Camp Simms, Knox Hill Tract and the D.C. Tree Nursery g) l~esidential land covers about 950 acres, or about 24 percent, of the total land in Ward 8. The ward ranks fourth overall in residential population density at 78 persons per residential acre. However, its overall population density is only 19 persons per gross acre due to the preponderance of nonresidential land in the ward. It ranks sixth in overall gross population density h) More than half of Ward 8’s residential land (about 500 acres or 53 percent) is occupied by garden and walk-up apartments. Large garden and walk-up apartment complexes are located in the Douglass/Shipley Terrace, Congress Heights, Washington Highlands and Barry Farm neighborhoods i) Detached and semi-detached homes occupy 250 acres, or 26 percent, of the ward’s residential land.

Condominium conversion units are located in sites primarily in Congress Heights and Bellview, including units at the corner of Darrington Street and South Capitol Terrace, S.W. and a large development along Irvington and Joliet streets, S.W. A major example of a converted housing cooperative is the Rockburne Estates, a former rental garden apartment complex on Jasper Street S.E. adjacent to Knox Hill k) Ward 8 has the smallest amount and proportion of land occupied by commercial uses of any ward in the District. Only 36 acres, or about one percent, of the ward’s land contains such uses. More than one-half of the ward’s commercial acreage is used for retail trade. Office uses occupy only two acres. Commercial services include a limited range of convenience goods and personal services at small neighborhood centers or along the ward’s primary commercial strips l) Privately owned industrial sites occupy about four acres, or 0.1 percent of the ward’s land. The major concentration of industrial uses is along Firth Sterling Avenue S.E. and Howard Road S.E. adjacent to Barry Farm. A portion of this area along Howard Road (between 1-295 and South Capitol Street) was formerly occupied by poorly maintained walk-up apartment buildings. These have been demolished recently to make room for Metrorail construction and future development at the Anacostia Metrorail Station m) There are over 1,260 acres within Ward 8 that are classified as vacant land. Nearly all of this land is publicly owned n) The central land use issues in Ward 8 are 1) Renovate or replace blighted unused or abandoned residential and nonresidential properties to remove actual or potential locations for illegal drug activity; 372 ENROLLED ORIGINAL 2) Prevent the encroachment of nonresidential uses into stable residential areas 3) Develop an appropriate mix of uses on surplus public land that will complement existing residential and other uses 4) Change the ward’s housing mix to include a greater amount and proportion of single-family housing; and 5) Increase the amount of commercial development in the ward in ways that will minimize or avoid conflicts and negative impacts on adjacent and nearby residential uses o) Zoning. Zoning of Ward 8 land is predominantly for residential use, with small low-density commercial districts scattered throughout the ward. About 1,100 acres in Ward 8 are zoned for residential use. This is about 28 percent of the ward’s total ]and area and 73 percent of its zoned land p) Residential Zoning 1) l~esidentia] zones in the ward range from I~-I-B (low density residential) through ]~-5-B (medium-i}igh density apartments The predominant residential zone in the ward is l~-5-A (low density apartment houses This category accounts for about 82 percent of all residentially zoned ]and in the ward, or about 900 acres 2) Single-family detached and semi-detached homes occupy much of the remaining residentially zoned land in Ward 8, which is zoned ]~-2 (semi-detached single-family units 1~-2 residential districts are located generally west of Martin Luther King, Jr. Avenue S.E. and South Capitol Street in Congress Heights and BeIlview (south of Saint Elizabeth Hospital 3) Since 1987, portions of Camp Simms, Knox Hill and the former U.S. Army l~adar site have been zoned 1~-4 (rowhouse dwellings) to facilitate townhouse development at these sites q) Commercial Zoning 1) The commercial zones of Ward 8 include C-1 (neighborhood shopping C-2-A and C-2-B (community business center and C-3-A (medium bulk major business and employment center They account for about 50 acres, or just over one percent of the ward’s land area 2) C-1 commercial districts in the ward are characterized by neighborhood-serving convenience uses such as small grocery stores, carryouts, dry cleaners and beauty shops.

However, the building that housed the shops formerly located in this zone was demolished for new housing (completed in 1984) and future Metrorail construction 5) Another small C-2-A district is located along Southern Avenue S.E. near Sixth Street S.E. A U.S. Post Office and a fast-food restaurant are located in this zone. Adjacent to it is the ward’s only C-3-A district. This zone is located in the Alabama Avenue Development Zone. It is centered around the intersection of South Capitol Street and Southern Avenue S.E./District Line r) Industrial Zoning 1) There are two industrially zoned districts within Ward 8, containing a total of 350 acres of land. Both of these districts are zoned C-M-1 (low bulk commercial-light manufacturing The smaller district is located roughly in a triangle formed by Firth Sterling Avenue S.E Howard Road S.E. and South Capitol Street. It contains approximately 26 acres. The second, larger C-M-1 zone includes the D.C. Village and Blue Plains tracts. The land uses here are public, despite the area’s industrial zoning 2) More than half of Ward 8’s land is occupied by federal installations. Consequently, 62 percent of that land, or about 2,400 acres, is unzoned SEC. 1200.826 WARD 8 OBJECTIVES FOR LAND USE/ZONING "The objectives for land use/zoning are I) Encourage the effective use and rehabilitation of existing housing stock and the upgrading of nonresidential structures 2) Promote healthy and secure residential and nonresidential environments through selective renewal, rehabilitation and neighborhood revitalization programs 3) Increase employment and economic development opportunities and improve the physical condition of the ward through the provision of functional, efficient and attractive commercial, residential, industrial and open space environments 4) Minimize existing and potential conflicts between transportation facilities and adjacent land uses 5) Minimize existing and potential conflicts between residential uses and nonresidential uses 6) Locate more intensive land uses in areas of the ward which, by virtue of existing or planned infrastructure, can accommodate and support these uses 7) Promote and enhance the ward’s low density character, open spaces and stable neighborhoods 8) Increase the supply of child care facilities in residential and commercial areas within the ward 9) Relate land use decisions, as applicable, to Comprehensive Plan provisions, to revise the Zoning Regulations to reflect appropriate use changes in the ward, and to establish procedures for monitoring public and private land use actions for consistency with the Comprehensive Plan Land Use Element and accompanying plan maps. 374 EHROLLED ORIGIHAL "SEC. 1200.827 WAP~D 8 ACTIONS IN SUPPOI~T OF LAND USE/ZONING "The policies in support of land use/zoning are as follows 1) Increase the proportion of single-family mixed income housing in Ward 8 to enhance and stabilize the residential character of its neighborhoods A) Ward 8 has a concentration of public and privately owned multi-family housing.
