The Association shall perform its functions under a plan of operation established and approved under section 7 and shall exercise its powers through a board o£ directors established under section 5. For purposes of administration and assessment, the Association shall be divided into 3 separate accounts 1) The workmen’s compensation insurance account 2) The automobile insurance account; and (3) The account for all other insurance to which this act applies. Sec. 5. Board of directors a) The board of directors of the Association shall consist of not fewer than 5 nor more than 9 persons serving terms as established in the plan of operation. The members of the board shall be selected by member insurers subject to the approval of the Mayor. Vacancies on the board shall be filled for the remainder of the term by a majority vote of the remaining board members subject to the approval of the Mayor. If no members are selected within 60 days after the effective date of this act, the Mayor may appoint the initial members of the board of directors b) In approving selections to the board of directors, the Mayor shall consider among other things, whether all member insurers are fairly represented c) Members of the board of directors may be reimbursed from the assets of the Association for expenses incurred by them as members of the board of directors. New Section 35-3904 Sec. 6. Powers and duties of the Association a) The Association shall 1) Be obligated to pay covered claims existing prior to the determination of the insolvency arising within 30 days after the determination of insolvency, or before the policy expiration date if less than 30 days after the determination of insolvency, or before the insured replaces the policy or causes its cancellation, if the insured does so within 30 days of the determination. The obligation shall extend to covered claims reported pursuant to an optional extended period to report claims sold to the insured by the liquidator. The obligation as to covered claims shall be satisfied by paying to the claimant an amount as follows A) The full amount of a covered claim for benefits under a workers’ compensation insurance coverage B) An amount not exceeding $10,000 per policy for a covered claim for the return of unearned premium; or (C) An amount not exceeding $300,000 per claimant for all other covered claims.

The assessments of each member insurer shall be in the proportion that the net direct written premiums of the member insurer for the calendar year preceding the assessment on the kinds of insurance in the account bears to the net direct written premiums of all member insurers for the calendar year preceding the assessment on the kinds of insurance in the account. Each member insurer shall be notified of the assessment not later than 30 days before it is due. No member insurer may be assessed in any one year on any account an amount greater than 24 of that member insurerts net direct written premiums for the calendar year preceding the assessment on the kinds of insurance in the account.

The Association shall pay claims in any order which it deems reasonable, including the payment of claims as they are received from the claimants or in groups or categories o£ claims.

Deferred assessments shall be paid when such a payment will not reduce capital or surplus below required minimums. These payments shall be refunded to those companies receiving larger assessments by virtue of such a deferment, or at the election of any company, credited against future assessments.
