      <summary>BILL SUMMARY - As introduced Bill 25-486 would provide default rules that ensure the equitable distribution of community property when the first spouse dies. It assists courts in determining the character of property when there is a dispute between potential heirs, and among other things, also clarifies the process for partitioning and reclassifying community property for couples who agree to separate their interests. </summary>
