      <summary>BILL SUMMARY - As introduced Bill 25-571 would require at least two teachers or administrators at DCPS, public charter, and private schools be trained in seizure recognition and administering emergency seizure medication.  It would ensure students with epilepsy and other seizure disorders have individualized Seizure Action Plans included in their school files, and that the plans are available to personnel responsible for the students. It would require schools to provide epilepsy and seizure awareness training and provide protection from liability for school employees who are tasked with providing emergency seizure first aid to students under the legislation. </summary>
