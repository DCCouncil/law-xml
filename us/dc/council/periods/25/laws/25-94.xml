      <summary>BILL SUMMARY - As introduced Bill 25-68 would remove criminal penalties for a violation of the Vending Regulations Act of 2009.  It would allow the Mayor to establish sidewalk vending zones for sidewalk vendors to legally operate. Among other things, it would waive unpaid licensing-related civil citations for sidewalk vendors who obtain a sidewalk vending zone individual license or registers with a sidewalk vending zone manager. </summary>
