      <summary>BILL SUMMARY - As introduced Bill 25-152 would require the Commissioner of the Department of Insurance, Securities, and Banking to establish, by a time certain, a slavery era database of records relating to slaveholding. Among other things the legislation would establish a Reparations Task Force to study and develop reparation proposals for African Americans directly wronged and traumatized by the ills of slavery, Jim Crow, and structural and institutional racism. </summary>
