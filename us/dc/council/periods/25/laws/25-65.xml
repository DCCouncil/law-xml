      <summary>BILL SUMMARY - As introduced Bill 25-74 would clarify that landlords may not charge over a certain amount for fees associated with processing applications for rental housing and raises the notice period for rent increases from 30 days to 60 days.  It retains the landlord’s ability to withhold a security deposit for the replacement value of items a tenant may have damaged during their lease but prohibits charging new or departing tenants with fees associated with maintaining the implied warranty of habitability in a unit. </summary>
