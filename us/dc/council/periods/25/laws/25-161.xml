      <summary>BILL SUMMARY - As introduced Bill 25-425 would establish an additional regime for suspending driving privileges and immobilizing (i.e., booting or towing and impounding) motor vehicles based on traffic tickets accumulated over any consecutive six-month period, regardless of whether the fine for the ticket is paid or unpaid. It would also empower the Attorney General for the District of Columbia to bring civil suits against offending drivers or their motor vehicles. It would require that the DMV create a safe driving course that drivers must complete prior to the reinstatement of their driving privileges or the release of their vehicle from impoundment. Among other things, it would require that a judge order the suspension of a defendant’s driving privileges while any charge of negligent vehicular homicide is pending, and upon conviction of three DUI offenses within 5 years.  </summary>
