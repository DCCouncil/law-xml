      <summary>BILL SUMMARY - As introduced Bill 25-319 would allow withdrawal without prejudice of certain administrative complaints of unlawful discrimination by the District government.  It clarifies that certain complaints may be entitled to compensatory damages and reasonable attorney’s fees.  It also permits withdrawal without prejudice of administrative complaints against private parties at any time.  It permits civil actions that are not limited by proceedings before or findings of the Office of Human Rights or Commission on Human Rights.  It also allows the Commission on Human Rights to award punitive damages. </summary>
