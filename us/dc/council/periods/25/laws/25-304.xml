      <summary>BILL SUMMARY - As introduced Bill 25-692 would broaden the pool of qualified healthcare professionals authorized to initiate involuntary commitment processes, incorporating Psychiatric-Mental Health Nurse Practitioners with expertise in mental health assessments. It extends the detention time for emergency observation. It extends timeframes for initiation of probable cause hearings and prioritizes virtual hearings. It clarifies the right to voluntarily agree to remain in inpatient status until an appropriate discharge plan is implemented. It would allow doctors to make involuntary admissions, provided their financial arrangements comply with federal law. It allows the court, when appropriate to order for treatment for up to 30 days but not less than 15 days.  It would also require the Department of Behavioral Health to develop online training modules for both healthcare professionals and laypersons. </summary>
