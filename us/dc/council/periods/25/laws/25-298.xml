      <summary>BILL SUMMARY - As introduced, Bill 25-225 would provide rules that allow a settlor to freely structure a directed trust while preserving fiduciary safeguards for beneficiaries. It would provide default rules for information sharing among trustees and trust directors.  It also would provide procedures for accepting appointment as a trust director, and establishes the distinction between a power of direction and a nonfiduciary power of appointment. </summary>
