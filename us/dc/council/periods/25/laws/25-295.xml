    <b>INITIATIVE MEASURE</b>

  <text>
    <b>SHORT TITLE</b>
  </text>
  <text>Ranked Choice Voting and Open the Primary Elections to Independent Voters Act of 2024</text>
  <text>
    <b>SUMMARY STATEMENT</b>
  </text>
  <text>If enacted, the Initiative would both:
       (a)	implement ranked choice voting to allow voters to rank up to five candidates according to their preference in each contest for any office (other than political party offices); and
       (b)	permit any voter who is not registered with a political party to vote in the primary election of that voter’s choosing for all offices (other than political party offices).
      This Initiative will not be implemented unless the D.C. Council separately chooses to appropriate funds for the projected costs.</text>
