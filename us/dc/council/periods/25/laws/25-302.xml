      <summary>BILL SUMMARY - As introduced Bill 25-538 would streamline the appointment of representatives for deceased people’s estates. It would reduce the publication requirement for Notice of Probate. It would create an electronic will registry and expand the number of estates that qualify as “small estates”. Among other things it would increase the allowable reimbursement rates for funeral expenses and also increase the Homestead, Family, and Exempt Property Allowance. </summary>
