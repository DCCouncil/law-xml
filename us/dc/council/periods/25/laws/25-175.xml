      <summary>BILL SUMMARY - As introduced Bill 25-345 would eliminate or extend the length of statutes of limitations for certain serious crimes. It would make misdemeanor arrest warrants extraditable and also clarify that GPS records in the possession of the Pretrial Services Agency can be admissible to prove a defendant’s guilt in a criminal case or other judicial proceeding. It would enhance protections for seniors and children and also increase protections for victims of sexual and domestic violence.</summary>
