      <summary>BILL SUMMARY - As introduced Bill 25-750 would set soundproofing standards for new residential construction on mixed-use corridors and entertainment districts, with higher requirements for buildings within 300 feet of a performance venue.  It would also, for existing buildings, require a new disclosure on lease or purchase agreements for residential properties in an entertainment or activity area that informs a new renter or buyer of nearby activity and long-established cultural institutions. </summary>
