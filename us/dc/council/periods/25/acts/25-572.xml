  <heading type="long">To amend, on an emergency basis, section 8f of the Homeless Services Reform Act of 2005 to reform the Emergency Rental Assistance Program to require specific documentation from tenants establishing eligibility for emergency rental assistance funds and to clarify the definition of a qualifying emergency situation; and to amend section 501 of the Rental Housing Act of 1985 to permit a court to enter a stay, rather than require a court to enter a stay, when a tenant submits documentation to the court demonstrating that he or she has a pending Emergency Rental Assistance Program application.</heading>
