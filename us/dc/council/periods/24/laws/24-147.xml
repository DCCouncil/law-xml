        The Editor has interpreted the amendment to this section by section 151 of D.C. Law 24-147 as a correction to the citation of the organic act (Bill 22-250) and not a removal of the reference to § 16-909(e)(1)(A). Therefore the citation to "section 108(l)(6) of the Vital Records Modernization Amendment Act of 2018, passed on 3rd reading on July 10, 2018 (Enrolled version of Bill 22-250)" has been changed to "§ 7-231.08(l)(6))" since this section (16-2345) is within an enacted title of the D.C.
