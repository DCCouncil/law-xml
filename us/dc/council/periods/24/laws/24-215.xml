      <summary>BILL SUMMARY - As introduced Bill 24-706 would allow the Board of Ethics and Government Accountability (“BEGA”) to retain funds resulting from ethics and open meetings violations under its jurisdiction. It would allow the Central Collection Unit (“CCU”) to collect delinquent debt on BEGA’s behalf and deposit the funds into the Ethics Fund or the Open Government Fund, instead of the General Fund. The delinquent debt that is recovered and transferred to BEGA will supplement the agency’s operating budget by providing additional special purposes revenue to support its operations and personnel.  </summary>
