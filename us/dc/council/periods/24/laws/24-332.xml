      <summary>BILL SUMMARY - As introduced, Bill 24-113 would allow qualifying patients to obtain their medical cannabis and medical cannabis products from any dispensary registered in the District. Dispensaries would operate safe use treatment facilities as well as offer tastings and demonstrations and/or classes with the proper endorsements.  It would allow delivery and curbside pickup services by dispensaries. It eliminates the count on the number of plants that a cultivation center can grow and increases the number of permitted dispensaries in the District. Among other things it removes certain prohibitions against returning citizens ability to take part in the medical marijuana industry. </summary>
