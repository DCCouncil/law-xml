  <heading type="short">Paternity Establishment Amendment Act of 2022</heading>
  <heading type="long">To amend Title 16 of the District of Columbia Official Code to eliminate a conclusive presumption of paternity established by an acknowledgement of paternity made in the District where it is proven that all the statutory requirements for the acknowledgement were not fully met, to explicitly allow a paternity acknowledgement or determination made in the District to be challenged in Superior Court based on fraud, duress, or material mistake of fact, to provide that Court-ordered DNA test results excluding the parentage of a person whose paternity has been established by acknowledgement or adjudication or proving to a scientific certainty that another person is the father of a child shall constitute evidence of fraud, duress, or material mistake of fact which shall require the Court to set aside the acknowledgement or determination, to allow additional parties to request the Court require medical or genetic testing, to eliminate the bar on the Court from ordering such medical or genetic testing when there is a signed acknowledgement of paternity that has not been legally rescinded, to allow the Court to order the District to pay testing costs if the alleged parent does not have sufficient resources, and to make conforming amendments.</heading>
