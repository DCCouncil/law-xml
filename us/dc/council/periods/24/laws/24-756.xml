      <summary>BILL SUMMARY - As introduced Bill 24-857 would provide local funding for the cost of care of foster and disabled children to enable these children to leave care with their social security benefits still available. It requires CFSA to conserve children’s benefits in accounts that avoid transgressing federal resource limitations, creating a nest egg for when children leave care.</summary>
