      <summary>BILL SUMMARY - As introduced Bill 24-712 would require written agreements when a hiring entity employs a domestic worker.  Among other things, it requires that certain information be posted on line and that administrative procedures for complaints be specified. It requires certain educational materials and outreach be provided to domestic workers and eliminates the exclusion of domestic workers from the protections of the DC Human Rights Act as well as the Occupational Safety and Health Act. It also specifies the powers of the Attorney General and the Mayor to enforce the law. </summary>
