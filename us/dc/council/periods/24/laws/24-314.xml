      <summary>RACIAL EQUITY ANALYSIS - This bill will harm economic outcomes for Black, Indigenous, and Latinx residents. The Solar for All program and additional utility assistance programs are not enough to offset the bill’s harmful economic impacts on Black, Indigenous, and other residents of color. It will have an inconclusive impact on Black, Latinx, and other solar workers of color. </summary>
