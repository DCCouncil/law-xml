                  <strong>&quot;TENANT'S DECLARATION OF ECONOMIC OR MEDICAL HARDSHIP DURING THE COVID-19 PANDEMIC.</strong>
                </text>
                <text>&quot;I am a tenant, lawful occupant, or other person responsible for paying rent, use and occupancy, or any other financial obligation under a lease or tenancy agreement at (address of dwelling unit):</text>
                <text>
                  <strong>&quot;YOU MUST INDICATE BELOW YOUR QUALIFICATION FOR EVICTION PROTECTION BY SELECTING ONE MORE OF THE OPTIONS BELOW</strong>
                </text>
                <text>&quot;I am experiencing financial or medical hardship, and I am unable to pay my rent or other financial obligations under the lease in full or obtain alternative suitable permanent housing because of one or more of the following:</text>
                <text>&quot;☐ My income is below 40 percent of area median income, based on the chart below.</text>
                <text>&quot;☐ I am currently or during the COVID-19 covered period was eligible for cash assistance, supplemental nutrition assistance program (food stamps), supplemental security income (SSI), Medicaid or DC Healthcare Alliance, or unemployment insurance or benefits.</text>
                <text>&quot;☐ Vacating my home and moving into new permanent housing would pose a significant health risk because myself and/or one or more members of my household have an increased risk for severe illness or death from COVID-19 due to being over the age of sixty-five, having a disability or having an underlying medical condition, which may include but is not limited to being immunocompromised.</text>
                <text>&quot;To the extent that I have lost household income or had increased expenses, any additional public assistance that I have received since the start of the COVID-19 pandemic did not fully make up for my loss of household income or increased expenses.</text>
                <text>&quot;I understand that I must comply with all other lawful terms under my tenancy, lease agreement, or similar contract. I further understand that lawful fees, penalties, or interest for not having paid rent in full or met other financial obligations as required by my tenancy, lease agreement, or similar contract may still be charged or collected and may result in a monetary judgment against me. I further understand that my landlord may be able to seek eviction and that the law may provide certain protections at that time that are separate from those available through this declaration.</text>
