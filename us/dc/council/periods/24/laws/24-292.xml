      <summary>BILL SUMMARY - As introduced, Bill 24-228 would require restaurants and third-party meal delivery platforms to enter into an express agreement that would authorize third-party meal delivery platforms to collect meal orders and deliver meals to customers as well as prohibit a third-party meal delivery platform from advertising or marketing contact information, image, or likeness of a restaurant on its platform. It requires DCRA to provide enforcement. </summary>
