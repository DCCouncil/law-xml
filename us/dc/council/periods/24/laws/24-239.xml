      <summary>BILL SUMMARY - As introduced, Bill 24-156 establishes protections against problems arising from the inheritance of real property by family members where the deceased owners did not have a will by establishing remedies for use in those partition actions involving heirs property. The remedies are designed to help those who own heirs property as tenants in common to maintain ownership of their property when possible or to ensure at the very least that any court-ordered sale of the property is conducted under commercially reasonable circumstances that will protect the owners from losing substantial wealth upon the sale of their property.</summary>
