      <summary>BILL SUMMARY - As introduced, Bill 24-169  would clarify that property held by tenants by the entirety, at the time a joint revocable trust is created, retains protections from judgments against one of the spouses or domestic partners. The legislation also clarifies that these protections extend to the sales of any such assets.</summary>
