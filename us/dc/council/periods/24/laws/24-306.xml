      <summary>BILL SUMMARY - As introduced Bill 24-785 would require that construction of new or substantially improved buildings that the District owns or finances adhere to net zero energy standards and not incorporate fossil fuel consumption. It would codify the Sustainability and Energy Division of the Department of General Services (DGS). It requires DGS to procure periodic net zero energy construction and maintenance training for facilities staff, certified business enterprises, and interested parties. Among other things it would give net zero energy ready, fossil fuel free buildings priority consideration for the District government’s  facility needs.  </summary>
