      <summary>BILL SUMMARY - As introduced Bill 24-760 would provide more precise language to clarify that it remains unlawful to sell unserialized items that meet the definition of a firearm. It also clarifies that noncompliance with District law regarding the transportation of firearms is a criminal offense. Among other things it authorizes and limits the carrying of pistols by off duty law enforcement officers, other US officers and employees while on duty, manufacturers, and those transporting firearms for limited purposes.</summary>
