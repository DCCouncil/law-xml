It would authorize animal control vehicles to operate emergency lights and sirens when responding to life threatening emergencies. It allows the Washington Humane Society to recover costs incurred boarding animals during a pending criminal or other proceeding. It would ban dogfighting tools and equipment, sexual contact with animals, and cat declawing. The legislation also requires pet stores to sell rescued animals and addresses pet ownership in divorce. </summary>
