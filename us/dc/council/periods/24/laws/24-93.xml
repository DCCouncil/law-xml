      <summary>BILL SUMMARY - As introduced Bill 24-0018 requires the Department of Energy &amp; Environment (DOEE) to adopt a methodology for estimating greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions that occur through the life cycle of foods and beverages, and provide purchasing guidance to District agencies on how to mitigate these emissions. Agencies would be required to quantify emissions from their food purchases and take steps to reduce these emissions by 25% by 2030. The legislation also requires DOEE to prepare a report with recommendations for other procurement options that could be targeted to lower greenhouse gas emissions and recommendations to more quickly achieve reduction goals. </summary>
