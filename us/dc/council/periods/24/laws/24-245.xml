      <summary>BILL SUMMARY - As introduced Bill 24-455 would require an athlete agent to notify the school at which a student athlete is enrolled before contacting the athlete and give the student athlete a right of legal action against an athlete agent. It would also, among other things, expand the definition of “athlete agent”, provide for reciprocal registration of agents licensed in other states and enhance the requirements for a student athlete to sign an agency contract.</summary>
