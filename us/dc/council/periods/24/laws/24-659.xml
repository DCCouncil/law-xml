      <summary>BILL SUMMARY - As introduced, Bill 24-142 would establish bed bug inspection requirements for contiguous units and establish a timeline for abatement. It requires landlords to provide the bedbug infestation history for the previous 16 months to a prospective tenant and also require landlords and licensed pest control professionals to report bedbug infestations abatement to DCRA. Among other things it creates the Bedbug Remediation Assistance Program to provide financial assistance for bedbug infestation abatement for low income homeowners. </summary>
