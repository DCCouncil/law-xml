    <text>Each month the Mayor of the District of Columbia shall determine the per centum change in the price index. On the basis of this determination, and effective the 1st day of the 3rd month which begins after the price index shall have equaled the rise of at least 3% for 3 consecutive months over the price index for the base month, each annuity payable under this subchapter which: (1) is payable to a survivor of a member who was an officer or member of the United States Park Police force, the United States Secret Service Uniformed Division or the United States Secret Service Division; and (2) has a commencing date on or before such effective date shall be increased by 1% plus the per centum rise in the price index. For purposes of this subsection, the term “base month” means the month for which the price index showed a per centum rise forming the basis for a cost-of-living annuity increase under this subsection, except that, until the 1st cost-of-living annuity increase under this subsection, the base month shall be the last month which was the base month for purposes of <cite path="§5-716">§ 5-716</cite>.</text>
