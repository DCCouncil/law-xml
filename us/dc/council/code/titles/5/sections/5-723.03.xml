The provisions of this section shall apply for the purposes of determining minimum required distributions under section 401(a)(9) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 and take precedence over any inconsistent provisions of this subchapter; provided, that these provisions are intended solely to reflect the requirements of section 401(a)(9) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 and accompanying Treasury regulations and are not intended to provide or expand, and shall not be construed as providing or expanding, a benefit or distribution option not otherwise expressly provided for under the terms of this subchapter.
