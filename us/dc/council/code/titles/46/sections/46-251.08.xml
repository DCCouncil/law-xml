    <text>If an employer is required to withhold earnings or employee contributions for health insurance coverage pursuant to more than one support order, the employer shall prorate among the support orders subject to withholding the amount of the employee’s earnings that are available for withholding within the limits of section 303(b) of the Consumer Credit Protection Act, approved May 29, 1968 (82 Stat. 163; 15 U.S.C. § 1673(b)), and determine whether the available earnings are sufficient to satisfy current cash support due under all applicable support orders. The employer shall not withhold contributions for health insurance coverage required under any support order until all the employee’s current cash support obligations are satisfied. The employer shall fully satisfy each priority level stated in subsection (a) of this section for all of the employee’s support orders before applying payments to an obligation with a lesser priority.</text>
