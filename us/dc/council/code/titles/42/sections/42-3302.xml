    <text>Wherever an owner, agent, lessor or manager of an apartment house is billed directly by a company, electricity supplier, natural gas supplier, or gas company (any of which shall be referred to as “company”) for service furnished to such apartment house not occupied exclusively by such owner, agent, lessor or manager, and such company has actual or constructive knowledge that the tenants of such apartment house are not the persons to whom the company sends its bills, such company shall not terminate such service for nonpayment of a delinquent account owed to such company by such owner, agent, lessor or manager unless such company provides an opportunity, where practicable, for such tenants to receive service in their own names, either individually or collectively, without any liability for the amount due while service was billed directly to the lessor, owner, agent or manager. Security deposits or guarantees of payment may only be required as provided in part V of the Consumer Bill of Rights, Public Service Commission of the District of Columbia Order No. 6084 (15 DCMR 307) and the Public Service Commission of the District of Columbia Formal Case No. 760 (15 DCMR 409); provided, however, if it is not practicable for such tenants to receive service in their own names, the company shall not terminate service to such apartment house but may pursue the remedy provided in <cite path="§42-3303">§ 42-3303</cite>.</text>
