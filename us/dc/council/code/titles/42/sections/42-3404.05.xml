    <heading>Reduced price. —</heading>
    <text>If the owner sells or contracts to sell the accommodation to a third party for a price more than 10% less than the price offered to the tenant or for other terms which would constitute bargaining without good faith, the owner shall comply anew with all requirements of §§ <cite path="§42-3404.09">42-3404.09</cite>, <cite path="§42-3404.10">42-3404.10</cite>, and <cite path="§42-3404.11">42-3404.11</cite>, as applicable.</text>

    <heading>Financial assurances. —</heading>
    <text>The owner may not require the tenant to prove financial ability to perform as a prerequisite to entering into a contract. The owner may not require the tenant to pay the purchase price in installments unless the owner provides deferred purchase money financing on terms reasonably acceptable to the tenant. The owner may require the tenant to prove that the tenant, either alone or in conjunction with a third party, has comparable financial ability to the third-party contractor before the owner will be required to grant deferred purchase money financing to the tenant on the same terms and conditions agreed between the owner and the third-party contractor. If the tenant can prove comparable financial ability alone, the owner may not require the tenant to secure a third-party guarantor. This proof cannot be required as a prerequisite to contracting. It may be required only as a prerequisite to the owner granting deferred purchase money financing at settlement.</text>

With respect to either type of offer, all provisions of this subchapter apply.</text>
