  <text>In addition to equitable relief granted under this chapter, the plaintiff may request, and the court in its discretion may order damages for each day the drug-, firearm-, or prostitution-related nuisance is unabated since the date the defendant first received notice of the drug-, firearm-, or prostitution-related nuisance as provided in <cite path="§42-3103">§ 42-3103</cite>, or knew or should have known of the existence of the drug-, firearm-, or prostitution-related nuisance, whichever is earlier.
