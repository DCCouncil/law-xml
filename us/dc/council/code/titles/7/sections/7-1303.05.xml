  <heading>Application by parent or guardian for nonresidential habilitation.</heading>
  <text>Any parent or guardian may apply on behalf of an individual under 14 years of age who is or is believed to have an intellectual disability to any hospital, clinic, facility or community-based service owned or operated by, or under contract with, the District for nonresidential habilitation. Applications shall be made to the Director of the hospital, clinic, or service, or to the Department on Disability Services. If an application is filed with a Director and the Director determines that the particular hospital, clinic, facility or community-based service cannot provide the necessary habilitation, he or she shall refer the parent or guardian to the Department on Disability Services, and the Department on Disability Services shall assist the parent or guardian in locating a facility, hospital, clinic or service which can provide the required habilitation.</text>
