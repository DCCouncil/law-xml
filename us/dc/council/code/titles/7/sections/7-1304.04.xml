  <heading>Payment for independent comprehensive evaluation and habilitation plan.</heading>
  <text>If the respondent demonstrates that a comprehensive evaluation of a person with an intellectual disability failed to comply substantially with accepted professional standards and that sound professional judgment was not exercised in the performance of the evaluation, the court, upon a motion of the respondent, may order an independent comprehensive evaluation of the person or an individual habilitation plan at the District’s expense if the person is unable to pay.</text>
