      <text>Any person who is aggrieved by a violation of this chapter, or who is acting on or in behalf of a person aggrieved by a violation of this chapter, may maintain an action in court to enjoin the continuation of that violation or the commission of any future violation. In any such action that challenges the adequacy of protective services provided under <cite path="§7-1905|(a)">§ 7-1905(a)</cite>, the court may direct the Mayor to provide additional or different services only upon a finding of bad-faith noncompliance.

Actions brought under this paragraph shall, commensurate with the exigency of the circumstances alleged, be expedited pursuant to procedures to be established by the court.</text>
