    <text>A person with an intellectual disability, or the father, mother, spouse, or adult child of a person with an intellectual disability, who receives habilitation, care, or both from the District pursuant to this chapter, shall pay to the District the costs of habilitation, care, or both received by the person with an intellectual disability if the person with an intellectual disability, or the father, mother, spouse, or adult child of the person with an intellectual disability, or the estate of the person with an intellectual disability is able to pay the costs of habilitation, care, or both received.</text>

    <text>If any person made liable by subsection (a) of this section does not pay the costs of habilitation, care, or both received by the person with an intellectual disability, the court shall issue to the liable person a citation to show cause why that person should not be adjudged to pay a portion or all of the expenses of habilitation, care, or both of the person with an intellectual disability. The citation shall be served at least 10 days before the show cause hearing. If, upon the hearing, it appears to the court that the person made liable by subsection (a) of this section does not have sufficient resources to pay the full costs of habilitation, care, or both received by the person with an intellectual disability, the court may order the payment of a reasonable amount of the costs of habilitation, care, or both received based on the liable person’s resources. The court may order the liable person to make payments quarterly, monthly, or at any other interval deemed appropriate by the court. The order may be enforced against any property of the liable person as if the order were an order for temporary alimony in a divorce case.</text>
