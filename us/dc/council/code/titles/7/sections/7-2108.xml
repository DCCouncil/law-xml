      <text>The Mayor may, before holding a hearing, suspend the license of a facility or convert its license to a provisional or restricted license if he or she determines that existing deficiencies constitute an immediate or serious and continuing danger to the health, safety, or welfare of its residents. The Mayor shall immediately give the facility written notice of the suspension or conversion, including a statement of the grounds for the action and notification that the facility has 7 days (excluding Saturdays, Sundays, and legal holidays) from the day notice is received to request an expedited, preliminary review hearing. If the facility fails to communicate, either orally or in writing, a timely request for a preliminary review hearing, the order of suspension or conversion shall remain in effect until terminated by the Mayor or an unexpedited hearing is held pursuant to procedures adopted under <cite path="§7-2103|(a)|(1)">§ 7-2103(a)(1)</cite>.</text>
