  <heading>Public Health Laboratory fees.</heading>
  <text>The Mayor is authorized to establish a schedule of fees for forms and for performing laboratory analysis of biological and environmental samples obtained from humans, animals, or various environmental media for the purpose of identifying environmental contaminants and performing epidemiological surveillance, including for cases of lead poisoning, tuberculosis, rabies, and sexually transmitted diseases. The schedule of fees may account for the provision of bulk services and may distinguish between services provided to individuals and organizations. The schedule of fees may be developed on a sliding scale based on a person’s or organization’s ability to pay for laboratory analysis, or may be waived in cases of extreme need.</text>
