The Court may appoint a new fiduciary to replace the successor fiduciary if it finds, after notice to all parties in interest and a hearing, that the successor fiduciary will adversely affect the administration of the fiduciary account and that the appointment of a new fiduciary will be in the best interest of the petitioner and all interested parties. This provision shall be in addition to any other provision of law governing the removal of a fiduciary and shall be subject to the terms upon which the original fiduciary was designated as fiduciary.</text>
