    <text>Service of process in a suit, action, or proceeding, or service of a notice or demand required or permitted by law to be served on an international banking corporation, may be made on a licensed international banking corporation by serving the registered agent of the international banking corporation. If a licensed international banking corporation fails to appoint or maintain a registered agent upon whom legal process or a notice or demand may be served, the registered agent cannot with reasonable diligence be found at the registered office of the international banking corporation, or the license of an international banking corporation is revoked, the Commissioner shall be irrevocably authorized as the agent and representative of the international banking corporation to accept service of process or a notice or demand required or permitted by law to be served on the international banking corporation. Service on the Commissioner of any process, notice, or demand for the international banking corporation shall be made by delivering to and leaving with the Commissioner, or with any official having charge of the Department, duplicate copies of the process, notice, or demand. If any process, notice, or demand is served on the Commissioner, the Commissioner shall immediately forward a copy by registered mail to the international banking corporation at its principal office as the same appears on the Department’s records. Nothing in this chapter shall limit or affect the right to serve any process, notice, or demand required or permitted by law to be served upon a foreign corporation in any other manner now or hereafter permitted by law. The Commissioner shall keep a record of all process, notices, and demands served upon the Commissioner under this section, setting forth the time of service and the Commissioner’s action on the service.</text>
