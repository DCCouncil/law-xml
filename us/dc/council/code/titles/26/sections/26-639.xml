      <text>Except to the extent they are inconsistent with this chapter, the provisions of the District of Columbia Banking Code shall apply to the loans and investments made by an international bank agency or international branch of the international banking corporation. With respect to an international banking corporation and its international bank agencies or international branches, a reference in those provisions to capital, capital account, or similar terms shall refer to the capital account of the international banking corporation, and, except when used with reference to the capital account, a reference in those provisions to the term “bank” shall refer to the international agencies and branches of the international banking corporation which are licensed in the District of Columbia.</text>
