        <text>The Commissioner may, at the Commissioner’s discretion, take possession of the business and property in the District of Columbia of a international banking corporation that has been licensed to operate in the District of Columbia upon finding that (i) the corporation’s international branch or agency operating in the District of Columbia has violated any law, (ii) has neglected or refused to comply with the terms of a duly issued order of the Commissioner, (iii) is insolvent, will imminently become insolvent, or is transacting business in an unsound, unsafe, or unauthorized manner such that the corporation is threatened with imminent insolvency, or (iv) the corporation is in liquidation at its domicile or elsewhere. Title to the business and property shall vest by operation of law in the Commissioner upon taking possession. Thereafter, the Commissioner shall liquidate or otherwise deal with such business and property in accordance with the provisions of this chapter and any other laws relating to the liquidation of banking corporations within the District of Columbia.</text>

The Commissioner may, without regard to any priorities, preferences, or adverse claims and without obtaining the approval of a court, sell the property and, as soon as practicable, distribute the proceeds to the depositors on a pro rata basis; provided, that no depositor shall receive an amount in excess of his account balance.</text>
