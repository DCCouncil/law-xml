Part 103, or (4) has made, or caused to be made in any application or report filed with the Superintendent [Commissioner] or in any proceeding before the Superintendent [Commissioner], any statement which was at the time and in the circumstances under which it was made, false or misleading with respect to any material fact, or has omitted to state in any such application or report any material fact which is required to be stated therein, the Superintendent [Commissioner] may issue an order suspending or barring the authorized delegate from continuing to be, or becoming, an authorized delegate of any licensee during the period for which the order is in effect.
