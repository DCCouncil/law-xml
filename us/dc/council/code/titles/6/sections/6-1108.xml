    <text>An applicant may apply to the Mayor for a preliminary review of a project for compliance with the provisions of this subchapter relating to new construction, and to any demolition, alteration, or subdivision necessary for such new construction. Upon the provision of such information and upon compliance with such other conditions as the Mayor may require, such application shall be considered by the Mayor without the necessity of the applicant completing other permit requirements not necessary for a finding under this subchapter. Where an application for a preliminary review is received pursuant to this section, the Mayor will determine, in accordance with the procedures and requirements specified in §§ <cite path="§6-1104">6-1104</cite>, <cite path="§6-1105">6-1105</cite>, <cite path="§6-1106">6-1106</cite>, and/or <cite path="§6-1107">6-1107</cite>, as applicable, whether to issue a preliminary finding of compliance with this subchapter; provided, that no permit shall be granted except in accordance with all other permit requirements, and after final review by the Mayor under this subchapter; provided further, that where the final review shows that the project is not consistent with the preliminary review, the application will again be processed in accordance with the procedures and requirements of §§ <cite path="§6-1104">6-1104</cite>, <cite path="§6-1105">6-1105</cite>, <cite path="§6-1106">6-1106</cite>, and/or <cite path="§6-1107">6-1107</cite>, as applicable.</text>
