  <heading>Review of order of condemnation.</heading>
  <text>The order of condemnation by the Board for the Condemnation of Insanitary Buildings may be appealed to the Superior Court of the District of Columbia for a review of the record and the Court may affirm, reverse, remove, or modify the decision, or take any other appropriate action the Court may consider necessary or appropriate. The Court shall examine the administrative record of the Board for the Condemnation of Insanitary Buildings to determine whether there has been procedural error, whether there is substantial evidence in the record to support the findings, or whether the action of the Board was in some manner arbitrary, capricious, or an abuse of discretion.</text>

    <annotation type="Change in Government">This section originated at a time when local government powers were delegated to a Board of Commissioners of the District of Columbia (see Acts Relating to the Establishment of the District of Columbia and its Various Forms of Governmental Organization in Volume 1). Section 401 of Reorganization Plan No. 3 of 1967 (see Reorganization Plans in Volume 1) transferred all of the functions of the Board of Commissioners under this section to a single Commissioner. The District of Columbia Self-Government and Governmental Reorganization Act, 87 Stat. 818, § 711 ( D.C. Code, <cite path="§1-207.11">§ 1-207.11</cite>), abolished the District of Columbia Council and the Office of Commissioner of the District of Columbia. These branches of government were replaced by the Council of the District of Columbia and the Office of Mayor of the District of Columbia, respectively. Accordingly, and also pursuant to § 714(a) of such Act ( D.C. Code, <cite path="§1-207.14|(a)">§ 1-207.14(a)</cite>), appropriate changes in terminology were made in this section.</annotation>
