    <text>If 50% or more children in a licensed child development facility are eligible to participate in the CACF Program, the facility shall participate in the program unless OSSE grants it an exemption pursuant to subsection (b) of this section.</text>

    <num>(b)</num>
    <text>To be eligible for an exemption, a child development facility must provide OSSE with a written statement describing why participation in the CACF Program constitutes a hardship. OSSE will determine whether good cause exists and provide notice to the child development facility that it is excused from participating in the CACF Program for one year from the date of the notice. To the extent possible, OSSE shall work with excused child development facilities to address barriers to participating in the CACF Program.</text>
