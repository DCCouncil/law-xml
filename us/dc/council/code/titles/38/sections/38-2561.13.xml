    <text>A nonpublic special education school or program may request reconsideration of a rate approved by the Mayor, or his or her designee, by the Rate Reconsideration Panel established by <cite path="§38-2561.14">§ 38-2561.14</cite>. A rate is eligible for reconsideration only for matters that relate to the ability of the nonpublic special education school or program to meet the requirements of an IEP for a student placed by a District government agency.</text>
