    <text>No student shall be excluded from school on account of his or her failure to furnish a required certificate of health, testing for lead poisoning or dental health. If a certificate of health, testing for lead poisoning or dental health is not furnished when required, the principal or other appropriate school official shall give both oral and written notice to a minor student’s parent(s) or guardian or an adult student that submission of the certificate is required by law. The notice shall explain how to contact the public health authorities for the purpose of having the student examined if private health care is not available or desired. If after 30 calendar days the student has still not furnished the required certificate of health, testing for lead poisoning or dental health, the principal or other appropriate school official shall inquire into whether the student has had an examination. If the student has not been given an examination and none is scheduled, the principal or other appropriate school official shall notify the public health authorities, who shall make prompt and, if necessary, continuing efforts to secure the consent of the parent(s), guardian, or adult student so that the student may as soon as possible be given the required examination(s) either in a public health facility or at school.</text>
