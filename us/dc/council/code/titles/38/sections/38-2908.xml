    <text>Except as provided in subsections (b) and (b-1) of this section, the fiscal year facility allowance for Public Charter Schools shall be determined as follows: DCPS approved capital budget shall be divided by the previous school year (“SY”) DCPS total pupil count, as defined in <cite path="§38-2906">§ 38-2906</cite>, to determine the DCPS per pupil facility cost.</text>

The facility allowance shall then be multiplied by the number of students estimated to be attending each Public Charter School to determine the actual facility allowance payments to be received by each Public Charter School. For each year after FY 2004, this “moving average” shall only include the most recent 5-year’s DCPS per pupil facility cost.</text>
