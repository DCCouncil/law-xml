  <heading>Participation of LEA in development or review of the IEP.</heading>
  <text>When a student is receiving education and related services from a nonpublic special education school or program that is approved by the SEA under <cite path="§38-2561.07">§ 38-2561.07</cite> and receives funding from the District of Columbia government, the LEA shall participate in the initial meeting to develop an IEP. For any subsequent meeting to review or revise the IEP, the failure or inability of the LEA representative to attend the IEP meeting after the meeting has been set shall not prevent the meeting from taking place as planned and does not negate or diminish the LEA’s obligation to provide a free and appropriate public education.</text>
