    <text>It is not the intent that any income derived as a result of such funds shall take the place of any District or federal appropriations or any part thereof but that it shall supplement such appropriations to the end that the University may improve and increase its functions, may enlarge its areas of service and may become more useful to a greater number of people. Nothing in this section shall be construed to prevent the Trustees from receiving gifts, donations, and bequests from any source and from using the same for such lawful purposes as the donor or donors designate.</text>
