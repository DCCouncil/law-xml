  <heading>Employment of retired teachers.</heading>
  <text>Notwithstanding any other provision of law, the salary of any retired teacher who first becomes entitled to an annuity under this subchapter after November 17, 1979, and who is subsequently employed by the government of the District of Columbia shall be reduced by such amount as is necessary to provide that the sum of such teacher’s annuity under <cite path="38|20|II|A">part A of subchapter II of this chapter</cite> and compensation for such employment is equal to the salary otherwise payable for the position held by such teacher. No salary subject to this reduction shall be reduced to less than any applicable minimum wage set forth in the Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938, approved June 25, 1938 (52 Stat. 1060; 29 U.S.C. § 201   et seq.), or any other applicable federal minimum wage statute or regulation.</text>
