The rule shall ensure that, subject to availability, all such purchases occurring on or after January 1, 2009 are based on the life-cycle cost methodology contained in section 2 of Standard TP 1-2002 published by the National Electrical Manufacturers Association. The Public Service Commission may also consider additional inventory management costs as costs for inclusion within the life-cycle cost methodology to be used by an electric company for purposes of this section. Except as provided herein, the rule shall be consistent with regulations pertaining to liquid-immersed distribution transformers adopted by the United States Department of Energy.</text>
