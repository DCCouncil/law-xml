The Mayor may serve the notice of violation on the owner, occupant, or any other responsible person at the premises, deliver the notice of violation by prepaid mail, return receipt requested to the owner or occupant of the property, or post the notice in a conspicuous place on the property in violation. The notice of violation shall include the following:</text>

    <text>Upon receipt of a notice of violation, the person responsible for the property shall abate the public health nuisance within the time specified in the notice of violation. The Mayor may grant additional time to abate the public health nuisance upon a request from the responsible person and a good faith showing that the person has made an effort to abate the public health nuisance and that a longer time for abatement is necessary.</text>
