    <text>The Mayor’s agent shall render a final decision on the claimant’s appeal no later than 60 days after the date of his or her initial request for a hearing. If, however, the date of the hearing is postponed at the claimant’s request, or if the claimant submits new evidence following the close of his or her hearing, causing it to be reopened, the length of the postponement or the delay caused by the reopening may be added to the 60-day period.</text>
