      <text>If the pregnant or parenting teen is exempt from the home living requirement under subsection (b) of this section, the Department shall provide or assist the pregnant or parenting teen in locating a second chance home, as defined in paragraph (2) of this subsection, a maternity home, or other appropriate adult-supervised supportive living arrangement, unless the Department determines that the pregnant or parenting teen’s current living arrangement is appropriate.
