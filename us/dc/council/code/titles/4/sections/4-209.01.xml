    <text>After determining that a person is eligible to receive public assistance, the Mayor may issue to such person a public assistance identification card which may be used by such person in obtaining any public assistance, and as a means of identifying him or her as the proper recipient of such public assistance. The public assistance identification card shall contain the name, social security number, and account or case number of the recipient to whom such card was issued.</text>

    <text>The Mayor may by rule prescribe additional uses and requirements with respect to the issuance and use of the public assistance identification card as he or she deems necessary. Nothing in this section shall be construed to require recipients of public assistance to receive their monthly allotment checks in person at 1 central location. The Mayor shall by rule establish such means of distribution of such checks which, utilizing the public assistance identification card, will insure the least amount of fraud and loss of such checks without unduly burdening the recipients of such checks.</text>
