    <text>In accordance with regulations issued by the Mayor, a pregnant or parenting teen subject to the provisions of <cite path="§4-205.63">§ 4-205.63</cite> shall be informed of the eligibility requirements and the pregnant or parenting teen’s rights and obligations. The Department shall advise the pregnant or parenting teen of the exemptions from the home living requirement as outlined in <cite path="§4-205.63|(b)">§ 4-205.63(b)</cite> and (e). The Department shall determine whether one or more of these exemptions is applicable. The Department shall also assist the pregnant or parenting teen in attaining the necessary verifications if the teen alleges one or more of the exemptions. The pregnant or parenting teen shall not be required to obtain verification or take steps that could endanger the pregnant or parenting teen’s health or safety or that of the pregnant or parenting teen’s child. The regulations shall include provisions to ensure that the pregnant or parenting teen understands his or her rights under this subchapter, the meaning of each exemption under <cite path="§4-205.63">§ 4-205.63</cite>, and is given an opportunity to speak with the Department outside of the presence of the pregnant or parenting teen’s parent, legal guardian, or other adult relative.</text>

    <text>If the pregnant or parenting teen or the pregnant or parenting teen’s parent, legal guardian, or other adult relative does not request a fair hearing pursuant to <cite path="§4-210.05">§ 4-210.05</cite>, or, if after a fair hearing has been held, the hearing officer finds that the teen is not exempt from the home living requirement and has otherwise failed to meet the requirements of <cite path="§4-205.63">§ 4-205.63</cite>, the Department shall, after providing adequate and timely notice, render the pregnant or parenting teen ineligible for TANF benefits in the next possible payment month. The pregnant or parenting teen’s ineligibility shall not affect the eligibility for TANF benefits of a child living with the pregnant or parenting teen who, if otherwise eligible, may receive TANF benefits determined without regard to the needs of the ineligible pregnant or parenting teen.</text>
