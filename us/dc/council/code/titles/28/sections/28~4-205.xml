    <annotation type="Uniform Commercial Code Comment">Section 3-201(b) provides that negotiation of an instrument payable to order requires indorsement by the holder. The rule of former  Section 4-205(1) was that the depositary bank may supply a missing indorsement of its customer unless the item contains the words “payee’s indorsement required” or the like. The cases have differed on the status of the depositary bank as a holder if it fails to supply its customer’s indorsement.  Marine Midland Bank, N.A. v. Price, Miller, Evans &amp; Flowers, 446 N.Y.S.2d 797 (N.Y.App.Div.4th Dept. 1981)455 N.Y.S.2d 565 (N.Y.1982). It is common practice for depositary banks to receive unindorsed checks under so-called “lock-box” agreements from customers who receive a high volume of checks. No function would be served by requiring a depositary bank to run these items through a machine that would supply the customer’s indorsement except to afford the drawer and the subsequent banks evidence that the proceeds of the item reached the customer’s account. Paragraph (1) provides that the depositary bank becomes a holder when it takes the item for deposit if the depositor is a holder. Whether it supplies the customer’s indorsement is immaterial. Paragraph (2) satisfies the need for a receipt of funds by the depositary bank by imposing on that bank a warranty that it paid the customer or deposited the item to the customer’s account. This warranty runs not only to collecting banks and to the payor bank or nonbank drawee but also to the drawer, affording protection to these parties that the depositary bank received the item and applied it to the benefit of the holder.</annotation>
