    <text type="Uniform Commercial Code Comment"><strong>Purposes:</strong> This section uses the test of good faith, as defined in  Section 1-201 [7-102], to continue the policy of former  Section 7-404. Good faith now means “honesty in fact and the observance of reasonable commercial standards of fair dealing.” The section states explicitly that the common law rule of “innocent conversion” by unauthorized “intermeddling” with another’s property is inapplicable to the operations of commercial carriers and warehousemen that in good faith perform obligations that they have assumed and that generally they are under a legal compulsion to assume. The section applies to delivery to a fraudulent holder of a valid document as well as to delivery to the holder of an invalid document. Of course, in appropriate circumstances, a bailee may use interpleader or other dispute resolution process. See  Section 7-603.</text>
    <text type="Uniform Commercial Code Comment"><strong>Changes:</strong> Changes reflect the definition of good faith in  Section 1-201 [7-102] and for style.</text>

    <text type="Uniform Commercial Code Comment"><strong>Purposes of Changes:</strong> The generalized test of good faith and observance of reasonable commercial standards is substituted for the attempts to particularize what constitutes good faith in the cited sections of the old uniform acts. The section states explicitly what is perhaps an implication from the old acts that the common law rule of “innocent conversion” by unauthorized “intermeddling” with another’s property is inapplicable to the operations of commercial carriers and warehousemen, who in good faith and with reasonable observance of commercial standards perform obligations which they have assumed and which generally they are under a legal compulsion to assume. The section applies to delivery to a fraudulent holder of a valid document as well as to delivery to the holder of an invalid document.</text>
