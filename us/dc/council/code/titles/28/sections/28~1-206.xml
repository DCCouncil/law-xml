    <annotation type="Editor's Notes">The 2013 revision of this article deleted former <cite path="§28:1-206">§ 28:1-206</cite>. Former <cite path="§28:1-206">§ 28:1-206</cite> concerned a statute of frauds for kinds of personal property not otherwise covered, was derived from Dec. 30, 1963, 77 Stat. 636, Pub. L. 88-243, § 1; Apr. 9, 1997, <cite doc="D.C. Law 11-240">D.C. Law 11-240</cite>, § 3(c),  44 DCR 1087. The other articles of the Uniform Commercial Code make individual determinations as to requirements for memorializing transactions within their scope, so that the primary effect of former  Section 1-206 was to impose a writing requirement on sales transactions not otherwise governed by the UCC. Per the official commentary appearing under <cite path="§28:1-206">§ 28:1-206</cite>: “Deletion of former  Section 1-206 did not constitute a recommendation as to whether such sales transactions should be covered by a Statute of Frauds; rather, it reflected determination that there was no need for uniform commercial law to resolve that issue.”</annotation>

    <text type="Uniform Commercial Code Comment">1. Several sections of the Uniform Commercial Code state that there is a “presumption” as to a certain fact, or that the fact is “presumed.” This section, derived from the definition appearing in former  Section 1-201(31), indicates the effect of those provisions on the proof process.</text>
