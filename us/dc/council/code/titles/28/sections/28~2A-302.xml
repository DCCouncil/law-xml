    <text type="Uniform Commercial Code Comment"><strong>Purposes:</strong> The separation of ownership and possession of goods between the lessor and the lessee (or a third party) has created problems under certain fraudulent conveyance statutes. See, e.g.,  In re Ludlum Enters., 510 F.2d 996 (5th Cir.1975);  Suburbia Fed. Sav. &amp; Loan Ass’n v. Bel-Air Conditioning Co., 385 So.2d 1151 (Fla.Dist.Ct.App.1980). This section provides, among other things, that separation of ownership and possession per se does not affect the enforceability of the lease contract. Sections 2A-301 and 2A-308.</text>
    <text type="Uniform Commercial Code Comment"><strong>Changes:</strong>Section 9-202 was modified to reflect leasing terminology and to clarify the law of leases with respect to fraudulent conveyances or transfers.</text>
