  <para>
    <num>(c)</num>
    <text>A system satisfies subsection (b) of this section, and a person is deemed to have control of a transferable record, if the transferable record is created, stored, and assigned in such a manner that:</text>

    </para>
    <para>
      <num>(2)</num>
      <text>The authoritative copy identifies the person asserting control as:</text>

  <para>
    <num>(d)</num>
    <text>Except as otherwise agreed, a person having control of a transferable record is the holder, as defined in <cite path="§28:1-201|(20)" proof="true">§ 28:1-201(20)</cite>, of the transferable record and has the same rights and defenses as a holder of an equivalent record or writing under <cite path="28|I" proof="true">Subtitle I of this title</cite>, including, if the applicable statutory requirements under <cite path="§28:3-302|(a)">§ 28:3-302(a)</cite>, <cite path="§28:7-501">§ 28:7-501</cite>, or <cite path="§28:9-308">§ 28:9-308</cite> are satisfied, the rights and defenses of a holder in due course, a holder to which a negotiable document of title has been duly negotiated, or a purchaser, respectively.
