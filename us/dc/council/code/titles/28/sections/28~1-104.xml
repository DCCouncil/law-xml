    <text type="Uniform Commercial Code Comment">1. This section embodies the policy that an act that bears evidence of carefully considered permanent regulative intention should not lightly be regarded as impliedly repealed by subsequent legislation. The Uniform Commercial Code, carefully integrated and intended as a uniform codification of permanent character covering an entire “field” of law, is to be regarded as particularly resistant to implied repeal.</text>
    <text type="Uniform Commercial Code Comment"><strong>Changes from former law:</strong> Except for changing the form of reference to the Uniform Commercial Code, this section is identical to former  Section 1-104.</text>
