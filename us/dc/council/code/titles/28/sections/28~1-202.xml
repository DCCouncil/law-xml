    <text>Notice, knowledge, or a notice or notification received by an organization is effective for a particular transaction from the time it is brought to the attention of the individual conducting that transaction and, in any event, from the time it would have been brought to the individual’s attention if the organization had exercised due diligence. An organization exercises due diligence if it maintains reasonable routines for communicating significant information to the person conducting the transaction and there is reasonable compliance with the routines. Due diligence does not require an individual acting for the organization to communicate information unless the communication is part of the individual’s regular duties or the individual has reason to know of the transaction and that the transaction would be materially affected by the information.</text>

    <text type="Uniform Commercial Code Comment">3. Subsection (f) makes clear that notice, knowledge, or a notification, although “received,” for instance, by a clerk in Department A of an organization, is effective for a transaction conducted in Department B only from the time when it was or should have been communicated to the individual conducting that transaction.</text>
    <text type="Uniform Commercial Code Comment">2. As provided in subsection (d), the word “notifies” is used when the essential fact is the proper dispatch of the notice, not its receipt. Compare “Send.” When the essential fact is the other party’s receipt of the notice, that is stated. Subsection (e) states when a notification is received.</text>
    <text type="Uniform Commercial Code Comment">1. Under subsection (a), a person has notice of a fact when, inter alia, the person has received a notification of the fact in question.</text>
    <text type="Uniform Commercial Code Comment"><strong>Changes from former law:</strong> These provisions are substantive rather than purely definitional. Accordingly, they have been relocated from  Section 1-201 to this section. The reference to the “forgotten notice” doctrine has been deleted.</text>
