    <text type="Uniform Commercial Code Comment">4. The rules of this section operate in favor of whichever party to the lease contract may enforce it, even if one party perhaps may not, e.g., under Section 2A-201(1)(b).</text>
    <text type="Uniform Commercial Code Comment">3. To take priority over the lease contract, and the interests derived therefrom, the creditor must come within the exception stated in subsection (2) or within one of the provisions of Article 9 mentioned in subsection (3). Subsection (2) provides that where the creditor holds a lien (Section 2A-103(1)(r)) that attached before the lease contract became enforceable (Section 2A-301), the creditor does not take subject to the lease. Subsection (3) provides that a lessee takes its leasehold interest subject to a security interest except as otherwise provided in  Sections 9-317,  9-321, or  9-323.</text>
    <text type="Uniform Commercial Code Comment">2. Subsection (2) states a general rule of priority that a creditor of a lessor takes subject to the lease contract. Note the discussion above with regard to the scope of these rules. Section 2A-301 official comment 3(g). Thus, the section will not only cover disputes between the prime lessee and a creditor of the prime lessor but also disputes between the prime lessee, or the sublessee, and a creditor of the sublessor.</text>
    <text type="Uniform Commercial Code Comment"><strong>Purposes:</strong> 1. Subsection (1) states a general rule of priority that a creditor of the lessee takes subject to the lease contract. The term lessee (Section 2A-103(1)(n) includes sublessee. Therefore, this subsection not only covers disputes between the prime lessor and a creditor of the prime lessee but also disputes between the prime lessor, or the sublessor, and a creditor of the sublessee. Section 2A-301 official comment 3(g). Further, by using the term creditor ( Section 1-201(12)), this subsection will cover disputes with a general creditor, a secured creditor, a lien creditor and any representative of creditors. Section 2A-103(4).</text>
    <text type="Uniform Commercial Code Comment"><strong>Changes:</strong> The provisions of  Sections 9-301 and  9-307(1) and (3) were incorporated, and modified to reflect leasing terminology and the basic concepts reflected in this Article.</text>
    <text type="Uniform Commercial Code Comment"><strong>Uniform Statutory Source:</strong> None for subsection (1). Subsection (2) is derived from  Section 9-301, and subsections (3) and (4) are derived from  Section 9-307(1) and (3), respectively.</text>
