    <text type="Uniform Commercial Code Comment">3. Preservation of Set-Off Right. Subsection (b) makes clear that a bank may hold both a right of set-off against, and an Article 9 security interest in, the same deposit account. By holding a security interest in a deposit account, a bank does not impair any right of set-off it would otherwise enjoy. This subsection does not pertain to accounts evidenced by an instrument (e.g., certain certificates of deposit), which are excluded from the definition of “deposit accounts.”</text>
    <text type="Uniform Commercial Code Comment">This section deals with rights of set-off and recoupment that a bank may have under other law. It does not create a right of set-off or recoupment, nor is it intended to override any limitations or restrictions that other law imposes on the exercise of those rights.</text>
    <text type="Uniform Commercial Code Comment">Subsection (a) states the general rule and provides that the bank may effectively exercise rights of recoupment and set-off against the secured party. Subsection (c) contains an exception: if the secured party has control under  Section 9-104(a)(3) (i.e., if it has become the bank’s customer), then any set-off exercised by the bank against a debt owed by the debtor (as opposed to a debt owed to the bank by the secured party) is ineffective. The bank may, however, exercise its recoupment rights effectively. This result is consistent with the priority rule in  Section 9-327(4), under which the security interest of a bank in a deposit account is subordinate to that of a secured party who has control under  Section 9-104(a)(3).</text>
    <text type="Uniform Commercial Code Comment">2. Set-off vs. Security Interest. This section resolves the conflict between a security interest in a deposit account and the bank’s rights of recoupment and set-off.</text>
    <text type="Uniform Commercial Code Comment">1. Source. New; subsection (b) is based on a nonuniform Illinois amendment.</text>
