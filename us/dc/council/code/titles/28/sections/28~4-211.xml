  <heading>When bank gives value for purposes of holder in due course.</heading>
  <text>For purposes of determining its status as a holder in due course, a bank has given value to the extent it has a security interest in an item, if the bank otherwise complies with the requirements of section 28:3-302   on what constitutes a holder in due course.</text>

    <text type="Uniform Commercial Code Comment">The section completes the thought of the previous section and makes clear that a security interest in an item is “value” for the purpose of determining the holder’s status as a holder in due course. The provision is in accord with the prior law (N.I.L. Section 27) and with Article 3 ( Section 3-303). The section does not prescribe a security interest under  Section 4-210 as a test of “value” generally because the meaning of “value” under other Articles is adequately defined in  Section 1-201.</text>
