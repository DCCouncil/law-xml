    <text type="Uniform Commercial Code Comment">7. Investment Property. Subsections (f) and (g) follow former  Section 9-115(2).</text>
    <text type="Uniform Commercial Code Comment">Similarly, this Article does not determine who has the power to release a mortgage of record. That issue is determined by real-property law.</text>
    <text type="Uniform Commercial Code Comment">Under this Article, attachment and perfection of a security interest in a secured right to payment do not of themselves affect the obligation to pay. For example, if the obligation is evidenced by a negotiable note, then Article 3 dictates the person whom the maker must pay to discharge the note and any lien securing it. See  Section 3-602. If the right to payment is a payment intangible, then  Section 9-406 determines whom the account debtor must pay.</text>
    <text type="Uniform Commercial Code Comment">An important consequence of the rules in  Section 9-203(g) and subsection (e) is that, by acquiring a perfected security interest in a mortgage (or other secured) note, the secured party acquires a security interest in the mortgage (or other lien) that is senior to the rights of a person who becomes a lien creditor of the mortgagee (Article 9 debtor). See  Section 9-317(a)(2). This result helps prevent the separation of the mortgage (or other lien) from the note.</text>
    <text type="Uniform Commercial Code Comment">Example 3: Owner gives to Mortgagee a mortgage on Blackacre to secure a loan. Owner’s obligation to pay is evidenced by a promissory note. In need of working capital, Mortgagee borrows from Financer and creates a security interest in the note in favor of Financer.  Section 9-203(g) adopts the traditional view that the mortgage follows the note; i.e., the transferee of the note acquires the mortgage, as well. This subsection adopts a similar principle: perfection of a security interest in the right to payment constitutes perfection of a security interest in the mortgage securing it.</text>
    <text type="Uniform Commercial Code Comment">6. Rights to Payment Secured by Lien. Subsection (e) is new. It deals with the situation in which a security interest is created in a right to payment that is secured by a security interest, mortgage, or other lien.</text>
    <text type="Uniform Commercial Code Comment">Example 2: Buyer is obligated to pay Debtor for goods sold. Buyer’s president guarantees the obligation. Debtor creates a security interest in the right to payment (account) in favor of Lender. Under  Section 9-203(f), the security interest attaches to Debtor’s rights under the guarantee (supporting obligation). Under subsection (d), perfection of the security interest in the account constitutes perfection of the security interest in Debtor’s rights under the guarantee.</text>
    <text type="Uniform Commercial Code Comment">5. Supporting Obligations. Subsection (d) is new. It provides for automatic perfection of a security interest in a supporting obligation for collateral if the security interest in the collateral is perfected. This is unlikely to effect any change in the law prior to adoption of this Article.</text>
    <text type="Uniform Commercial Code Comment">If the successive stages of Bank’s security interest succeed each other without an intervening gap, the security interest is “perfected continuously,” and the date of perfection is when the security interest first became perfected (i.e., when Bank received possession of the bill of lading). If, however, there is a gap between stages-for example, if Bank does not file until after the expiration of the 20-day period specified in  Section 9-312(f) and leaves the collateral in the debtor’s possession-then, the chain being broken, the perfection is no longer continuous. The date of perfection would now be the date of filing (after expiration of the 20-day period). Bank’s security interest would be vulnerable to any interests arising during the gap period which under  Section 9-317 take priority over an unperfected security interest.</text>
    <text type="Uniform Commercial Code Comment">Example 1: Debtor, an importer, creates a security interest in goods that it imports and the documents of title that cover the goods. The secured party, Bank, takes possession of a negotiable bill of lading covering certain imported goods and thereby perfects its security interest in the bill of lading and the goods. See  Sections 9-313(a),  9-312(c)(1). Bank releases the bill of lading to the debtor for the purpose of procuring the goods from the carrier and selling them. Under  Section 9-312(f), Bank continues to have a perfected security interest in the document and goods for 20 days. Bank files a financing statement covering the collateral before the expiration of the 20-day period. Its security interest now continues perfected for as long as the filing is good.</text>
    <text type="Uniform Commercial Code Comment">4. Continuous Perfection. The following example illustrates the operation of subsection (c):</text>
    <text type="Uniform Commercial Code Comment">3. Agricultural Liens. Subsection (b) is new. It describes the elements of perfection of an agricultural lien.</text>
    <text type="Uniform Commercial Code Comment">Subsection (a) explains that the time of perfection is when the security interest has attached and any necessary steps for perfection, such as taking possession or filing, have been taken. The “except” clause refers to the perfection-upon-attachment rules appearing in  Section 9-309. It also reflects that other subsections of this section, e.g., subsection (d), contain automatic-perfection rules. If the steps for perfection have been taken in advance, as when the secured party files a financing statement before giving value or before the debtor acquires rights in the collateral, then the security interest is perfected when it attaches.</text>
    <text type="Uniform Commercial Code Comment">2. General Rule. This Article uses the term “attach” to describe the point at which property becomes subject to a security interest. The requisites for attachment are stated in  Section 9-203. When it attaches, a security interest may be either perfected or unperfected. “Perfected” means that the security interest has attached and the secured party has taken all the steps required by this Article as specified in  Sections 9-310 through  9-316. A perfected security interest may still be or become subordinate to other interests. See, e.g.,  Sections 9-320,  9-322. However, in general, after perfection the secured party is protected against creditors and transferees of the debtor and, in particular, against any representative of creditors in insolvency proceedings instituted by or against the debtor. See, e.g.,  Section 9-317.</text>
