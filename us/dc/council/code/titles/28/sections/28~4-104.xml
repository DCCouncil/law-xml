    <text type="Uniform Commercial Code Comment">The other modifications are made to conform with current legislative drafting practices, with no intent to change substance.</text>
    <text type="Uniform Commercial Code Comment">The terms “remitting bank,” “protest,” and “second party” are deleted because they are not used in Article 4.</text>
    <text type="Uniform Commercial Code Comment">The definition of “settle” is amended in changing “instructed” to “agreed” to conform to  Section 4-213.</text>
    <text type="Uniform Commercial Code Comment">The latter provision makes clear that a bank that fails to pay an overdraft has not wrongfully dishonored unless it had agreed to pay the overdraft.</text>
    <text type="Uniform Commercial Code Comment">The definition of “properly payable” is deleted. In former Article 4 there is no affirmative definition of the term “properly payable.“ Former  Section 4-104(1)(i) merely implies that if the customer’s account is insufficient to pay the item the item is not properly payable. The phrase is defined in proposed  Section 4-401(1) in terms of the items authorized by the customer and in accordance with the bank-customer agreement. This is done to give meaning to “properly payable” in  Sections 4-401(1) and  4-402(1).</text>
    <text type="Uniform Commercial Code Comment">The definition of “item” is amended because the term “instrument” as defined in  Section 3-104 and as used in Article 4 is narrower than the term “item.” See the Official Comment.</text>
    <text type="Uniform Commercial Code Comment">The definition of “drawee” is new and is explained in the Official Comment.</text>
    <text type="Uniform Commercial Code Comment">The definition of “draft” is new and is explained in the Official Comment.</text>
    <text type="Uniform Commercial Code Comment">The definition of “documentary draft” is amended to recognize the existence of uncertificated securities. The reference to “accompanying documents” is deleted as obsolete. It is enough that the documents are to be received by the drawee or other payor before acceptance or payment of the draft.</text>
    <text type="Uniform Commercial Code Comment">The definition of “account” is amended to make clear that it includes both asset accounts in which a customer has deposited money and accounts from which a customer may draw on a line of credit. The remainder of the definition is amended to bring it more into conformity with the definition of “deposit account” in  Section 9-105(1)(e).</text>
    <text type="Uniform Commercial Code Comment">Reason for 1990 Change [<cite doc="D.C. Law 10-249">D.C. Law 10-249</cite>]</text>
    <text type="Uniform Commercial Code Comment">11. Paragraph (a)(12): “Suspends payments.” This term is designed to afford an objective test to determine when a bank is no longer operating as a part of the banking system.</text>
    <text type="Uniform Commercial Code Comment">Examples of the various types of settlement contemplated by the term include payments in cash; the efficient but somewhat complicated process of payment through the adjustment and offsetting of balances through clearing houses; debit or credit entries in accounts between banks; the forwarding of various types of remittance instruments, sometimes to cover a particular item but more frequently to cover an entire group of items received on a particular day.</text>
    <text type="Uniform Commercial Code Comment">The term “settle” is used as a convenient term to characterize a broad variety of conditional, provisional, tentative and also final payments of items. Such a comprehensive term is needed because it is frequently difficult or unnecessary to determine whether a particular action is tentative or final or when a particular credit shifts from the tentative class to the final class. Therefore, its use throughout the Article indicates that in that particular context it is unnecessary or unwise to determine whether the debit or the credit or the payment is tentative or final. However, if qualified by the adjective “provisional” its tentative nature is intended, and if qualified by the adjective “final” its permanent nature is intended.</text>
    <text type="Uniform Commercial Code Comment">Similarly, some cases fail to recognize that within a single bank, particularly a payor bank, each item goes through a series of processes and that in a payor bank most of these processes are preliminary to the basic act of payment or “final payment.”</text>
    <text type="Uniform Commercial Code Comment">10. Paragraph (a)(11): The term “settle” has substantial importance throughout Article 4. In the American Bankers Association Bank Collection Code, in deferred posting statutes, in Federal Reserve regulations and operating circulars, in clearing-house rules, in agreements between banks and customers and in legends on deposit tickets and collection letters, there is repeated reference to “conditional” or “provisional” credits or payments. Tied in with this concept of credits or payments being in some way tentative, has been a related but somewhat different problem as to when an item is “paid” or “finally paid” either to determine the relative priority of the item as against attachments, stop-payment orders and the like or in insolvency situations. There has been extensive litigation in the various states on these problems. To a substantial extent the confusion, the litigation and even the resulting court decisions fail to take into account that in the collection process some debits or credits are provisional or tentative and others are final and that very many debits or credits are provisional or tentative for awhile but later become final.</text>
    <text type="Uniform Commercial Code Comment">9. Paragraph (a)(10): “Midnight deadline.” The use of this phrase is an example of the more mechanical approach used in this Article. Midnight is selected as a termination point or time limit to obtain greater uniformity and definiteness than would be possible from other possible terminating points, such as the close of the banking day or business day.</text>
    <text type="Uniform Commercial Code Comment">8. Paragraph (a)(9): “Item” is defined broadly to include an instrument, as defined in  Section 3-104, as well as promises or orders that may not be within the definition of “instrument.” The terms “promise” and “order” are defined in  Section 3-103. A promise is a written undertaking to pay money. An order is a written instruction to pay money. But see  Section 4-110(c). Since bonds and other investment securities under Article 8 may be within the term “instrument” or “promise,” they are items and when handled by banks for collection are subject to this Article. See Comment 1 to  Section 4-102. The functional limitation on the meaning of this term is the willingness of the banking system to handle the instrument, undertaking or instruction for collection or payment.</text>
    <text type="Uniform Commercial Code Comment">7. Paragraph (a)(8): “Drawee” is defined in  Section 3-103 in terms of an Article 3 draft which is a form of instrument. Here “drawee” is defined in terms of an Article 4 draft which includes items that may not be instruments.</text>
    <text type="Uniform Commercial Code Comment">6. Paragraph (a)(7): “Draft” is defined in  Section 3-104 as a form of instrument. Since Article 4 applies to items that may not fall within the definition of instrument, the term is defined here to include an item that is a written order to pay money, even though the item may not qualify as an instrument. The term “order” is defined in  Section 3-103.</text>
    <text type="Uniform Commercial Code Comment">5. Paragraph (a)(6): “Documentary draft” applies even though the documents do not accompany the draft but are to be received by the drawee or other payor before acceptance or payment of the draft.</text>
    <text type="Uniform Commercial Code Comment">4. Paragraph (a)(5): “Customer.” It is to be noted that this term includes a bank carrying an account with another bank as well as the more typical nonbank customer or depositor.</text>
    <text type="Uniform Commercial Code Comment">3. Paragraph (a)(4): “Clearing house.” Occasionally express companies, governmental agencies and other nonbanks deal directly with a clearing house; hence the definition does not limit the term to an association of banks.</text>
    <text type="Uniform Commercial Code Comment">2. Paragraph (a)(3): “Banking day.” Under this definition that part of a business day when a bank is open only for limited functions, e.g., to receive deposits and cash checks, but with loan, bookkeeping and other departments closed, is not part of a banking day.</text>
    <text type="Uniform Commercial Code Comment">1. Paragraph (a)(1): “Account” is defined to include both asset accounts in which a customer has deposited money and accounts from which a customer may draw on a line of credit. The limiting factor is that the account must be in a bank.</text>
