    <text type="Uniform Commercial Code Comment">4. Subsection (b) continues the law which gave full effect to the issuance or due negotiation of a negotiable document. The subsection adds nothing to the effect of the rules stated in subsection (a), but it has been included since such explicit reference was provided under former  Section 7-502 to preserve the right of a purchaser by due negotiation. The listing is not exhaustive. The language “any stoppage” is included lest an inference be drawn that a stoppage of the goods before or after transit might cut off or otherwise impair the purchaser’s rights.</text>
    <text type="Uniform Commercial Code Comment">3. The explicit statement in subsection (a)(4) of the bailee’s direct obligation to the holder precludes the defense that the document in question was “spent” after the carrier had delivered the goods to a previous holder. But the holder is subject to such defenses as non-negligent destruction even though not apparent on the document. The sentence on delivery orders applies only to delivery orders in negotiable form which have been duly negotiated. On delivery orders, see also  Section 7-503(b) and Comment.</text>
    <text type="Uniform Commercial Code Comment">2. Subsection (a)(3) covers the case of “feeding” of a duly negotiated document by subsequent delivery to the bailee of such goods as the document falsely purported to cover; the bailee in such case is estopped as against the holder of the document.</text>
    <text type="Uniform Commercial Code Comment"><strong>Purpose:</strong> 1. This section applies to both tangible and electronic documents of title. The elements of duly negotiated, which constitutes a due negotiation, are set forth in  Section 7-501. The several necessary qualifications of the broad principle that the holder of a document acquired in a due negotiation is the owner of the document and the goods have been brought together in the next section ( Section 7-503).</text>

    <text type="Uniform Commercial Code Comment">4. Subsection (2) condenses and continues the law of a number of sections of the prior acts which gave full effect to the issuance or due negotiation of a negotiable document. The subsection adds nothing to the effect of the rules stated in subsection (1), but it has been included since such explicit references were relied upon under the prior acts to preserve the rights of a purchaser by due negotiation unimpaired. The listing is not exhaustive. Only those matters have been repeated in this subsection which were explicitly reserved in the prior acts except in the case of stoppage in transit. Here, the language has been broadened to include “any stoppage” lest an inference be drawn that a stoppage of the goods before or after transit might cut off or otherwise impair the purchaser’s rights.</text>
    <text type="Uniform Commercial Code Comment">3. The explicit statement in subsection (1)(d) of the bailee’s direct obligation to the holder precludes the defense, sometimes successfully asserted under the old acts, that the document in question was “spent” after the carrier had delivered the goods to a previous holder. But the holder is subject to such defenses as non-negligent destruction even though not apparent on the face of the document, and the bailee’s obligation is of course subject to lawful provisions in filed classifications and tariffs. See  Sections 7-103,  7-403. The sentence on delivery orders applies only to delivery orders in negotiable form which have been duly negotiated. On delivery orders, see also  Section 7-503(2) and Comment.</text>
    <text type="Uniform Commercial Code Comment">2. Subsection (1)(c) covers the case of “feeding” of a duly negotiated document by subsequent delivery to the bailee of such goods as the document falsely purported to cover; the bailee in such case is estopped as against the holder of the document.</text>
    <text type="Uniform Commercial Code Comment"><strong>Purposes of Changes:</strong> 1. The several necessary qualifications of the broad principle that the holder of a document acquired in a due negotiation is the owner of the document and the goods have been brought together in the next section.</text>
    <text type="Uniform Commercial Code Comment"><strong>Changes:</strong> Rewritten.</text>
