    <text type="Uniform Commercial Code Comment">2. Waiver. This section is a limited exception to  Section 9-602, which generally prohibits waiver by debtors and obligors. It makes no provision for waiver of the rule prohibiting a secured party from buying at its own private disposition. Transactions of this kind are equivalent to “strict foreclosures” and are governed by  Sections 9-620,  9-621, and  9-622.</text>
