    <text type="Uniform Commercial Code Comment"><strong>Purposes:</strong> The bailee’s liability on its document despite non-receipt or misdescription of the goods is affirmed in  Sections 7-203 and  7-301. The purpose of this section is to make it clear that regardless of irregularities a document which falls within the definition of document of title imposes on the issuer the obligations stated in this Article. For example, a bailee will not be permitted to avoid its obligation to deliver the goods ( Section 7-403) or its obligation of due care with respect to them ( Sections 7-204 and  7-309) by taking the position that no valid “document” was issued because it failed to file a statutory bond or did not pay stamp taxes or did not disclose the place of storage in the document.

Sanctions against violations of statutory or administrative duties with respect to documents should be limited to revocation of license or other measures prescribed by the regulation imposing the duty.
