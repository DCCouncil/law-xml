    <text>Except for negotiation by a remitter, if an instrument is payable to an identified person, negotiation requires transfer of possession of the instrument and its indorsement by the holder. If an instrument is payable to bearer, it may be negotiated by transfer of possession alone.</text>

    <text type="Uniform Commercial Code Comment">3. Other sections of Article 3 may modify the rule stated in the first sentence of subsection (b). See for example,  Sections 3-404,  3-405 and  3-406.</text>
    <text type="Uniform Commercial Code Comment">2. In most cases negotiation occurs by a transfer of possession by a holder or remitter. Remitter transactions usually involve a cashier’s or teller’s check. For example, Buyer buys goods from Seller and pays for them with a cashier’s check of Bank that Buyer buys from Bank. The check is issued by Bank when it is delivered to Buyer, regardless of whether the check is payable to Buyer or to Seller.  Section 3-105(a). If the check is payable to Buyer, negotiation to Seller is done by delivery of the check to Seller after it is indorsed by Buyer. It is more common, however, that the check when issued will be payable to Seller. In that case Buyer is referred to as the “remitter.”  Section 3-103(a)(11). The remitter, although not a party to the check, is the owner of the check until ownership is transferred to Seller by delivery. This transfer is a negotiation because Seller becomes the holder of the check when Seller obtains possession. In some cases Seller may have acted fraudulently in obtaining possession of the check. In those cases Buyer may be entitled to rescind the transfer to Seller because of the fraud and assert a claim of ownership to the check under  Section 3-306 against Seller or a subsequent transferee of the check.  Section 3-202(b) provides for rescission of negotiation, and that provision applies to rescission by a remitter as well as by a holder.</text>
    <text type="Uniform Commercial Code Comment">1. Subsections (a) and (b) are based in part on subsection (1) of former  Section 3-202. A person can become holder of an instrument when the instrument is issued to that person, or the status of holder can arise as the result of an event that occurs after issuance. “Negotiation” is the term used in Article 3 to describe this post-issuance event. Normally, negotiation occurs as the result of a voluntary transfer of possession of an instrument by a holder to another person who becomes the holder as a result of the transfer. Negotiation always requires a change in possession of the instrument because nobody can be a holder without possessing the instrument, either directly or through an agent. But in some cases the transfer of possession is involuntary and in some cases the person transferring possession is not a holder. In defining “negotiation” former  Section 3-202(1) used the word “transfer,” an undefined term, and “delivery,” defined in  Section 1-201(14) to mean voluntary change of possession. Instead, subsections (a) and (b) use the term “transfer of possession” and, subsection (a) states that negotiation can occur by an involuntary transfer of possession. For example, if an instrument is payable to bearer and it is stolen by Thief or is found by Finder, Thief or Finder becomes the holder of the instrument when possession is obtained. In this case there is an involuntary transfer of possession that results in negotiation to Thief or Finder.</text>
