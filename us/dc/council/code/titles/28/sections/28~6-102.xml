    <text type="Uniform Commercial Code Comment">Point 1(h):  Section 2-201 and Article 2 generally.</text>
    <text type="Uniform Commercial Code Comment">Point 1(g): Article 2 generally.</text>
    <text type="Uniform Commercial Code Comment">Point 1(c):  Sections 1-201 and  6-103.</text>
    <text type="Uniform Commercial Code Comment">Cross-References: Point 1(a):  Section 9-313.</text>
    <text type="Uniform Commercial Code Comment">Cross-References: 2. “Good faith”. This Article adopts the definition of “good faith” in Article 1 in all cases, even when the buyer is a merchant.</text>
    <text type="Uniform Commercial Code Comment">(p) “Verified”. New.</text>
    <text type="Uniform Commercial Code Comment">(o) “Value”. New. The definition in  Section 1-201(44) is not appropriate in the context of this Article.</text>
    <text type="Uniform Commercial Code Comment">(n) “United States”. New. This subsection derives from  Section 9-103(3)(c).</text>
    <text type="Uniform Commercial Code Comment">(m) “In the ordinary course of the seller’s business”. New.</text>
    <text type="Uniform Commercial Code Comment">(l) “Net proceeds”. New. The term appears, without definition, in  Section 6-108 (1987 Official Text).</text>
    <text type="Uniform Commercial Code Comment">(k) “Net contract price”. New. Consideration is not “new consideration” to the extent that it consists of the partial or total satisfaction of an antecedent debt owed to the buyer by the seller. When the buyer buys assets along with property other than assets, the “net contract price” is that portion of the new consideration allocable to the assets.</text>
    <text type="Uniform Commercial Code Comment">(j) “Liquidator”. New. Although the definition of “liquidator” is quite broad, the term is used with respect to sales that are “conducted” by a liquidator on behalf of the seller. See subsection (1)(c)(i). Thus only those liquidators that “conduct” sales will be affected by this Article.</text>
    <text type="Uniform Commercial Code Comment">(i) “Debt”. New. This subsection is borrowed from  Bankruptcy Code Section 101(11).</text>
    <text type="Uniform Commercial Code Comment">(h) “Date of the bulk-sale agreement”. New. Law outside this Article, including the provisions of Article 2, determines when an agreement for a bulk sale becomes enforceable between the buyer and the seller and when an auctioneer or liquidator is engaged.</text>
    <text type="Uniform Commercial Code Comment">The connection between the time of transfer and the buyer’s rights under the bulk-sale agreement appears only for purposes of sales to which this Article applies. Subsection (1)(g) does not purport to affect the rights of creditors of a seller of property for other purposes or under other circumstances.</text>
    <text type="Uniform Commercial Code Comment">(g) “Date of the bulk sale”. New. The parties are able to control the date of the bulk sale in several ways. They can keep the proceeds of the sale in escrow, thereby delaying the date of payment, or they can specifically agree that the assets remain subject to the reach of the seller’s creditors, thereby delaying the date that the assets are transferred. By adjusting the time that the buyer acquires an unconditional right to possess tangible assets and the time the buyer acquires an unconditional right to use intangible assets, the parties may affect the substantive rights of creditors and thereby control the date the assets are transferred.</text>
    <text type="Uniform Commercial Code Comment">(f) “Creditor”. New. The term includes all holders of claims against the seller, even holders of claims arising from consumer transactions. Compare “Claimant” (subsection (1)(e)).</text>
    <text type="Uniform Commercial Code Comment">States that choose not to afford taxing authorities the benefits of this Article should adopt Alternative A. Adoption of Alternative B would afford the benefits of this Article to taxing authorities except with respect to those taxes as to which there has been compliance with another statute requiring that notice of the bulk sale be given to the taxing authority.</text>
    <text type="Uniform Commercial Code Comment">(e) “Claimant”. New. This term defines the category of claim holders who are the primary beneficiaries of the duties that this Article imposes. Compare “Creditor” (subsection (1)(f)).</text>
    <text type="Uniform Commercial Code Comment">(d) “Claim”. New. The first sentence derives from Bankruptcy Code s 101(4),  11 U.S.C. § 101(4). Changes, including the deletion of Section 101(4)(B), were made for stylistic purposes only.</text>
    <text type="Uniform Commercial Code Comment">The seller must “continue to operate” the same or a similar kind of business as owner. If the owner sells the business assets to a buyer and continues to manage the business as an employee of the buyer, the seller is not continuing to operate the business within the meaning of this Article.</text>
    <text type="Uniform Commercial Code Comment">Not every change in business operations poses a substantial enough risk to creditors to justify the costs of compliance with this Article. Thus, in determining whether post-sale business is of a kind that is “the same” or “similar” to the business conducted before the sale, a court should consider whether, viewed from the perspective of the creditors of the seller, the change poses extraordinary risks or whether the change is a normal risk that creditors can be assumed to take. In particular, when the post-bulk sale business differs from the pre-bulk sale business only in the size of the business conducted, the seller should be considered to be continuing in the same or a similar kind of business and the sale should not be considered a bulk sale.</text>
    <text type="Uniform Commercial Code Comment">Whether an inquiry is “reasonable” depends on the facts and circumstances of each case. These facts and circumstances may include the identities of the buyer and seller and the type of assets being sold. In some cases, a reasonable inquiry may consist of no inquiry at all concerning the seller’s future.</text>
    <text type="Uniform Commercial Code Comment">In an effort to limit its coverage to sales posing the greatest risks to creditors, this Article adds an additional element to the definition of “bulk sale.” A sale is not a “bulk sale” unless the buyer, auctioneer, or liquidator has notice, or after a reasonable inquiry would have had notice, that the seller will not continue to operate the same or a similar kind of business after the sale. Whether a person has “notice” depends upon what the person knows and what the person would have known had the person conducted a reasonable inquiry. The issue of whether a transaction was a bulk sale is likely to be litigated only when the seller has absconded with the sale proceeds. This Article requires that the matters as to which the buyer, auctioneer, or liquidator had notice be determined only by reference to facts that the person knew or would have known at the date of the bulk-sale agreement. Reference to what actually occurred is inappropriate.</text>
    <text type="Uniform Commercial Code Comment">The determination whether a sale is a “bulk sale” and thus subject to this Article is not affected by whether other types of property are sold in connection with inventory. However, other provisions of this Article take account of the fact that other property may be sold in connection with inventory. For example, the availability of the exclusion in  Section 6-103(3)(l) turns on the value of all the “assets,” not just the inventory. Similarly, the notice required by  Section 6-105 must describe the “assets,” not just the inventory. And  Section 6-107(4) measures the buyer’s maximum cumulative liability for noncompliance by the value of the inventory and equipment sold in the bulk sale.</text>
    <text type="Uniform Commercial Code Comment">The elements of both direct and indirect sales are the same. Some of these elements have been borrowed from the 1987 Official Text of Article 6 and restated. For example, the term includes only sales that are not “in the ordinary course of the seller’s business“ (subsection (1)(m)). The sale must be of ”more than half of the seller’s inventory, as measured by value [subsection (1)(o)] on the date of the bulk-sale agreement [subsection (1)(h)].“ All inventory owned by the seller should be included in the calculation, regardless of where it is located. Inventory that is encumbered by a security interest or lien should be counted at its gross value, although the fact that it is encumbered may affect the applicability of this Article to the sale.</text>
    <text type="Uniform Commercial Code Comment">(c) “Bulk Sale”. Bulk sales are of two kinds. Subsection (1)(c)(i) describes bulk sales conducted by a professional intermediary (i.e., an auctioneer or liquidator), as to which sales  Section 6-108 applies. If these indirect sales occur as a series of related sales, then the entire series is treated as a single “bulk sale” and the term applies to the sales in the aggregate. Sales made directly by the seller to the buyer, described in subsection (1)(c)(ii), include sales conducted by an auctioneer or liquidator for its own account.</text>
    <text type="Uniform Commercial Code Comment">(b) “Auctioneer”. Compare  Section 6-108(3) (1987 Official Text).</text>
    <text type="Uniform Commercial Code Comment">1. (a) “Assets”. New. The term generally includes only “personal property.” Whether particular property is “personal property“ is to be determined by law outside this Article; however, for purposes of this Article, (i) the term includes ‘’readily removable factory and office machines“ (compare  Section 9-313(4)(c)), even if they are covered by applicable real estate law and thus are “fixtures” as defined in  Section 9-313(1)(a); (ii) the term does not include the lessee’s interest in a lease of real property, even if that interest is considered to be personal property under other applicable law; and (iii) the term does not include property to the extent that it is “generally exempt from creditor process under nonbankruptcy law.”</text>
