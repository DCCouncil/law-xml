  <heading>Secured party not obligated on contract of debtor or in tort.</heading>

    <text type="Uniform Commercial Code Comment">2. Nonliability of Secured Party. This section, like former  Section 9-317, rejects theories on which a secured party might be held liable on a debtor’s contracts or in tort merely because a security interest exists or because the debtor is entitled to dispose of or use collateral. This section expands former  Section 9-317 to cover agricultural liens.</text>
