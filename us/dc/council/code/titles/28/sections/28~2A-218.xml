    <text type="Uniform Commercial Code Comment"><strong>Purposes:</strong> Subsection (2) states a rule allowing substitution of goods by the lessor under certain circumstances, until default or insolvency of the lessor, or until notification to the lessee that identification is final. Subsection (3) states a rule regarding the lessor’s insurable interest that, by virtue of the difference between a sale and a lease, necessarily is different from the rule stated in  Section 2-501(2) regarding the seller’s insurable interest. For this purpose the option to buy shall be deemed to have been exercised by the lessee when the resulting sale is closed, not when the lessee gives notice to the lessor. Further, subsection (5) is new and reflects the common practice of shifting the responsibility and cost of insuring the goods between the parties to the lease transaction.</text>
    <text type="Uniform Commercial Code Comment"><strong>Changes:</strong> This section, together with Section 2A-217, is derived from the provisions of  Section 2-501, with changes and additions to reflect leasing practices and terminology.</text>
