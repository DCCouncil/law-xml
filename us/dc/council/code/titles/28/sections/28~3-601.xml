    <annotation type="Uniform Commercial Code Comment">Subsection (a) replaces subsections (1) and (2) of former  Section 3-601. Subsection (b) restates former  Section 3-602. Notice of discharge is not treated as notice of a defense that prevents holder in due course status.  Section 3-302(b). Discharge is effective against a holder in due course only if the holder had notice of the discharge when holder in due course status was acquired. For example, if an instrument bearing a canceled indorsement is taken by a holder, the holder has notice that the indorser has been discharged. Thus, the discharge is effective against the holder even if the holder is a holder in due course.</annotation>
