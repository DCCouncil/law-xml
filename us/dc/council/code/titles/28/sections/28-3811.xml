      <para>
        <num>(B)</num>
        <text>read as follows:</text>
        <text>“If this agreement was solicited at or near your residence and you do not want the goods or services, you may cancel this agreement by mailing a notice to the seller.

    <para>
      <num>(2)</num>
      <text>If the down payment includes goods traded in, the goods must be tendered in substantially as good condition as when received by the seller.

      <text>Except as provided by the provisions on retention of goods by the buyer (subsection (h)(4) of this section), within a reasonable time after a home solicitation sale has been canceled or an offer to purchase revoked, the buyer upon demand must tender to the seller any goods delivered by the seller pursuant to the sale but he is not obligated to tender at any place other than his residence. If the seller fails to demand possession of goods within a reasonable time after cancellation or revocation, the goods become the property of the buyer without obligation to pay for them.
