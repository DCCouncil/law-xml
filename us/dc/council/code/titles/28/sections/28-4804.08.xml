  <text>If a trustee determines that an allocation between principal and income required by <cite path="§28-4804.09">§ 28-4804.09</cite>, <cite path="§28-4804.10">§ 28-4804.10</cite>, <cite path="§28-4804.11">§ 28-4804.11</cite>, <cite path="§28-4804.12">§ 28-4804.12</cite>, or <cite path="§28-4804.15">§ 28-4804.15</cite> is insubstantial, the trustee may allocate the entire amount to principal unless one of the circumstances described in <cite path="§28-4801.04|(c)">§ 28-4801.04(c)</cite> applies to the allocation. This power may be exercised by a cotrustee in the circumstances described in <cite path="§28-4801.04|(d)">§ 28-4801.04(d)</cite> and may be released for the reasons and in the manner described in <cite path="§28-4801.04|(e)">§ 28-4801.04(e)</cite>. An allocation is presumed to be insubstantial if:</text>
