    <text type="Uniform Commercial Code Comment">3. Relationship to  Section 9-507. This section applies to financing statements that contain information that is incorrect at the time of filing and imposes a small risk of subordination on the filer. In contrast,  Section 9-507 deals with financing statements containing information that is correct at the time of filing but which becomes incorrect later. Except as provided in  Section 9-507 with respect to changes in the debtor’s name, an otherwise effective financing statement does not become ineffective if the information contained in it becomes inaccurate.</text>
    <text type="Uniform Commercial Code Comment">2. Effect of Incorrect Information in Financing Statement.  Section 9-520(a) requires the filing office to reject financing statements that do not contain information concerning the debtor as specified in  Section 9-516(b)(5). An error in this information does not render the financing statement ineffective. On rare occasions, a subsequent purchaser of the collateral (i.e., a buyer or secured party) may rely on the misinformation to its detriment. This section subordinates a security interest or agricultural lien perfected by an effective, but flawed, financing statement to the rights of a buyer or holder of a perfected security interest to the extent that, in reasonable reliance on the incorrect information, the purchaser gives value and, in the case of tangible collateral, receives delivery of the collateral. A purchaser who has not made itself aware of the information in the filing office with respect to the debtor cannot act in “reasonable reliance” upon incorrect information.</text>
