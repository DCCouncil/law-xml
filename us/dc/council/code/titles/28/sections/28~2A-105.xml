    <text type="Uniform Commercial Code Comment"><strong>Purposes:</strong> The new certificate referred to in (b) must be permanent, not temporary. Generally, the lessor or creditor whose interest is indicated on the most recently issued certificate of title will prevail over interests indicated on certificates issued previously by other jurisdictions. This provision reflects a policy that it is reasonable to require holders of interests in goods covered by a certificate of title to police the goods or risk losing their interests when a new certificate of title is issued by another jurisdiction.</text>
    <text type="Uniform Commercial Code Comment"><strong>Changes:</strong> Substantially revised. The provisions of the last sentence of  Section 9-103(2)(b) have not been incorporated as it is superfluous in this context. The provisions of  Section 9-103(2)(d) have not been incorporated because the problems dealt with are adequately addressed by this section and Sections 2A-304(3) and 305(3).</text>
