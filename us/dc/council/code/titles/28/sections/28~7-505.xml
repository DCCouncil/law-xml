    <text type="Uniform Commercial Code Comment"><strong>Purposes:</strong> This section is limited to tangible documents of title as the concept of indorsement is irrelevant to electronic documents of title. Electronic documents of title will be transferred by delivery of control.  Section 7-106. The indorsement of a tangible document of title is generally understood to be directed towards perfecting the transferee’s rights rather than towards assuming additional obligations. The language of the present section, however, does not preclude the one case in which an indorsement given for value guarantees future action, namely, that in which the bailee has not yet become liable upon the document at the time of the indorsement. Under such circumstances the indorser, of course, engages that appropriate honor of the document by the bailee will occur. See  Section 7-502(a)(4) as to negotiable delivery orders. However, even in such a case, once the bailee attorns to the transferee, the indorser’s obligation has been fulfilled and the policy of this section excludes any continuing obligation on the part of the indorser for the bailee’s ultimate actual performance.</text>
