    <text type="Uniform Commercial Code Comment"><strong>Purposes:</strong> With respect to subsection (b) there is a certain amount of ambiguity in the reference to when goods are designated, e.g., when the lessor is both selling and leasing goods to the same lessee/buyer and has marked goods for delivery but has not distinguished between those related to the lease contract and those related to the sales contract. As in  Section 2-501(1)(b), this issue has been left to be resolved by the courts, case by case.</text>
    <text type="Uniform Commercial Code Comment"><strong>Changes:</strong> This section, together with Section 2A-218, is derived from the provisions of  Section 2-501, with changes to reflect lease terminology; however, this section omits as irrelevant to leasing practice the treatment of special property.</text>
