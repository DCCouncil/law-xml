        <text>And it does not require delivery at a particular destination, the risk of loss passes to the lessee when the goods are duly delivered to the carrier; but</text>

      <para>
        <num>(B)</num>
        <text>If it does require delivery at a particular destination and the goods are there duly tendered while in the possession of the carrier, the risk of loss passes to the lessee when the goods are there duly so tendered as to enable the lessee to take delivery.</text>

    <text type="Uniform Commercial Code Comment"><strong>Purposes:</strong> Subsection (1) states rules related to retention or passage of risk of loss consistent with current practice in lease transactions. The provisions of subsection (4) of  Section 2-509 are not incorporated as they are not necessary. This section does not deal with responsibility for loss caused by the wrongful act of either the lesser or the lessee.</text>
    <text type="Uniform Commercial Code Comment"><strong>Changes:</strong> Subsection (1) is new. The introduction to subsection (2) is new, but subparagraph (a) incorporates the provisions of  Section 2-509(1); subparagraph (b) incorporates the provisions of  Section 2-509(2) only in part, reflecting current practice in lease transactions.</text>
