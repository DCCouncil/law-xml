    <text type="Uniform Commercial Code Comment">4. Continuation Statements. A continuation statement may be filed only within the six months immediately before lapse. See  Section 9-515(d). The filing office is obligated to reject a continuation statement that is filed outside the six-month period. See  Sections 9-520(a),  9-516(b)(7). Subsection (c) provides that if the filing office fails to reject a continuation statement that is not filed in a timely manner, the continuation statement is ineffective nevertheless.</text>
    <text type="Uniform Commercial Code Comment">A termination statement is filed pursuant to B’s authorization. Although the effectiveness of the financing statement terminates with respect to B’s security interest, A’s rights are unaffected. That is, the financing statement continues to be effective to perfect A’s security interest.</text>
    <text type="Uniform Commercial Code Comment">Example 3: Debtor creates a security interest in favor of A and B. The financing statement names A and B as the secured parties.</text>
    <text type="Uniform Commercial Code Comment">Example 2: Debtor creates a security interest in favor of A and B. The filed financing statement names A and B as the secured parties. An amendment deleting some collateral covered by the financing statement is filed pursuant to B’s authorization. Although B’s security interest in the deleted collateral becomes unperfected, A’s security interest remains perfected in all the collateral.</text>
    <text type="Uniform Commercial Code Comment">3. Multiple Secured Parties of Record.  Section 9-509(e) permits any secured party of record to authorize the filing of most amendments. Subsection (b) of this section prevents a filing authorized by one secured party of record from affecting the rights and powers of another secured party of record without the latter’s consent.</text>
    <text type="Uniform Commercial Code Comment">Example 1: Debtor authorizes the filing of a financing statement covering inventory. Under  Section 9-509, the secured party may file a financing statement covering only inventory; it may not file a financing statement covering other collateral. The secured party files a financing statement covering inventory and equipment. This section provides that the financing statement is effective only to the extent the secured party may file it. Thus, the financing statement is effective to perfect a security interest in inventory but ineffective to perfect a security interest in equipment.</text>
    <text type="Uniform Commercial Code Comment">2. Ineffectiveness of Unauthorized or Overbroad Filings. Subsection (a) provides that a filed financing statement is effective only to the extent it was filed by a person entitled to file it.</text>
