    <text>If any importer fails, refuses, or neglects to file the monthly report, or to pay the tax within the time required by this subchapter, the Mayor shall promptly notify the importer and the bonding company by notice sent by registered mail or by certified mail to such importer requiring him to show cause why the license should not be revoked. If in the opinion of the Assessor the importer fails within 10 days after the mailing of such notice to show that failure to file the monthly report or to pay the tax as the case may be within the time required was due to accident or justifiable oversight, the Assessor shall forthwith revoke such license. Any importer whose license has been revoked shall not be issued another license for 12 months following the date of said revocation.</text>
