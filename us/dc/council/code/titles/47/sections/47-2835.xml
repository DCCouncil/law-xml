Any person who goes from house to house, or place to place, within the District of Columbia, selling or taking orders for or offering to sell or take orders for goods, wares, merchandise, or any article or thing of value for future delivery, or for services to be performed in the future or for the making, manufacturing, or repairing of any article or thing whatsoever for future delivery, and requiring or accepting a deposit for such future delivery or service, shall be deemed to be a “solicitor,” within the meaning of this section; provided, however, that this definition shall not apply to persons selling goods, wares, merchandise, or any article or thing of value for resale to retailers in that commodity.
