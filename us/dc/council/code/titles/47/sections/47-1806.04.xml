    <text>The amount of tax payable under this subchapter by a resident of the District in respect to the taxable year shall be reduced by a credit equal to the amount of individual income tax such individual is required to pay and, in fact, has paid to any state, territory or possession of the United States, or political subdivision thereof, upon income attributable to such state, territory or possession of the United States, or political subdivision thereof, for such taxable year or portion thereof while concurrently a resident of the District. The credit provided under this subsection shall not exceed the proportion of the tax otherwise due under this chapter that the amount of the individual’s adjusted gross income received by him, or accrued to him if on an accrual basis, subject to tax in the other jurisdiction bears to his entire adjusted gross income received by him, or accrued to him, while he was concurrently a resident of the District. The Mayor may require satisfactory proof of the payment of such income taxes to another jurisdiction. The credit provided by this subsection shall not be allowed against any tax imposed under §§ <cite path="§47-1808.01">47-1808.01</cite> through <cite path="§47-1808.06">47-1808.06</cite>. Beginning with any taxable year after December 31, 1990, no franchise tax, license tax, excise tax, unincorporated business tax, occupation tax, or any tax characterized as such by the other taxing jurisdiction, even if applied to earned or business income, shall qualify as a credit under this section.</text>
