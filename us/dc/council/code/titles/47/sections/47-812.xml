    <text>The Council, after public hearing, shall by October 15 of each year establish, by act, rates of taxation, by class, as provided in <cite path="§47-813">§ 47-813</cite>, and the rates shall be applied, during the tax year, to the assessed value of all real property subject to taxation. The Council, acting by resolution, may extend the time for establishing the rates of taxation. If the Council does extend the time for establishing the rates of taxation on real property, it must establish those rates for the tax year by permanent legislation. If the Council does not establish the rates of taxation of real property by October 15, and does not extend the time for establishing rates, the rates of taxation applied for the prior year shall be the rates of taxation applied during the tax year.</text>
