    <text>Where any cigarette or alcoholic beverage tax stamps issued under District of Columbia tax laws have been spoiled, destroyed, or rendered useless or unfit for the purpose intended, or for which the owner may have no use, the amount paid for such stamps may be refunded within the limit of appropriations therefor, or allowed as a credit on the purchase of new stamps. No such refund or allowance shall be made unless the owner of such stamps shall file a written claim therefor with the Mayor of the District of Columbia or his designated agent within the time prescribed in this section and unless the Mayor or his designated agent upon receipt of satisfactory evidence of the facts, and subject to regulations prescribed by the Council of the District of Columbia, certifies that such refund or allowance is just and equitable.</text>
