    <annotation type="Editor's Notes">Although Law 18-341 did not contain a provision requiring that the fiscal effect of Law 18-341 be included in an approved budget and financial plan in order for Law 18-341 to apply as law, the Budget Director of the Council of the District of Columbia has determined, as of February 15, 2012, that the fiscal effect of Law 18-341 has not been included in an approved budget and financial plan. Therefore, the provisions of this section, enacted by Law 18-341, are not in effect.</annotation>
    <annotation type="Effect of Amendments"><cite doc="D.C. Law 18-341">D.C. Law 18-341</cite>, in par. (6), designated the lead-in text as subpar. (A), redesignated former subpars. (A), (B), and (C) as sub-subpars. (i), (ii), and (iii), and added subpar. (B).</annotation>
    <annotation type="Effect of Amendments"><cite doc="D.C. Law 18-55">D.C. Law 18-55</cite> rewrote par.
