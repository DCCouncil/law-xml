Members of the boards shall serve until their successor is appointed. Members may be appointed to succeed themselves, provided, however, that no member shall be appointed to serve more than 3 full consecutive 3-year terms. The terms of members of a board, after the initial terms, shall expire on the third anniversary of the date the first members constituting a quorum take the oath of office. A vacancy on a board shall be filled in the same manner as the original appointment was made. A member appointed to fill a vacancy shall serve until the expiration of the term or until a successor is appointed and sworn into office, whichever is later.</text>
