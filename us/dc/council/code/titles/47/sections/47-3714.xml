    <text>Except as may be otherwise provided in the decedent’s will, whenever it appears upon any settlement of accounts or in any other appropriate action or proceeding that a person acting in a fiduciary capacity has paid an estate tax levied or assessed under the provisions of the estate tax law of the District or the United States upon or with respect to any property required to be included in the gross estate of a decedent under the provisions of either law, the amount of the tax so paid shall be prorated among the persons interested in the estate to whom the property is or may be transferred or to whom any benefit accrues. Apportionment shall be made in the proportion that the value of the property, interest, or benefit of each person bears to the total value of the property, interests, and benefits received by all persons interested in the estate, except that in making proration each person shall have the benefit of any exemptions, deductions, and exclusions allowed by law in respect of the persons or the property passing to him or her.</text>
