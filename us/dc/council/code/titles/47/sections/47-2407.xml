    <text>The Mayor may, upon receipt of satisfactory evidence of the facts, redeem any stamps, issued under this chapter, which have been spoiled, destroyed, or rendered useless or unfit for the purpose intended, or for which the owner may have no use. Such redemption may be made either by allowing the owner of such stamps a credit on the purchase of new stamps equal to the amount paid for the spoiled, destroyed, or useless stamps or by refunding such amount; provided, that no refund shall be made in those cases where the owner can be made whole by allowing a credit on the purchase of new stamps. No refund or allowance shall be made under this section unless the owner of such stamps has filed a written claim, under oath, for such refund or allowance with the Mayor within 6 months after the stamps were spoiled, destroyed, or rendered useless or unfit for the purposes intended, or, in the case of the stamps for which the owner has no use, within 6 months after the purchase of such stamps.</text>
