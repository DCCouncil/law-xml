Such application must be made by the person upon whom such tax was imposed and who has actually paid the tax. Application for a refund as herein provided shall be deemed an application for a revision of tax, penalty, and/or interest complained of and the Mayor may receive evidence with respect thereto. After making his determination of whether any refund shall be made, the Mayor shall give notice thereof to the applicant.</text>
