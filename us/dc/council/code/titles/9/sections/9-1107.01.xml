    <annotation type="Change in Government">This section originated at a time when local government powers were delegated to a Board of Commissioners of the District of Columbia (see Acts Relating to the Establishment of the District of Columbia and its Various Forms of Governmental Organization in Volume 1). Section 402(425) of Reorganization Plan No. 3 of 1967 (see Reorganization Plans in Volume 1) transferred all of the functions of the Board of Commissioners under this section to the District of Columbia Council, subject to the right of the Commissioner as provided in § 406 of the Plan. The District of Columbia Self-Government and Governmental Reorganization Act, 87 Stat. 818, § 711 ( D.C. Code, <cite path="§1-207.11">§ 1-207.11</cite>), abolished the District of Columbia Council and the Office of Commissioner of the District of Columbia. These branches of government were replaced by the Council of the District of Columbia and the Office of Mayor of the District of Columbia, respectively. Accordingly, and also pursuant to § 714(a) of such Act ( D.C. Code, <cite path="§1-207.14|(a)">§ 1-207.14(a)</cite>), appropriate changes in terminology were made in this section.</annotation>

    <text type="Editor's Notes">Policy of Congress: Section 805 of the Act of December 15, 1971, 85 Stat. 659, Pub.

    <text type="Editor's Notes">Execution of Compact: The Compact set forth in this section was signed as follows: By the Governor of Maryland, November 17, 1966; by the Governor of Virginia, November 21, 1966; and by the President of the Board of Commissioners of the District of Columbia, November 22, 1966.</text>
    <text type="Editor's Notes">Although the District of Columbia, the Commonwealth of Virginia, and the State of Maryland passed legislation amending various portions of the Compact in 1983-1984, Congress did not act upon these changes until 1988. Congressional approval was granted pursuant to H.J. Res. 480, Pub. L. 100-285, April 7, 1988. The Legislative History of H.J. Res. 480, H.R. Rep. 521, 100th Cong., 2d. Sess., explains that “H.J. Res. 480 represents the amendments ratified by each of the three jurisdictions which are substantially similar. . . . [P]rovisions which are not substantially similar are not included in H.J. Res. 480, and are therefore not granted the consent of the Congress.” The version of § 76(e) as passed by the Council was not included in the Resolution because there were discrepancies between the provisions adopted by the District and that adopted by Maryland and Virginia. Since Congress did not enact the amended version of § 76(e), the 1976 version as set out above is still in effect. This version, which was enacted pursuant to Pub. L. 94-306, is contained in the Washington Metropolitan Area Transit Authority Compact (1988 ed.) published by WMATA.</text>
