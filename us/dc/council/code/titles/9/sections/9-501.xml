    <annotation type="Change in Government">This section originated at a time when local government powers were delegated to a Board of Commissioners of the District of Columbia (see Acts Relating to the Establishment of the District of Columbia and its Various Forms of Governmental Organization in Volume 1). Section 401 of Reorganization Plan No. 3 of 1967 (see Reorganization Plans in Volume 1) transferred all of the functions of the Board of Commissioners under this section to a single Commissioner. The District of Columbia Self-Government and Governmental Reorganization Act, 87 Stat. 818, ยงโ711 ( D.C. Code, <cite path="ยง1-207.11">ยง 1-207.11</cite>), abolished the District of Columbia Council and the Office of Commissioner of the District of Columbia. These branches of government were replaced by the Council of the District of Columbia and the Office of Mayor of the District of Columbia, respectively. Accordingly, and also pursuant to ยงโ714(a) of such Act ( D.C. Code, <cite path="ยง1-207.14|(a)">ยง 1-207.14(a)</cite>), appropriate changes in terminology were made in this section.</annotation>
    <annotation type="Editor's Notes">Payment for street lighting and traffic signal costs: Section 130(a) of Pub. L. 98-125 provided that payment for street lighting and traffic signal costs shall be made by the Mayor monthly for each calendar month during fiscal year 1984, except for any month covered by a program (1) which provides for such expenses to be borne by the ratepayers of the electric utility involved and (2) for which all final administrative and judicial determinations have been made. Section 130(b) of Pub. L. 98-125 provided that except for funds set apart exclusively for, or administratively apportioned for, eliminating the cash portion of the General Fund accumulated deficit, appropriations under the District of Columbia Appropriation Act, 1984, shall be available to the Mayor for purposes of ยงโ130(a).</annotation>
