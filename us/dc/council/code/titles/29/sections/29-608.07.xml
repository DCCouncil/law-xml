    <text>Each partner shall be entitled to a settlement of all partnership accounts upon winding up the partnership activities and affairs. In settling accounts among the partners, profits and losses that result from the liquidation of the partnership assets shall be credited and charged to the partners’ accounts. The partnership shall make a distribution to a partner in an amount equal to any excess of the credits over the charges in the partner’s account. A partner shall contribute to the partnership an amount equal to any excess of the charges over the credits in the partner’s account but excluding from the calculation charges attributable to an obligation for which the partner is not personally liable under <cite path="§29-603.06">§ 29-603.06</cite>.</text>

    <text>If a partner fails to contribute the full amount required under subsection (b) of this section, all of the other partners shall contribute, in the proportions in which those partners share partnership losses, the additional amount necessary to satisfy the partnership obligations for which they are personally liable under <cite path="§29-603.06">§ 29-603.06</cite>. A partner or partner’s legal representative may recover from the other partners any contributions the partner makes to the extent the amount contributed exceeds that partner’s share of the partnership obligations for which the partner is personally liable under <cite path="§29-603.06">§ 29-603.06</cite>.</text>
