In this case, a member remains immune from liability for debts, obligations, and other liabilities of the corporation under <cite path="§29-404.12">§ 29-404.12</cite> and shall be liable only to the extent that the member’s failure to pay amounts owed to the corporation has resulted in damages to the creditor.</text>
