    <text>A person does not have a right to demand or receive a distribution from a partnership in any form other than money. Except as otherwise provided in <cite path="§29-608.09">§ 29-608.09</cite>, a partnership may distribute an asset in kind only if each part of the asset is fungible with each other part and each person receives a percentage of the asset equal in value to the person’s share of distributions.</text>

    <text>If a partner or transferee becomes entitled to receive a distribution, the partner or transferee has the status of, and is entitled to all remedies available to, a creditor of the partnership with respect to the distribution. However, the partnership’s obligation to make a distribution is subject to offset for any amount owed to the partnership by the partner or a person dissociated as partner on whose account the distribution is made.</text>
