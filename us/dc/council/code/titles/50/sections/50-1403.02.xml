    <text>The Mayor shall revoke the motor vehicle operator’s permit of a District resident or the privilege to operate a motor vehicle in the District of a nonresident, convicted as a result of the commission of a drug offense or adjudicated a juvenile delinquent as a result of the commission of a drug offense. Where the person is imprisoned as a result of the drug offense, the revocation shall occur following the person’s release from imprisonment. If a person does not have an operator’s permit, or the permit is or has been revoked or suspended at the time of the conviction of a drug offense, the issuance or reinstatement of an operator’s permit will be delayed for a period of at least 6 months and not more than 2 years. If a person is convicted for the commission of a drug offense or adjudicated a delinquent for the commission of a drug offense before the person is 16 years of age, the period of disqualification shall not begin to run until the person is 16 years of age. Notification of the conviction or adjudication shall be sent electronically by the court to the Mayor within one business day of the conviction or adjudication and shall include the person’s name, address, date of birth, conviction date, driver’s license number, if any, social security number, if any, the offense, and any other information required by the Mayor to take the action required by this section. The revocation shall be for not less than six months and not more than 2 years. For the purposes of this section, notwithstanding any other District law, a violation of <cite path="§48-1201">§ 48-1201</cite> shall not constitute a drug offense.</text>
