    <text>The Director of the District Department of Transportation (“Director”) shall exempt particular neighborhoods from Saturday meter enforcement where the Director determines that Saturday meter enforcement would not be in the public interest. In making such a determination, the Director shall consider whether Saturday meter enforcement is necessary to maintain available curbside parking; provided, that by October 15, 2009, the Director shall submit to the Council for approval, by resolution, the neighborhoods to be exempted from Saturday enforcement and the criteria used to exempt each neighborhood. Nothing in this subsection may be implemented until the Council affirmatively approves the submission of the Director.</text>
