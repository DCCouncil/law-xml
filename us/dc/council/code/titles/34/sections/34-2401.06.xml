    <text>The Mayor, with prior written notice to the owner of the date and time of entry, and consistent with constitutional guidelines, may enter any building, establishment, or other premises furnished water or sanitary sewer service. If the Mayor is unable to gain entry to the real property after 2 attempts, the Mayor shall notify the owner or occupant to contact the Department within 3 business days after notice is mailed to the owner. If the owner or occupant fails to contact the Department, it shall be presumed that the owner or occupant refuses to permit entry to the property and the Mayor may impose a penalty of $100 and shut off the water supply to the real property.
