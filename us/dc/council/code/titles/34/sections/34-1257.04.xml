    <text>A cable operator shall use existing poles, conduits, and other facilities whenever possible, and shall not construct or install any new, different, or additional poles, conduits, or other facilities without the approval of the District.

The cable operator shall at all times employ ordinary care and shall install and maintain in use commonly accepted methods and devices for preventing failures and accidents that are likely to cause damage, injuries, or nuisances to the public. Any pole or other fixture placed in a public right-of-way by the cable operator shall be placed in a manner that does not interfere with the usual travel on the public right-of-way.</text>
