  <heading>Transfer or purchase of franchise after denial of renewal.</heading>
  <text>Except if there is a pending appeal, or the decision is stayed by a judicial or administrative review, upon a decision by the Council to deny a renewal, the Council may, on the expiration date of the franchise, either authorize the District to purchase the assets of the cable operator’s cable system at a price not to exceed fair market value with no value allocated to the franchise itself, or the Council may select another person, after a public hearing, and cause that person to purchase the assets at a price not to exceed fair market value.</text>
