  <annotations>
    <annotation type="Mayor's Statement">
      <text>The Department of Human Resources was created in 1970 by the merger of the Departments of Vocational Rehabilitation, Public Health, Public Welfare, and Veterans Affairs. Its resources now include approximately 8,000 employees and a budget of over $440 million.</text>
      <text>The purpose of this consolidation was to assure that public health and social services programs responded to the needs of individuals and families in an integrated and holistic fashion. The structure was intended to enable citizens to obtain in unified centers the information, forms, and counseling they required to participate in programs to which they were entitled. It would also enable managers to coordinate and take account of all the factors that should go into policies and decisions about resources and priorities.</text>
      <text>However, this valid and important promise has never been fully realized. Nor has the quality of health care, rehabilitation services, income maintenance programs, and child, youth and family services over this decade been as high as the citizens of the District expect and deserve.</text>
      <text>One of the chief goals of this Administration is to improve and coordinate those services. The heart of any government lies in the quality of its response to people in need. Citizens of the District have the right to expect prompt access to public services when they need them and are eligible to receive them, in a straightforward and courteous setting. Guidelines for services should be clear and available to everyone. Moreover, the quality of public services should be as high as the quality of private services. It is our responsibility to use the planning, regulating and priority setting powers of government to achieve uniform high standards of health care and social services, so that those who need financial help are not relegated to separate and low quality systems. Equally important, it is the job of government to encourage private provision of human services wherever possible, and to be sure that those private professionals who share in public services benefit from an efficient and responsive partnership with government.</text>
      <text>I have therefore examined our deficiencies in respect to these goals of accessibility, quality and cost-effectiveness. I have particularly questioned the extent to which the organizational size and structure of the Department of Human Resources accounts for the difficulties which clients and service providers encounter, and what structural changes would cure these deficiencies.</text>
      <text>It was my initial judgment that the most effective way to proceed would be to reduce the size of the departmental bureaucracy and to assure clear focus for independent advocacy of health needs in the District by creating an independent health authority. My transition policy team cautioned me, however, that the issues related to such a separation were complex, and that an immediate organizational decision of this kind would not necessarily accomplish my purpose.</text>
      <text>Therefore, early this year I created a special task force under the leadership of Dr. Arthur Hoyte to draw up the functional components of an independent health department, and to assess the impact of such a change on health care in the District. Concurrently we have explored other alternatives, carrying out with leadership in the Department of Human Resources, with members of the executive staff, and with community and professional leadership an intensive examination of policy and management issues. We have reviewed the two recent major analyses of the Department, one carried out in 1977 by a Mayor's Panel on the Organization and Management of Human Resources Programs, and the other in 1978 by a City Council Task Force on the Reorganization of the Department of Human Resources.</text>
      <text>My conclusion is that in order to overcome the deficiencies which now exist in human services programs we must proceed through several stages. The Department of Human Resources is large and complex; it accounts for over one-third of our operating department budget. It carries out many state responsibilities that have dramatically changed and increased over the last decade; its internal administrative structure is not well suited to these changing requirements for state planning and accountability for federal funds. Internal management procedures are weak; the department lacks mechanisms to produce integration of policy, planning and operational decisions at the appropriate level.</text>
      <text>I am therefore proposing at this time a reorganization which addresses these immediate problems. I believe that we must concentrate on internal administrative and management reorganization before fundamental program and public policy decisions can be effectively staffed and appropriately debated.</text>
      <text>I am aware that the organized medical community would prefer to move forward at once to an independent health department. Many agree with me, however, that such a separation would not in itself guarantee an improvement in services, and have expressed their willingness to support these internal management improvements as a first step. We are agreed that my proposal does not preclude the alternative of a separate department in the future, if implementation of this Reorganization Plan does not produce the improvement in health care policy formulation and services which is our common goal.</text>
      <text>This Reorganization Plan therefore contains the first two steps in what I expect to be a continuing evaluation and improvement in health and social services in the District.</text>
      <text class="centered">PHASE ONE</text>
      <text>The first step, which will take place immediately upon Council approval, thoroughly restructures senior management responsibility and accountability within the Department. It brings together under the authority of those managers the staff and budget resources which will enable them to meet newly defined responsibility to coordinate planning, policy formulation, and implementation of programs.</text>
      <text>I propose to reemphasize the ultimate goal of the agency by renaming it the Department of Human Services. The Director of the Department will have fewer direct administrative responsibilities, and a stronger mandate to shape overall public policy and service coordination, as well as to set and impose a far higher standard of management performance throughout the agency.</text>
      <text>At the most senior level of the Department the Reorganization Plan creates two new key positions:</text>
      <text>In order to achieve a consolidated point of accountability for health care policy and service delivery, and a focus for a more productive engagement of the private sector in public policy decisions, the Plan calls for a Commissioner of Public Health. The responsibilities of that Commissioner will include the grouping of programs now found in three of the Department's administrations and in parts of Executive Direction and Support. I have chosen to include authority for health, mental health, and drug and alcohol abuse services under a single Commissioner in order to emphasize my belief that the health of the body and of the mind are closely related. I expect the planning and implementation of each program area to be improved, and all of them properly coordinated to meet the health and mental health needs of District citizens.</text>
      <text>The Reorganization Plan proposes a corresponding position of Commissioner of Social Services, with a unified responsibility at the most senior level for rehabilitation programs, income assistance programs, and the services provided to children, youth and families. In consolidating new leadership for social services, I will require a more productive partnership with the federal government and the private sector, and more efficient use of District resources.</text>
      <text>The creation of these two key positions is accompanied by the dismantling of the Office of State Agency Affairs and the Office of Planning and Evaluation. The offices of the five line administrators (Community Health and Hospitals, Mental Health, Substance Abuse, Social Rehabilitation, and Payments Assistance) are also converted to a different configuration of responsibilities. As a result, the total number of executive level positions in the Department will not be increased.</text>
      <text>This initial realignment of senior executive staff and program offices will produce several immediate benefits:</text>
      <text>It will put the necessary staff and budget resources in the hands of senior program managers who have responsibility for shaping policy recommendations and administrative services.</text>
      <text>It will allow the Director of Commissioners to focus on long-range planning, policy and management concerns.</text>
      <text>It will provide a clear focus for discussion and development of health care and social services policy issues.</text>
      <text>It will allow for increased emphasis on policy initiatives such as health promotion, promotion of dental care, reduction of infant mortality rates, and consolidation of programs for youth.</text>
      <text>It will allow more effective involvement of officials at the program level with those at the planning and evaluation level, to the advantage of both.</text>
      <text>It will assure better integration of federal and District resources in the achievement of program objectives, and hold program managers accountable for compliance with local, state, and federal policies and procedures.</text>
      <text class="centered">PHASE TWO</text>
      <text>The remainder of FY 1980 will be devoted to completing and refining this Reorganization Plan. In the process each major administration, bureau, and office will be reviewed and restructured to achieve clearer and more accountable job definitions for middle management personnel, and to implement important policy objectives detailed in the plan. Additional benefits will flow from this phase of the plan:</text>
      <text>Improved relationships between program administrators and federal officials.</text>
      <text>Timely compliance in carrying out state and local planning functions.</text>
      <text>Better linkage of budget preparation to the planning process, and to policy priorities.</text>
      <text>Increased program accountability to the public, the Mayor and legislators.</text>
      <text>Improved administrative procedures for data collection, needs assessment, facilities management, contracting and procurement.</text>
      <text>Implementation of performance standards for personnel.</text>
      <text>Assurance of compliance with federal and local legislation and regulations governing the Department.</text>
      <text>Improved standard setting and regulation of facilities.</text>
      <text>Coordination of services to avoid duplication and encourage the most cost-effective programs.</text>
      <text>Improved response to legal challenges in respect to services, and implementation of relevant court orders.</text>
      <text class="centered">FUTURE STEPS</text>
      <text>This Reorganization Plan does not alter the overall functions and responsibilities of the Department, nor does it represent any change in present budget allocations for programs or policy priorities already established in the FY 1980 budget. It does alter the distribution of management resources and responsibilities, and thus provides the basis on which better policy and resource allocation recommendations can rationally and publicly be made in the coming months.</text>
      <text>Because policy focus and advocacy will be more visibly located, citizens and Council members can have more effective access to decision makers within the Department. Because operational accountability is more specific, the City Administrator will be able to apply the management performance standards which we are generating throughout the government.</text>
      <text>The effective delivery of health care and social services, in a time of budget constraints and increasing urban needs, is a challenge to every major city in the United States. I submit that this Reorganization Plan is the necessary next step in my continuing commitment to achieving accessible, high quality and cost-effective human services in the District of Columbia.</text>
