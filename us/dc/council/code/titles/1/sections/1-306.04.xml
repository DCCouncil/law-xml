    <text>Continuous community input into every phase of development of titles I through XII of section 3 (the “Comprehensive Plan”), from conception to adoption to implementation, is essential to assure that the Comprehensive Plan in all its elements is the valid expression of District residents, property owners, commercial interests, and other groups and individuals in the District. A variety of means to secure community input should be utilized, including advisory and technical committees, community workshops, review of draft texts, public forums and hearings, and other means of discussion and communication. The District government, through its executive and legislative branches, will strive to ensure that the Comprehensive Plan, in all its elements, is both responsive and responsible.</text>
