    <text type="Editor's Notes">Section 203 of D.C. Law 19-120 amended section 202 of D.C. Law 18-160 to read as follows: “Sec. 202. Applicability. Section 201 shall apply upon its ratification by a majority of the registered qualified electors of the District of Columbia voting in a referendum held for such purpose and a 35-day period of Congressional review as provided in section 303 of the District of Columbia Home Rule Act, approved December 24, 1973 (87 Stat. 784; D.C. Official Code <cite path="§1-203.03">§ 1-203.03</cite>), and publication in the District of Columbia Register.”.</text>
    <text type="Editor's Notes">Law 18-160 not applicable: D.C. Law 18-160 contained an applicability clause for section 201 of the Act that, after amendment by emergency Act 18-443, temporary Law 18-224, and emergency Act 19-51, purported that section 201 would become law upon its ratification by a majority of the registered qualified electors of the District of Columbia voting in a referendum pursuant to section 303 of the District of Columbia Home Rule Act (HRA) and 35 days of congressional review. D.C. Law 18-160 purported to add a paragraph (16) to this section (<cite path="§1-201.03">§ 1-201.03</cite>) by referendum. The HRA does not allow this section to be amended by referendum.</text>
    <text type="Editor's Notes">Application of § 301(a)(1) of Pub. L. 104-8: Section 301(a)(2) of Pub. L. 104-8, 109 Stat. 142, provided that the amendments made by paragraph (a)(1) shall apply with respect to revenues, resources, and budgets of the District of Columbia for fiscal years beginning with fiscal year 1996.</text>
