    <text>The provisions of this section shall become effective on January 1, 1980, and shall apply to all employees, including employees described in <cite path="§1-602.04">§ 1-602.04</cite>, of a particular occupational group who are represented by a labor organization which has been granted exclusive recognition under this chapter by the Board.
