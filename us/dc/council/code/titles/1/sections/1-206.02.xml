    <text type="Editor's Notes">Waiver of Congressional review for certain revenue bond acts: Section 136(a) of H.R. 3067, amended by H.R. 99-419, incorporated in Pub. L. 99-190 by § 101(c), the D.C. Appropriation Act, 1986, provided that § 602(c) of the Self-Government Act (Pub. L. 93-198) shall not apply to certain acts authorizing the issuance of revenue bonds. Section 136(b) of H.R. 3067 provided that the subject revenue bond acts shall take effect on the date of enactment of the act. Pub. L. 99-190 was approved Dec. 19, 1985. The revenue bond acts subject to waiver of review, set forth in § 136(c) of H.R. 3067, are The Georgetown University Higher Education Facilities Revenue Bond Act of 1985 (<cite doc="D.C. Law 6-75">D.C. Law 6-75</cite>), The Sibley Memorial Hospital Revenue Bond Act of 1985 (<cite doc="D.C. Law 6-70">D.C. Law 6-70</cite>), The Forrest Marbury House Project Revenue Bond Act of 1985 (<cite doc="D.C. Law 6-86">D.C. Law 6-86</cite>), The American University Revenue Bond Act of 1985 (<cite doc="D.C. Law 6-78">D.C. Law 6-78</cite>), and The George Washington University Revenue Bond Act of 1985 (<cite doc="D.C. Law 6-79">D.C. Law 6-79</cite>). D.C. Schedule of Heights Amendment disapproved by Congress: Pursuant to Pub. L. 102-11, 105 Stat. 33, effective March 12, 1991, it was resolved by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States of America in Congress assembled, that the Congress hereby disapproves of the action of the District of Columbia Council described as follows: The Schedule of Heights Amendment Act of 1990 (D.C. Act 8-329), signed by the Mayor of the District of Columbia on December 27, 1990, and transmitted to Congress pursuant to section 602(c)(1) of the District of Columbia Self-Government and Governmental Reorganization Act on January 15, 1991.</text>
    <text type="Editor's Notes">Section 2 of Pub. L. 99-216 also waived Congressional review for D.C. Laws 6-75 and 6-70, providing that they take effect on the date of enactment of the public law, which was approved Dec. 26, 1985.</text>
    <text type="Editor's Notes">Waiver of Congressional review for certain revenue bond acts: Section 1 of Pub. L. 99-242 amended § 2 of Pub. L. 99-216 to include also D.C. Laws 6-78 and 6-79. Section 2 provided that they should take effect as if included in Pub. L. 99-216, with certain restrictions.</text>
    <text type="Congressional Disapproval of Acts of the Council">By the time the Council transmitted Act 8-329 to Congress, the Supreme Court had decided, in Immigration and Naturalization Service v. Chada, 462 U.S. 919, 103 S. Ct. 2764 (1983), that a provision of the Immigration and Naturalization Act that allowed one House of Congress to invalidate a decision of the Executive Branch violated the constitutional doctrine of separation of powers. Congress amended the Home Rule Act to conform with the Chada decision. Section 602 was amended to require that in order to disapprove an act of the Council, both Houses of Congress must pass a joint resolution that would then require the signature of the President. Act 8-329 was disapproved by joint resolution of Congress and signature of the President and became Public Law 102-11.</text>
    <text type="Congressional Disapproval of Acts of the Council">Act 4-69 would have amended titles 22 and 23 of the District of Columbia Code. At the time of the disapproval, section 602(c)(2) provided that either House of Congress could adopt a resolution disapproving an act of the Council that amended or would be codified in titles 22, 23, or 24. Act 4-69 was disapproved by one House of Congress, the House of Representatives, in H.Res.208.</text>
    <text type="Congressional Disapproval of Acts of the Council">At the time of the disapproval of the first act, section 602(c)(1) of the Home Rule Act required both Houses of Congress to adopt a concurrent resolution disapproving the act. Act 3-120 was disapproved by both Houses of Congress in S.Con.Res.63 (in Lieu of H.Con.Res.228).</text>
    <text type="Congressional Disapproval of Acts of the Council">(3) The Schedule of Heights Amendment Act of 1990, Act 8-329, adopted on final reading by the Council December 18, 1990, signed by the Mayor December 27, 1990 ( 38 DCR 369). The disapproval was effective on March 21, 1991.</text>
    <text type="Congressional Disapproval of Acts of the Council">(2) The District of Columbia Sexual Assault Reform Act of 1981, D.C. Act 4-69, adopted on final reading by the Council July 14, 1981, signed by the Mayor July 2, 1981 ( 28 DCR 3409). Disapproval was effective October 1, 1981.</text>
    <text type="Congressional Disapproval of Acts of the Council">(1) The Location of Chanceries Act of 1979, D.C. Act 3-120, adopted on final reading by the Council October 9, 1979, signed by the Mayor November 9, 1979 ( 26 DCR 2188). Disapproval was effective December 20, 1979.</text>
