    <text>An employee of another government or organization who is detailed to a District agency may not by virtue of the detail be considered to be an employee of the District, except as provided in this section, nor may he or she be directly paid a salary or wage by the District agency. The assignment agreement may, however, authorize the District agency to reimburse the sending agency or organization for all or any part of the employee’s salary and fringe benefits.

An employee of a sending agency or organization is not entitled to benefits under that program for any period for which he or she elects similar benefits under the employee compensation program of his or her permanent employer.</text>
