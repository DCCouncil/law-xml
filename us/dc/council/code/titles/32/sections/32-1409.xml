  <heading>Apprenticeship agreements — Registration and approval; extension into majority of apprentice.</heading>
  <text>No apprenticeship agreement shall be registered or approved by the Associate Director of Apprenticeship under the provisions of this subchapter unless it conforms with the standards established by or in accordance with this subchapter and is in the best interests of the apprentice. Where a minor enters into an agreement for a period of training extending into his majority, and such agreement has been approved by the Associate Director of Apprenticeship, then such apprenticeship agreement shall, if the parties therein so provide, have the same force and effect during the period covered by the majority of such minor as if such agreement were entered into during the majority of such minor.</text>
