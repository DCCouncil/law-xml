    <text>If an employer notifies the Mayor that the employer intends to contest a citation or a proposed penalty issued under <cite path="§32-1114">§ 32-1114</cite> or notification issued under subsection (b) of this section or if, within the time period specified in <cite path="§32-1114">§ 32-1114</cite> following the issuance of a citation, an employee or employee representative files notice with the Mayor alleging that the period of time fixed in the citation for the abatement of the violation is unreasonable, the Mayor shall immediately afford the employer or employee an opportunity for a hearing and issue a decision and an order based on findings of fact and conclusions of law affirming, modifying, or vacating the citation issued by the Mayor, the time fixed in the citation for the abatement of the violation, or the proposed penalty or directing other appropriate relief.
