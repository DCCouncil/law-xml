      <text>The Director shall maintain a separate account for each employer, and shall credit his account with all of the contributions paid by him after June 30, 1939, with respect to employment subsequent to May 31, 1939; provided, that contributions received after July 1, 1981, by reason of the solvency tax set forth in paragraph (4)(B)(ii) of this subsection shall not be credited to the separate account of each employer. Each year the Director shall credit to each of such accounts having a positive reserve on the computation date, the interest earned from the federal government in the following manner: Each year the ratio of the credit balance in each individual account to the total of all the credit balances in all employer accounts shall be computed as of such computation date, and an amount equal to the interest credited to the District’s account in the Unemployment Trust Fund in the Treasury of the United States for the 4 most recently completed calendar quarters shall be credited prior to the next computation date on the pro rata basis to all employers’ accounts having a credit balance on the computation date. Such amount shall be prorated to the individual accounts in the same ratio that the credit balance in each individual account bears to the total of the credit balances in all such accounts. In computing the amount to be credited to the account of an employer as a result of interest earned by funds on deposit in the Unemployment Trust Fund in the Treasury of the United States to the account of the District, any voluntary contribution made by an employer after June 30th of any year shall not be considered a part of the account balance of the employer until the next computation date occurring after such voluntary contribution was made. Nothing in this subchapter shall be construed to grant any employer or individual in his service prior claims or rights to the amounts paid by him into the Fund either on his own behalf or on behalf of such individuals.</text>

Benefits paid to an individual on an initial claim for benefits filed after June 30, 1940, shall be charged against the accounts of his base period employers, except as specifically provided by subparagraphs (B), (C), (D), and (E) below. The amount of benefits so chargeable against each base period employer’s account shall bear the same ratio to the total benefits paid to an individual as the base period wages paid to the individual by such employer bear to the total amount of the base period wages paid to the individual by all of his base period employers. All base period employers whose accounts could be charged with benefits paid to an individual with respect to a claim made pursuant to this subchapter shall be given notice of potential charges.</text>

Each employer’s contribution rate for each subsequent year or part thereof shall be calculated on the basis of his records filed with the Director and benefit payments disbursed through the applicable computation date. The Director shall compute rates for the second 6 months of 1963 for all employers first acquiring the necessary 12 months’ benefit experience under subsection (c)(4)(A) of this section on the computation date June 30, 1963. Such rates shall be based upon such employer’s experience in the payment of contributions and benefits charged against his account through June 30, 1963, prior to the crediting of his account with Trust Fund interest. All employers issued a rate for the second 6 months of 1963, under this subsection, shall have a computation date of September 30, 1963, for the calendar year 1964.</text>

Unless such employing unit shall file the report or a correct or sufficient report, as the case may be, within 15 days after the mailing of such notice, the Director shall compute such employing unit’s rate of contribution on the basis of such estimates, and the rates so determined shall be subject to increase, but not to reduction, on the basis of subsequently ascertained information.</text>

Upon receipt of such application, the Director shall voluntarily adjust such matter or shall grant an opportunity for a fair hearing and promptly notify the employer thereof. All such hearings shall be held before a Contribution Rate Review Committee composed of 3 members who shall be employees of the Director and appointed by the Director.

The employer shall be promptly notified in writing of the Director’s denial of his application or of the Director’s redetermination. An employer aggrieved by the Director’s decision may seek review of such determination in the District of Columbia Court of Appeals in accordance with the District of Columbia Administrative Procedure Act.</text>
