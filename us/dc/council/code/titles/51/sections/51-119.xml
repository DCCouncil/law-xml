In any case in which, under this subsection, a claimant is liable to repay to the Director any sum, such sum may be collected without interest, by civil action in the name of the Director or by the collection remedy set forth in <cite path="§47-1812.11|(a)" proof="true">§ 47-1812.11(a)</cite> [repealed].
