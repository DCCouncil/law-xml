  <text>Any action challenging the validity of or arising out of acts taken or proposed to be taken under this subchapter shall be commenced within 30 days after the date of the issuance of any order by the Commissioner pursuant to this subchapter. In any action challenging the validity of or arising out of acts taken or proposed to be taken under this subchapter, or charging that the directors of the mutual insurance holding company or any of its subsidiaries have acted improperly in connection with any aspect of the acts taken or proposed to be taken under this subchapter, the mutual insurance holding company or any of its subsidiaries in whose right such action is brought, or the defendant(s) shall be entitled at any state of the proceedings before final judgment to require the plaintiff(s) to give security for the reasonable expenses, including attorney fees, which may be incurred by the mutual insurance holding company or any of its subsidiaries or any other defendant(s) in connection with such action. Thereafter, the amount of such security, from time to time, may be increased or decreased in the discretion of the court having jurisdiction of such action upon a showing that the security provided has or may become inadequate or excessive.</text>
