In the absence of such definition such term shall not include group insurance, or benefits provided by union welfare plans or by employer or employee benefit organizations.

In applying the foregoing policy provision no 3rd-party liability coverage shall be included as “other valid coverage.”</text>

The District of Columbia Self-Government and Governmental Reorganization Act, 87 Stat. 818, § 711 ( D.C.
