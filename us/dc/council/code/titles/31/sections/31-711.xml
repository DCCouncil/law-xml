  <text>Whenever it appears to the Mayor that any person has committed a violation of this subchapter which so impairs the financial condition of a domestic insurer as to threaten insolvency or make the further transaction of business by it hazardous to its policyholders, creditors, shareholders, or the public, the Commissioner may proceed as provided under the insurance laws of the District to take possession of the property of such a domestic insurer and to conduct its business, or take any other actions as the Mayor, at the Mayor’s discretion, deems appropriate.</text>
