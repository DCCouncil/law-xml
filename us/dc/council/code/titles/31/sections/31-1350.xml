    <text>The domiciliary liquidator of an insurer domiciled in a reciprocal state shall, except as to special deposits and security on secured claims under <cite path="§31-1351|(c)">§ 31-1351(c)</cite>, be vested by operation of law with the title to all of the assets, property, contracts, and rights of action, agents’ balances, and all of the books, accounts, and other records of the insurer located in the District. The date of vesting shall be the date of the filing of the petition, if that date is specified by the domiciliary law for the vesting of property in the domiciliary state. Otherwise, the date of vesting shall be the date of entry of the order directing possession to be taken. The domiciliary liquidator shall have the immediate right to recover balances due from agents and to obtain possession of the books, accounts, and other records of the insurer located in this state. He also shall have the right to recover all other assets of the insurer located in this state, subject to <cite path="§31-1351">§ 31-1351</cite>.</text>

The Commissioner may petition for a conservation or liquidation order under <cite path="§31-1348">§ 31-1348</cite> or <cite path="§31-1349">§ 31-1349</cite>, or for an ancillary receivership under <cite path="§31-1351">§ 31-1351</cite>, or, after approval by the Superior Court of the District of Columbia, may transfer title to the domiciliary liquidator, as the interests of justice and the equitable distribution of the assets require.</text>
