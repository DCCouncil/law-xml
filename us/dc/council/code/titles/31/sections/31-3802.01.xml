    <text type="Editor's Notes">“(5) The Guidelines for Perinatal Care, prepared by the American Academy of Pediatrics and the American College of Obstetrics and Gynecology, recommends a hospital stay of at least 48 hours after childbirth.</text>
    <text type="Editor's Notes">“(4) Insurers, both indemnity and managed care plans, have implemented benefit plans covering no more than 24 hours of postpartum stay in a hospital, despite little or no scientific support for the efficacy of this policy for the general population.</text>
