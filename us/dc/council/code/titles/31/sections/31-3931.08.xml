    <text>In addition to reinsurers authorized under <cite path="31|5">Chapter 5 of this title</cite>, a captive insurer or protected cell may take credit for the reinsurance of risks or portions of risks ceded to a pool, exchange, or association acting as a reinsurer which has been authorized by the Commissioner. The Commissioner may require any other documents, financial information, or other evidence that the pool, exchange, or association will be able to provide adequate security for its financial obligations. The Commissioner may deny authorization or impose any limitations on the activities of a reinsurance pool, exchange, or association that, in the Commissioner’s judgment, are necessary and proper to provide adequate security for the ceding captive insurer or protected cell and for the protection and consequent benefit of the public at large.</text>
