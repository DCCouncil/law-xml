The Commissioner shall immediately issue a written notice to the society requiring that the deficiency or deficiencies which exist are corrected. After the notice, the society shall have a 30-day period in which to comply with the Commissioner’s request for correction.  If the society fails to comply, the Commissioner shall notify the society of the findings of noncompliance and require the society to show cause on a date named why its license should not be suspended, revoked, or refused.</text>
