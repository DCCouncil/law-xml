    <text>Whenever the appropriate officials in a state party to this compact and which has entered into a contract pursuant to Article III shall decide that confinement in or transfer of an inmate to an institution within the territory of another party state is necessary or desirable in order to provide adequate quarters and care or an appropriate program of rehabilitation or treatment, the appropriate officials may direct that the confinement be within an institution within the territory of the other party state, the receiving state to act in that regard solely as agent for the sending state.</text>
    <text>The appropriate officials of any state party to this compact shall have access, at all reasonable times, to any institution in which the state has a contractual right to confine inmates for the purpose of inspecting the facilities and visiting the state’s inmates confined in the institution.</text>
    <text>Inmates confined in an institution pursuant to the terms of this compact shall at all times be subject to the jurisdiction of the sending state and may at any time be removed from the receiving state for transfer to a prison or other institution within the sending state, for transfer to another institution with which the sending state may have a contractual or other right to confine inmates, for release on probation or parole, for discharge, or for any other purpose permitted by the laws of the sending state; provided, that the sending state shall continue to be obligated to payments as may be required pursuant to the terms of any contract entered into under the terms of Article III.</text>
    <text>Each receiving state shall provide regular reports to each sending state on the inmates of that sending state in institutions pursuant to this compact, including a conduct record of each inmate, and certify the record to the appropriate official designated by the sending state, in order that each inmate may have official review of his or her record in determining and altering the disposition of the inmate in accordance with the law which may obtain in the sending state and in order that the record may be a source of information for the sending state.</text>
    <text>All inmates confined in an institution pursuant to the provisions of this compact shall be treated in a reasonable and humane manner and shall be treated equally with similar inmates of the receiving state confined in the same institution. The fact of confinement in a receiving state shall not deprive any inmate so confined of any legal rights which the inmate would have had if confined in an appropriate institution of the sending state.</text>
    <text>Any hearing to which an inmate confined pursuant to this compact may be entitled by the law of the sending state may be conducted before the appropriate authorities of the sending state, or of the receiving state if authorized by the sending state. The receiving state shall provide adequate facilities for the hearings conducted by the appropriate officials of a sending state. In the event the hearing is conducted before appropriate officials of the receiving state, the governing law shall be that of the sending state, and a record of the hearing as prescribed by the sending state shall be made. The record together with any recommendations of the hearing officials shall be transmitted immediately to the appropriate official before whom the hearing would have been conducted if it had taken place in the sending state. In all proceedings conducted pursuant to the provisions of this subsection, the appropriate officials of the receiving state shall act solely as agents of the sending state, and no final determination shall be made in any matter except by the appropriate officials of the sending state.</text>
    <text>Any inmate confined pursuant to this compact shall be released within the territory of the sending state unless the inmate and the sending and receiving states agree upon release in some other place. The sending state shall bear the cost of the return to its territory.</text>
    <text>Any inmate confined pursuant to the terms of this compact shall have all rights to participate in and derive any benefits or incur or be relieved of any obligations or have the obligations modified or a change in status on account of any action or proceeding in which he or she could have participated if confined in any appropriate institution of the sending state located within the sending state.</text>
    <text>A parent, guardian, trustee, or other person entitled under the laws of the sending state to act for, advise, or otherwise function with respect to any inmate shall not be deprived of or be restricted in the exercise of any power in respect of any inmate confined pursuant to the terms of this compact.</text>

The appropriate officials of the sending state shall be permitted to transport inmates pursuant to this compact through all states party to this compact without interference.</text>
    <text>An inmate who escapes from an institution in which he is confined pursuant to this compact shall be a fugitive from the sending state and from the receiving state.
