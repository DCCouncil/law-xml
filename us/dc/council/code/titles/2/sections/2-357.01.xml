Bid security shall be a bond provided by a surety company authorized to do business in the District or the equivalent in cash, or otherwise supplied in a form satisfactory to the District. This section shall not prevent the requirement of such bonds on such contracts under $100,000 or bid or proposal bonds on any other contracts when the circumstances warrant.</text>
