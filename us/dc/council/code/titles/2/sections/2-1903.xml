    <text>A communication-impaired person entitled to an interpreter under this chapter shall, if practicable, notify the appropriate appointing authority of the person’s need for an interpreter at least 5 business days prior to the person’s appearance. A failure to notify the appointing authority of the need for an interpreter is not a waiver of the right to an interpreter.</text>
