    <text>When a TIF area for a project is established pursuant to §§ <cite path="§2-1217.03">2-1217.03</cite> and <cite path="§2-1217.04">2-1217.04</cite>, the Assessor shall promptly determine and certify the initial assessed value of each lot of taxable property within the TIF area and the Collector shall determine and certify the initial sales tax amount for the TIF area. In certifying the initial sales tax amount, the Collector may determine, at the time of issuance of the TIF bonds that are to be secured by the sales tax increment revenues from the TIF area, that a single re-certification of the initial sales tax amount shall be made when the CFO advises that the new financial systems of the District have been implemented. Any re-certified initial sales tax amount shall control, regardless of whether it results in an increase or a decrease from the amount initially certified.</text>

    <text>Within 60 days after the approval of a project by resolution of the Council, the CFO shall provide for the allocation of property tax increment revenues or sales tax increment revenues, or both, within each TIF area.  The CFO shall establish one or more separate tax increment allocation accounts within the General Fund for the deposit and application of property tax increment revenues and sales tax increment revenues from each tax increment area. Monies shall be transferred from such accounts at the times and in the amounts required pursuant to financing documents under §§ <cite path="§2-1217.02">2-1217.02</cite> and <cite path="§2-1217.07">2-1217.07</cite> to any fund or account established under such documents for the purpose specified in those documents or may, as provided in the bond documents, be transferred directly from the collector to such funds and accounts. Pursuant to subsections (c), (d), and (e) of this section, monies held or to be held in a tax allocation account or such funds and accounts established under financing documents may be used to pay development costs associated with projects in the applicable tax increment area, to pay the principal of and interest on the TIF bonds issued with respect to such tax increment area, and otherwise applied as indicated in subsection (e) of this section consistent with the applicable bond documents.  Monies in a tax allocation account or in any fund or account established under the financing documents may be pledged as security for the payment of TIF bonds issued to finance development costs with respect to the applicable tax increment area and to related purposes referred to in subsection (e) of this section.</text>
