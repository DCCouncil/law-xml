    <text type="Editor's Notes">“(15) The assemblage of the properties comprising the Skyland Shopping Center and the construction of a new shopping center on the site, guided by the policies and requirements of the District government including the Corporation, will further many important public purposes including:</text>
    <text type="Editor's Notes">“(14) The assemblage of the properties comprising the Skyland Shopping Center is necessary to allow for the proposed redevelopment and it is highly unlikely that the properties could be assembled without the involvement of the District government and without the authority to exercise eminent domain by the Corporation.</text>
    <text type="Editor's Notes">“(13) The Corporation has proposed a redevelopment of the Skyland Shopping Center that will create hundreds of new jobs, attract businesses that are desired by the community, and stimulate economic activity east the Anacostia River.</text>
    <text type="Editor's Notes">“(12) The National Capital Revitalization Corporation (”Corporation“) has advised the Council that the Skyland Shopping Center is blighted and that current conditions are an impediment to the economic revitalization of this area of the District.</text>
    <text type="Editor's Notes">“(11) For over 15 years, residents near the shopping center have petitioned the District to become involved in the redevelopment of the area and the correction of conditions at the site.</text>
    <text type="Editor's Notes">“(10) Neither the police nor the community have been able to secure the cooperation of the current owners to deal with the numerous problems at the site despite years of efforts.</text>
    <text type="Editor's Notes">“(9) The fragmented and often absentee ownership of the properties has exacerbated these problems by allowing individual owners to avoid responsibility for safety and the reduction of crime, trash, and other blighting factors.</text>
    <text type="Editor's Notes">“(8) The layout of the current shopping center is unsafe for both motorists and pedestrians.</text>
    <text type="Editor's Notes">“(7) The Skyland Shopping Center has been the site of a significant amount of stray and illegally dumped garbage, which the current owners have not removed in a timely manner and which has created an eyesore and nuisance in the community.</text>
    <text type="Editor's Notes">“(6) These poor conditions of the Skyland Shopping Center have fueled crime and attracted criminal elements to the site and is likely to have increased the incidence of crime in the surrounding neighborhoods.</text>
    <text type="Editor's Notes">“(5) The Skyland Shopping Center is characterized by underused, neglected, and poorly maintained properties.</text>
    <text type="Editor's Notes">“(4) The Skyland Shopping Center is a blighting factor in the Hillcrest and nearby communities.</text>
    <text type="Editor's Notes">“(3) One of the key reasons why these areas lag behind is because certain critical commercial locations are run down or blighted.</text>
    <text type="Editor's Notes">“(2) Wards 7 and 8 including the neighborhoods surrounding the Skyland Shopping Center remain economically depressed and underserved by the amenities enjoyed by the rest of the District and nearby Maryland.</text>
    <text type="Editor's Notes">“(1) The communities east of the Anacostia River, including the areas near the Skyland Shopping Center, have lagged behind other communities in the District in economic development and have the highest unemployment rates in the District.</text>
