Neither the Department of Human Services nor the Director of Social Services shall deliver a child under the age of 13 to the custody of the United States Marshals Service. For the purposes of this section, “child at risk” means a child under the age of 13 or any child 13 years of age or older who, because of his or her size or physical stature, is determined to be especially physically or psychologically vulnerable to attacks by other children.</text>
