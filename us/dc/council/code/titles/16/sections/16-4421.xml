    <text>As to all remedies other than those authorized by subsections (a) and (b) of this section, an arbitrator may order such remedies as the arbitrator considers just and appropriate under the circumstances of the arbitration proceeding. The fact that such a remedy could not or would not be granted by the court is not a ground for refusing to confirm an award under <cite path="§16-4422">§ 16-4422</cite> or for vacating an award under <cite path="§16-4423">§ 16-4423</cite>.</text>
