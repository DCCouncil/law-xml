  <heading>Judicial enforcement of preaward ruling by arbitrator.</heading>
  <text>If an arbitrator makes a preaward ruling in favor of a party to the arbitration proceeding, the party may request the arbitrator to incorporate the ruling into an award under <cite path="§16-4419">§ 16-4419</cite>. A prevailing party may make a motion to the court for an expedited order to confirm the award under <cite path="§16-4422">§ 16-4422</cite>, in which case the court shall summarily decide the motion. The court shall issue an order to confirm the award unless the court vacates, modifies, or corrects the award under <cite path="§16-4423">§ 16-4423</cite> or 16-4424.</text>
