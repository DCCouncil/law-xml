    <text type="Editor's Notes">Section 4(l)(3)-(6) of D.C. Law 7-104 purported to substitute “7-213” for “7-214” 1981 Ed., and “7-214” for “7-215” 1981 Ed. in subsection (a), “7-322” for “7-323” 1981 Ed. in subsections (a) and (c), and “7-301” for “7301” 1981 Ed. in subsection (c), apparently without regard to the amendment to this section by D.C. Law 4-201.</text>
