  <text>The District of Columbia currently lacks statutory authority to act as custodian for substantial sums of abandoned personal property within its jurisdiction. This chapter is intended to mandate the report and delivery by holders and to authorize the receipt for safekeeping and fiscal growth by the District of Columbia of any and all personal property which is abandoned, without regard either to any maximum length of time for which such property was abandoned or to any statute limiting the right to sue to claim such property.</text>
