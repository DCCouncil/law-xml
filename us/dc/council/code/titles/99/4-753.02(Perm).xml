      <text>An individual or family is eligible to receive services within the Continuum of Care if the individual or family:</text>

      <text>In determining whether an applicant can demonstrate residency pursuant to <u>§ 4-751.01(32)</u>, the Department shall search Department databases and other data systems to which it has access to assist individuals and families in demonstrating residency.</text>

      <text>If the Mayor determines that an individual or family has an ownership interest in safe housing or is listed on a lease or occupancy agreement for safe housing, the Mayor may presume that the individual or family is not eligible for shelter, unless the individual or family provides credible evidence that the individual or family cannot safely inhabit the housing associated with the lease or occupancy agreement. This presumption shall not apply to individuals or families seeking shelter for reasons of domestic violence, sexual assault, or human trafficking. Additionally, this presumption shall not affect an individual's or family's eligibility for crisis intervention services, including family mediation, conflict resolution, or other family stabilization services.</text>
