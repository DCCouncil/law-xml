    <text>This chapter applies to all transfers made before the effective date of the District of Columbia Uniform Transfers to Minors Act in a manner and form prescribed in the District of Columbia Uniform Gifts to Minors Act, except insofar as the application impairs constitutionally vested rights or extends the duration of custodianships existing on the effective date of the District of Columbia Uniform Transfers to Minors Act.</text>
