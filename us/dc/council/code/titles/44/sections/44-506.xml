    <text type="Editor's Notes">Section 112 of <cite doc="D.C. Law 19-171">D.C. Law 19-171</cite> amended subsection (e) of this section by striking the phrase “with <cite path="§44-504|(a)|(3)">§ 44-504(a)(3)</cite>” and inserting the phrase “with section 8(a)(3) [of <cite doc="D.C. Law 5-48">D.C. Law 5-48</cite>]” in its place. The legislative intent was to substitute in the phrase “with section 5(a)(3),” codified as <cite path="§44-504|(a)|(3)">§ 44-504(a)(3)</cite>, rather than the phrase “with section 8(a)(3),” and has been implemented accordingly.</text>
