In addition, in lieu of appointing a receiver when a petition for receivership has been filed, the court may, on either its own motion or the motion of a party, appoint a monitor instead. The grounds and procedures set forth in §§ <cite path="§44-1002.02">44-1002.02</cite> to <cite path="§44-1002.05">44-1002.05</cite>, except for the requirement of a bond in <cite path="§44-1002.05|(c)">§ 44-1002.05(c)</cite>, shall apply to the appointment of a monitor. The appointment of a monitor may be terminated by the court for any of the reasons listed in <cite path="§44-1002.07|(a)">§ 44-1002.07(a)</cite> or if the court determines that a receiver should be appointed.</text>
