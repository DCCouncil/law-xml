    <text>All continuing care facilities shall maintain, after opening, operating reserves equal to 20% of the total operating costs projected for the 12-month period following the period covered by the most recent annual disclosure statement filed. The forecast statements as required shall serve as the basis for computing the operating reserve. In addition to total operating expenses, total operating costs shall include debt service, consisting of principal and interest payments and taxes and insurance on any mortgage loan or other long-term financing, but shall exclude depreciation, amortized expenses, and extraordinary items as may be approved by regulation. If the debt service portion is accounted for by way of another reserve account, the debt service portion may be excluded. The operating reserves may be funded by cash, invested cash, commercial paper, or by investment grade securities, including bonds, stocks, United States Treasury obligations, or obligations of United States government agencies.</text>
