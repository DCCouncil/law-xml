      <text>The Mayor may, prior to a hearing, suspend the license of any facility or agency or convert its license to a provisional or restricted license if he or she determines that existing deficiencies constitute an immediate or serious and continuing danger to the health, safety, or welfare of its patients/clients/residents.</text>

      <text>Upon the suspension or conversion of a license pursuant to this subsection, the Mayor shall immediately give the facility or agency written notice of the action, including a copy of the order of suspension or conversion, a statement of the grounds for the action, and notification that the facility or agency has 7 days (excluding Saturdays, Sundays, and legal holidays) from the day written notice is received to request an expedited, preliminary review hearing. If the facility or agency fails to communicate, either orally or in writing, a timely request for a preliminary review hearing, the order of suspension or conversion shall remain in effect until terminated by the Mayor or an unexpedited hearing is held pursuant to procedures adopted under <cite path="§44-504">§ 44-504</cite>. Upon receipt of a timely request for an expedited, preliminary review hearing, the Mayor shall within 72 hours (excluding Saturdays, Sundays, and legal holidays) provide a hearing to review the reasonableness of the suspension or conversion order. At this hearing, the Mayor shall have the burden of establishing a prima facie case of immediate or serious and continuing endangerment. The suspension or conversion order shall be either affirmed or vacated at the hearing. In the event an order is affirmed, it shall, unless extended, remain in effect for no longer than 30 calendar days, during which time a final hearing shall be scheduled to consider the appropriateness of revocation or continuing restrictions on licensure. Before expiration of a suspension or conversion order, an extension may be granted for a period not to exceed an additional 30 calendar days upon agreement of all the parties or for good cause shown.</text>
